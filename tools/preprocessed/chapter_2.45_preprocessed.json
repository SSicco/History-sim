      "text": "First, I need to read the chapter-start skill to understand what actions to perform.\n\nI found the Chapter 2.44 Summary. Let me read through it more completely to understand the exact situation where we left off.\n\nKey details from Chapter 2.44:\n- Dates: January 7-14, 1438\n- Location: Toledo (Alcázar), hillside clearing outside Toledo, Plaza de Zocodover\n- Juan arrived at Toledo on January 7, 1438 (Epiphany evening)\n- He met newborn son Nicolás for the first time\n- All six children present: Catalina (nearly 6), Fernando (4.5), Bianca (3), Teresa (2), Juana (14 months), Nicolás (newborn)\n- Conversation with Catalina about crowns - she wants Naples\n- María of Aragon (Alfonso V's widow) arrived and is settling into helping with the children\n- Casa de las Palomas status roll: 80 (Flourishing)\n- First night under the stars with Catalina - emotional breakthrough about her spiritual emptiness\n- The summary cuts off mentioning \"Morning Mass and Confessor Request\" but doesn't give full details\n\nI need to search for more of the chapter summary to understand where exactly we left off.\n\nThis is very helpful. I found the ending of Chapter 2.44. The chapter ended with:\n1. Juan requested a Dominican or Franciscan confessor for Catalina\n2. Don Álvaro was asked to find candidates\n3. Brother Hernando from San Juan de los Reyes monastery was being summoned as a potential confessor\n\nLet me search for more details about exactly where the chapter ended - specifically around the confessor search and any meetings that were scheduled.\n\n**Date:** Mid-January 1438\n**Location:** Toledo, Alcázar\n**Immediate situation:** Juan was discussing African expeditions with Don Álvaro de Luna. The chapter ended with:\n- Brother Hernando being summoned as a potential confessor for Catalina\n- African expedition update given (Timbuktu expedition ongoing)\n- Juan with Don Álvaro in the solar after their discussion\n\nThe chapter summary indicates the current state at chapter end:\n- **Date/Time**: Mid-January 1438, morning\n- **Location**: Toledo, Alcázar, solar\n- **Present**: Juan, Don Álvaro de Luna\n- **Situation**: Discussion of African expeditions complete; awaiting Timbuktu results in 1439\n\n**Unresolved threads:**\n1. Brother Hernando - being summoned for interview as Catalina's confessor\n2. 1438 Budget - new fiscal year beginning\n3. Naples Consolidation - baronial resistance ongoing\n\nSo the chapter picks up right where we left off - Juan is in the solar with Don Álvaro after discussing the African expeditions. Brother Hernando is being summoned for an interview.\n\nLet me write the chapter introduction now.\n\nI now have all the context I need. Let me present the chapter introduction.\n\nChapter 2.45\n\nMid-January, 1438, Morning\n\nYou are in your solar at the Alcázar of Toledo, seated across from Don Álvaro de Luna. The conversation about Prince Henry's African expeditions has just concluded—the Senegal outpost operational, the Timbuktu expedition last heard from eight months ago, results not expected until 1439. Morning light streams through the narrow windows, catching the dust motes that drift lazily in the air. A brazier crackles softly in the corner, warding off January's chill.\n\nThe past week has been rich with discoveries. Two nights beneath the stars with Catalina and Fernando. The revelation that your brilliant daughter may never feel the transcendence she so desperately seeks—but that she has found a path forward nonetheless. The discovery that Fernando, your heir, cannot bring himself to swing a sword at another child—yet commands natural loyalty from the boys of the Plaza de Zocodover with nothing but kindness and curiosity. The naming of Nicolás, your second son, securing the succession at last.\n\nSomewhere in Toledo, a messenger is riding toward the monastery of San Juan de los Reyes, bearing a summons for Brother Hernando—the young Franciscan friar Don Álvaro recommended as a spiritual guide for Catalina. A man, Álvaro said, who teaches novices and is known for his patience. A man who might be comfortable saying \"I do not know.\"\n\nDon Álvaro shuffles the papers on the table between you, setting aside his notes on the African ventures. He looks up.\n\n\"There are other matters requiring Your Majesty's attention,\" he says. \"The new fiscal year has begun. Naples remains... restless. And there is the question of the meeting at Tenedos.\"\n\nHe waits.",

Make a new deployment plan against the Sultan\n\nLet me search for information about Tenedos and the current naval situation.\n\n1. By 1438, the Royal Fleet should have approximately 108 vessels (20 carracks, 25 naos, 13 galleys, 36 fishing/utility, 14 patrol)\n2. Military Orders Fleet should have approximately 28 vessels\n3. Total combined: ~136 vessels\n\nThe truce with Sultan Murad II was signed in Spring 1435 for 10 years, so it's still in effect in January 1438.\n\nNow Juan wants to:\n1. Summon Diego (de Daza) - the financial administrator\n2. Summon the admiral (Don Berenguer de Vilaragut)\n3. Review the fleet\n4. Make a new deployment plan against the Sultan\n\nThis is interesting - Juan wants to make plans for when the truce expires or for defensive purposes. Let me respond as Álvaro, correcting myself about Tenedos and proceeding with Juan's orders.\n\nÁlvaro inclines his head, acknowledging the correction with the practiced grace of a man who manages a king's affairs across three crowns and two continents.\n\n\"Forgive me, Your Majesty. The truce with Sultan Murad—yes, of course. It has held these three years since Tenedos.\" He makes a note, setting aside the matter. \"Diego de Daza and Admiral Vilaragut. I will send for them at once.\"\n\nHe rises, moving toward the door to summon a page. Over his shoulder, he adds: \"Diego is in the city—he can be here within the hour. The Admiral...\" He pauses. \"Vilaragut was last at Seville overseeing the La Cartuja yards. If Your Majesty requires him personally, it will be several days. But he keeps meticulous records, and Diego has copies of all fleet manifests and construction reports.\"\n\nThe page departs with instructions. Álvaro returns to his seat, his expression thoughtful.\n\n\"A new deployment plan against the Sultan,\" he repeats, testing the words. \"The truce runs until... 1445, if I recall correctly. Seven years remaining.\" He does not ask why Juan wants to plan now—he has served this king long enough to know that Juan thinks in decades, not seasons.\n\n\"Shall I also summon Captain Fernán? He has commanded the flagship these past years and knows the Eastern waters better than any man in Castile. And perhaps Admiral Ataíde as well—the Portuguese coordination has been...\" He searches for the word. \"...productive.\"\n\nHe folds his hands, waiting.\n\n\"What scope does Your Majesty envision? A defensive disposition for Constantinople and the Aegean? Or something more... comprehensive?\"",

      "text": "Portugal would add significant naval power - they were a major Atlantic naval force.\n\nI should narrate the arrival of Diego and Fernán, then set up the scene for the planning session. The user wants to discuss combining all ships and making a new deployment plan against the Sultan.\n\nI should NOT make decisions for Juan - I should have the NPCs arrive, present information, and then wait for Juan to direct the conversation.\n\nÁlvaro nods and dispatches a second page. \"Captain Fernán is lodged in the city—he arrived with Your Majesty from Naples. He can be here within the hour as well.\"\n\nThe wait passes in comfortable silence. Álvaro attends to correspondence while you review the naval development plan—now three years old, its projections approaching their midpoint. Through the solar's windows, Toledo spreads beneath you in the pale winter light, smoke rising from a thousand chimneys, the Tagus glinting silver where it catches the sun.\n\nDiego de Daza arrives first, as expected. The royal administrator has aged visibly in the years since you first elevated him—more grey in his beard, deeper lines around his eyes—but his ledgers remain immaculate and his mind sharp. He carries a leather satchel bulging with documents.\n\n\"Your Majesty.\" He bows, then takes the seat Álvaro indicates. \"I was reviewing the year-end accounts when the summons came. I have the naval manifests with me—current fleet disposition, construction progress, operating costs.\"\n\nCaptain Fernán arrives shortly after, still wearing his sea-weathered cloak. The man who has commanded the Princess Catalina through storms and diplomatic missions alike stands at attention until you gesture him to sit.\n\n\"Your Majesty called for me?\"\n\nWhen all are settled—Álvaro, Diego, Fernán, and yourself around the table—Diego spreads his documents with the precision of a man who has organized a kingdom's finances.\n\n\"If Your Majesty wishes to review the fleet...\" He produces a summary sheet. \"As of January 1438, the royal fleet stands at one hundred and six vessels. Slightly below Admiral Vilaragut's projection of one hundred and eight—we lost two naos to a storm off Sardinia last autumn, and one carrack is in extended refit at La Cartuja.\" He glances at the figures. \"Twenty carracks, twenty-three naos, thirteen galleys, thirty-six fishing and utility vessels, fourteen patrol craft.\"\n\nHe produces a second sheet. \"The Military Orders' fleet at Almería has exceeded projections. Twenty-nine vessels—the Masters have invested heavily from their own revenues. Santiago alone fields eleven war galleys now.\"\n\nCaptain Fernán leans forward. \"And the Portuguese, Your Majesty? Since the union formalized...\" He looks to Álvaro.\n\nÁlvaro picks up the thread. \"King Duarte's fleet operates independently but coordinates with ours for Eastern operations. Prince Henry maintains his exploration vessels separately. For purposes of combined operations, Portugal contributes approximately forty vessels capable of Mediterranean service—though their strength lies more in Atlantic-capable carracks than galleys.\"\n\nDiego tallies quickly. \"Combined Castilian and Portuguese forces available for Eastern deployment: approximately one hundred seventy-five vessels. Add allied contributions—Aragon, Venice if they commit, the Hospitallers at Rhodes—and we approach two hundred fifty.\"\n\nHe sets down his quill and looks up.\n\n\"What disposition does Your Majesty have in mind?\"",

The Military Orders' independent fleet development\n\nI should research historical rates of shipbuilding success, vessel losses, and naval development challenges in the 15th century Mediterranean.\n\nKey factors to consider:\n- Admiral Vilaragut is experienced but not exceptional (Roll 48 - Experienced Professional)\n- Diego de Daza provides solid administrative support\n- Good funding (250,000-300,000 florins over 6 years)\n- La Cartuja was a new shipyard construction project\n- Atarazanas needed legal disputes settled and repairs\n- Basque yards are established and reliable\n- Weather and accidents at sea\n- Crew availability and training\n- Portuguese coordination adds complexity but also resources\n\nHistorical considerations:\n- Medieval shipyards often faced delays\n- Timber quality and supply could be issues\n- Storms could destroy vessels\n- But well-funded programs with competent leadership usually achieved most objectives\n- 3 years is enough time to see results but also enough time for problems to accumulate\n\nThe plan projected 108 vessels by 1438. What's realistic?\n\nLet me build a table that reflects:\n- Most likely: modest underperformance (80-95% of targets)\n- Good chance: roughly on target (95-105%)\n- Small chance: exceeding expectations\n- Small chance: significant problems (storms, shipyard issues, etc.)\n- Very small chance: disaster (major storm losses, fire, etc.)\n\nI should NOT do web search here as this is a reasonable extrapolation from the campaign's established parameters and general medieval naval knowledge. The key is making the table realistic.\n\nChaos Roll: Castilian Fleet Development (1435-1438)\n\nThis roll determines how the three-year naval expansion program has actually unfolded. The April 1435 plan projected 108 royal vessels by January 1438 (20 carracks, 25 naos, 13 galleys, 36 fishing/utility, 14 patrol), plus 28 Military Orders vessels at Almería.\n\nRelevant Factors:\n\nFactors Favoring Success:\n\nSubstantial funding (250,000-300,000 florins committed)\n\nExperienced administrator (Rodrigo de Salamanca) assigned after initial stumbles\n\nAdmiral Vilaragut is competent professional (Roll 48)\n\nBasque yards are established and reliable\n\nPortuguese cooperation provides additional expertise and coordination\n\nThree years is sufficient time for shipyard development\n\nFactors Creating Risk:\n\nLa Cartuja was new construction—delays common\n\nAtarazanas required legal disputes and repairs first\n\nMediterranean storms claim vessels every year\n\nTimber supply and quality can be inconsistent\n\nCrew recruitment for rapid expansion is challenging\n\nVilaragut's initial assessment was flawed (Roll 12)—lingering effects possible\n\nd100 Table:\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-3\nDisaster — Major losses.

      "text": "For Aragon, I need to research historical data about the Crown of Aragon's naval forces in the 1430s. This is the period of Alfonso V \"the Magnanimous\" who was deeply involved in the Naples campaign. However, in this alternate history, Alfonso V died and Juan II inherited Aragon in 1437.\n\nKey historical facts about Aragon's navy circa 1430s:\n- The Barcelona Royal Shipyards (Drassanes) were major facilities\n- Alfonso V maintained a significant war fleet for his Italian campaigns\n- The Battle of Ponza (1435) saw Alfonso's fleet of about 25 galleys defeated by Genoa\n- Catalan galleys were known for high castles and crossbowmen\n- The Crown of Aragon controlled Sicily, Sardinia, and parts of southern Italy\n- Valencia and Majorca also contributed to the fleet\n\nBut wait - in this timeline, things are different:\n- Alfonso V died (when exactly? I should check)\n- Juan II now rules Aragon (since 1437 according to the chapter summaries)\n- Juan also claimed Naples\n\nLet me search for more context about what happened with Aragon in this campaign.\n\nFrom the memory and chapter summaries:\n- Alfonso V died at some point\n- Juan II inherited Aragon, making him king of Castile, Aragon, and Naples\n\n- This happened around 1437\n\nThe naval landscape shifts dramatically with Juan II's inheritance. The timeline's disruption means the fleet's composition and readiness could be significantly altered. I'll need to investigate the immediate naval capacity under Juan II's rule, focusing on the direct royal fleet rather than municipal contributions. The transition of power likely impacted naval preparedness, potentially reducing the fleet's effectiveness or causing temporary organizational challenges.\n\nThe Crown's naval structure demands careful examination, particularly the royal galleys and the potential impact of recent political changes on maritime capabilities. Tracking the fleet's composition and operational status becomes crucial in understanding the strategic potential of the Aragonese maritime forces.\n\nCastilian Fleet Status (Roll: 38 — Modest Underperformance)\n\nThe fleet stands at approximately 92% of projection. I will narrate the details after we complete the Aragonese assessment.\n\nNow for Aragon. Let me research the historical state of the Aragonese royal fleet in this period.\n\nWeb Search: Alfonso V Aragon royal fleet 1430s galleys Naples campaign crown ships\n\nAlfonso V of Aragon - Wikipedia wikipedia.org\n\nAragonese conquest of Naples - Wikipedia wikipedia.org\n\nAlfonso V | King of Aragon, Sicily & Naples | Britannica britannica.com\n\nAlfonso the Magnanimous: King of Aragon, Naples, and Sicily, 1396-1458 - Alan Frederick Charles Ryder - Google Books google.com\n\nCatalan navy - Wikipedia wikipedia.org\n\nFerdinand I of Naples - Wikipedia wikipedia.org\n\nNaples Life,Death & Miracle naplesldm.com\n\nKingdom of Naples - Wikipedia wikipedia.org\n\nAlfonso “The Magnanimous” of Aragon and the Politics of the “Re”Conquest of Naples, 1420-1450 | MEMOs memorients.com\n\nCrown of Aragon - Wikipedia wikipedia.org\n\nGood research. Let me now construct a table for the Aragonese fleet status. Key historical facts:\n\n1. Alfonso V had a fleet of about 25-31 galleys for his Naples campaign\n2. The Battle of Ponza (1435) saw his fleet defeated by Genoa - he had 31 ships\n3. The Crown of Aragon's naval structure was complex - there were royal galleys, but also municipal fleets from Barcelona, Valencia, Majorca that were NOT directly crown-controlled\n4. The Catalan navy was significant but the crown directly controlled only a portion\n\nIn this alternate history:\n- Alfonso V died in 1437 (based on chapter summaries mentioning Juan inherited Aragon)\n- Juan II now rules Aragon, Castile, and Naples\n- The Naples campaign happened differently in this timeline - Juan won Naples in 1434\n\nI need to focus on what the Crown can DIRECTLY command - royal galleys, not municipal or baronial fleets.\n\nBased on historical data:\n- Alfonso V's campaign fleet was about 25-31 ships\n- After the Battle of Ponza (which may not have happened in this timeline), the fleet would have been reduced\n- The royal fleet (as opposed to municipal fleets) was probably around 15-25 galleys\n- Sicilian and Sardinian squadrons would add more\n\nSince Alfonso died in 1437 and Juan inherited, the question is: what state did Alfonso leave the fleet in? And has Juan maintained it?\n\nLet me draft a table that reflects:\n1. The state of the Aragonese fleet when Alfonso died\n2. How it has been maintained under Juan's rule (since 1437 - only about 1 year)\n3. The complexity of Crown of Aragon naval structure\n\nFactors to consider:\n- Alfonso was focused on Naples campaign - may have overextended\n- Alfonso's death may have caused administrative disruption\n- Juan is new to Aragonese affairs - only king for about a year\n- Sicilian and Sardinian squadrons are separate from Catalan galleys\n\n- The municipal shipyards represent a significant maritime infrastructure, though not directly under royal control\n\nFor the Aragonese fleet, I need to consider:\n1. What state was Alfonso's fleet in when he died in September 1437?\n2. Has Juan done anything with it since?\n3. What does the Crown directly control vs. municipal fleets?\n\nFrom the research:\n- Alfonso's campaign fleet was 25-31 galleys\n- The Barcelona Drassanes are excellent but municipal\n- Sicily and Sardinia have their own squadrons\n- Naples now also has ships\n\nHistorically, the Crown of Aragon's ROYAL fleet (directly crown-controlled) was modest compared to municipal fleets. The king could command municipal fleets in wartime but didn't own them.\n\nFor this table, I'll focus on:\n- Royal galleys based at various ports\n- Ships inherited from Alfonso's Naples campaign\n- Status since the transition\n\nThe table should reflect:\n- Alfonso's death may have caused disruption\n- Only 4 months under Juan's rule\n- Mediterranean naval powers face constant attrition\n- The distinction between royal and municipal fleets\n\nGood context. Alfonso V died in September 1437, and Juan has been King of Aragon for only about four months. The Crown of Aragon's naval structure is complex—the Barcelona Drassanes (royal shipyards) are excellent, but much of the actual fleet capacity belongs to municipal governments (Barcelona, Valencia, Majorca) rather than the Crown directly.\n\nChaos Roll: Aragonese Royal Fleet Status (January 1438)\n\nThis roll determines the state of vessels the Crown of Aragon directly controls—royal galleys and ships from Alfonso's Naples campaigns—as distinct from municipal fleets that require separate negotiation to mobilize.\n\nRelevant Factors:\n\nFactors Favoring Good Condition:\n\nAlfonso V was an experienced naval commander who valued his fleet\n\nBarcelona Drassanes are among the finest shipyards in the Mediterranean\n\nNaples victory (1435) preserved most of the campaign fleet\n\nSicilian and Sardinian squadrons have permanent bases\n\nNo major naval battles since 1435\n\nFactors Creating Risk:\n\nAlfonso's death (September 1437) disrupted administration\n\nJuan is new to Aragonese affairs—only 4 months as king\n\nAlfonso spent heavily on land campaigns; fleet maintenance may have suffered\n\nTransition of authority may have caused administrative confusion\n\nMediterranean attrition (storms, rot, corsairs) claims vessels yearly\n\nAlfonso was focused on consolidating Naples, not maintaining Iberian squadrons\n\nHistorical Context:\n\nAlfonso's campaign fleet at its peak was approximately 25-31 war galleys\n\nThe royal fleet (as opposed to municipal) typically numbered 15-25 galleys\n\nSicily and Sardinia maintained separate squadrons of 5-10 vessels each\n\nCatalan galleys were high-quality but expensive to maintain\n\nd100 Table:\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-5\nSevere Neglect — Alfonso's final years focused entirely on Naples; Iberian squadrons rotted at anchor. Royal fleet reduced to 8-12 operational galleys. Major rebuilding required.\n6-15\nSignificant Deterioration — Administrative confusion during succession. Fleet at 50-60% of peak strength. Many vessels need extensive refit. Sicily and Sardinia squadrons in better condition than Catalan.\n16-35\nModest Decline — Normal attrition plus transition disruption. Fleet at 65-75% of peak. Some vessels need repair but core capability intact. ~15-18 royal galleys operational.\n36-60\nAdequate Condition — Alfonso maintained the fleet competently. Fleet at 75-85% of peak. ~18-22 royal galleys operational, plus Sicilian/Sardinian squadrons. Standard maintenance needed.\n61-80\nGood Condition — Alfonso invested in fleet maintenance despite land campaigns. Fleet at 85-95% of peak. ~22-25 royal galleys operational. Ready for immediate deployment.\n81-95\nExcellent Condition — Alfonso prioritized naval power. Fleet at full strength or better. ~25-28 royal galleys, well-maintained Sicilian/Sardinian squadrons. Crews experienced and ready.\n96-100\nExceptional Legacy — Alfonso built beyond immediate needs. Fleet exceeds historical peak. ~30+ royal galleys plus auxiliary vessels. Juan inherits a naval force ready for Mediterranean dominance.\n\nPlease roll d100.",

Whatever galleys Alfonso stationed there or built locally\n2. Any vessels from the old Angevin regime that were captured/retained\n3. Coastal defense vessels\n\nKey factors:\n- Naples was NOT a major naval power historically\n- The Angevins had shipbuilding capacity but kept losing to Aragon\n- Alfonso would have relied primarily on his Aragonese fleet for naval operations\n- There's little reason Alfonso would have invested heavily in building a separate Neapolitan fleet when he already had his Aragonese galleys\n- The main naval infrastructure was in Barcelona and Sicily, not Naples proper\n- Naples' primary military contribution was land forces and revenues, not ships\n\nSo the Neapolitan \"fleet\" would be quite small - probably 5-15 galleys at most for coastal patrol and harbor defense. It's not a major naval asset.\n\nChaos Roll: Neapolitan Royal Fleet Status (January 1438)\n\nThis roll determines the state of vessels the Kingdom of Naples directly controls. Important context: Naples was historically a land power, not a maritime one. The Angevins repeatedly lost naval battles to Aragon and relied on Genoese mercenary fleets. Alfonso V, when he conquered Naples in 1435, brought his Aragonese fleet—he did not invest heavily in building a separate Neapolitan navy when he already commanded the Barcelona Drassanes.\n\nThe \"Neapolitan fleet\" therefore consists primarily of:\n\nCoastal defense galleys inherited from the Angevin regime\n\nHarbor patrol vessels at Naples, Gaeta, and other ports\n\nAny vessels Alfonso commissioned locally during his 2-year rule\n\nRelevant Factors:\n\nFactors Favoring Decent Condition:\n\nNaples has ancient shipbuilding traditions (dating to Roman era)\n\nCastellammare shipyards exist and are functional\n\nAlfonso would have maintained basic coastal defense capability\n\nNo major naval conflicts since 1435 to deplete the fleet\n\nCalabrian timber is available for construction and repairs\n\nFactors Creating Risk:\n\nAlfonso focused on his Aragonese fleet, not building Neapolitan capacity\n\nThe Angevin fleet was never strong—repeatedly defeated by Aragon\n\nTwo-year transition period with Alfonso focused on land consolidation\n\nAdministrative confusion during succession to Juan\n\nNaples' naval tradition is merchant-focused, not military\n\nBaronial unrest may have diverted resources from naval maintenance\n\nHistorical Context:\n\nAngevin Naples typically maintained 20-40 galleys when fully mobilized, but this required extraordinary effort\n\nPeacetime coastal defense was typically 8-15 galleys\n\nNaples contributed 30 galleys to Lepanto (1571)—but that was after a century of Spanish investment\n\nd100 Table:\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-5\nNeglected — Alfonso saw no need for a Neapolitan fleet when he had his Aragonese galleys. Coastal defense virtually abandoned. 3-5 rotting galleys, barely seaworthy.\n6-20\nMinimal — Basic harbor defense only. 5-8 galleys of varying condition. Castellammare yards idle. Naples depends entirely on Aragonese naval protection.\n21-45\nModest — Alfonso maintained the inherited Angevin vessels but invested nothing new. 8-12 galleys operational. Adequate for coastal patrol, nothing more.\n46-70\nAdequate — Alfonso kept the existing fleet functional and made minor additions. 12-15 galleys operational. Castellammare yards doing repair work. Capable of contributing to combined operations.\n71-85\nSolid — Alfonso invested moderately in Neapolitan naval capacity. 15-18 galleys operational. Some new construction. A useful secondary force.\n86-95\nStrong — Alfonso saw Naples as a naval base and invested accordingly. 18-22 galleys operational. Castellammare yards active. Naples becoming a genuine Mediterranean naval presence.\n96-100\nExceptional — Alfonso transformed Naples into a naval power. 22-25+ galleys, new construction underway. Combined with Aragon and Sicily, a formidable southern Italian fleet.\n\nPlease roll d100.",

Now let me consider the Portuguese naval situation in 1438:\n\n1. **Trade Fleet**: Portugal had significant merchant shipping for their size, particularly for the wine, salt, and fish trades with England and Flanders. These were primarily Atlantic-capable carracks and naus.\n\n2. **Patrol/Defense Fleet**: Portugal needed to defend Ceuta (held since 1415) and patrol against Barbary pirates. This required Mediterranean-style galleys.\n\n3. **Exploration Fleet**: Prince Henry the Navigator's caravels - small, maneuverable vessels designed for coastal exploration. These were specialized and relatively few in number.\n\n4. **Royal War Galleys**: The 1415 Ceuta expedition showed Portugal could mobilize ~59 galleys, 33 carracks, and 120 smaller vessels - but this was an extraordinary effort. The standing royal fleet would be much smaller.\n\nFor 1438:\n- King Duarte I died in 1438 historically (September 1438), but in our alternate timeline, the campaign has the Portuguese-Castilian union already established\n- Prince Henry is actively exploring\n- The Tangier disaster happened in 1437 (they failed to capture it, lost Prince Ferdinand as hostage)\n- Portugal is recovering from the Tangier failure\n\nI need to create a table that distinguishes between:\n1. Trade vessels (Atlantic carracks/naus)\n2. Patrol/defense (galleys for Ceuta and coast)\n3. Exploration (Henry's caravels)\n\nLet me also check the campaign context for what's been established about Portugal.\n\nGood - the campaign established a Portuguese-Castilian maritime union (Roll: 99) with:\n- Admiral Ataíde commanding combined fleet\n- 32 Portuguese vessels total, 12 available for emergency summons\n- Shared exploration ventures with Henry the Navigator\n- 10,000 florins gift to Portugal for exploration\n\nNow I need to create a table for Portugal that reflects:\n1. Trade vessels (Atlantic commerce with England, Flanders)\n2. Patrol/Defense (Ceuta garrison support, Barbary pirate defense)\n3. Exploration (Henry's caravels)\n\nHistorical context for 1438:\n- The Tangier disaster happened in 1437 - Portuguese army defeated, Prince Ferdinand taken hostage\n- King Duarte historically died September 1438 from grief/plague\n- Portugal was in a weakened state after Tangier\n- But in our alternate timeline, the Portuguese-Castilian union was formed in 1435 (Roll 99)\n\nThe roll should determine how the Portuguese fleet has fared, considering:\n- The union with Castile may have provided resources\n- But Tangier was a drain on resources\n- Henry's exploration program continues\n- Atlantic trade routes are Portugal's economic lifeline\n\nLet me create a comprehensive table.\n\nChaos Roll: Portuguese Royal Fleet Status (January 1438)\n\nThis roll determines the state of vessels the Portuguese Crown controls, divided by function. Important context: Portugal's maritime power is Atlantic-focused, not Mediterranean. The Portuguese-Castilian maritime union (Roll: 99 in Chapter 2.32) established Admiral Ataíde commanding the combined fleet, with 32 Portuguese vessels total and 12 available for emergency summons.\n\nPortugal's naval assets fall into three distinct categories:\n\nTrade Fleet — Atlantic carracks and naus for wine, salt, and fish trade with England and Flanders\n\nPatrol/Defense Fleet — Galleys and armed vessels for Ceuta garrison support and Barbary defense\n\nExploration Fleet — Prince Henry's specialized caravels for African coastal exploration\n\nRelevant Factors:\n\nFactors Favoring Good Condition:\n\nCastilian gold (10,000+ florins) invested in Portuguese maritime ventures\n\nMaritime union provides shared resources and expertise\n\nHenry the Navigator's exploration program has royal priority\n\nAtlantic trade routes remain Portugal's economic lifeline—fleet maintenance is essential\n\nLagos shipyards active under Henry's direction\n\nLisbon has established shipbuilding traditions\n\nFactors Creating Risk:\n\nTangier disaster (1437) depleted military resources and morale\n\nPrince Ferdinand remains hostage—political crisis ongoing\n\nKing Duarte's health declining (historically dies September 1438)\n\nPortugal is a small kingdom with limited resources\n\nCeuta garrison requires constant resupply—strains patrol fleet\n\nHenry's exploration absorbs significant naval resources\n\nAtlantic weather is harsh on vessels\n\nHistorical Context:\n\n1415 Ceuta expedition: 59 galleys, 33 carracks, 120 smaller vessels (extraordinary mobilization)\n\nNormal Portuguese royal fleet: 15-25 war galleys, 10-20 ocean-going vessels\n\nHenry's exploration fleet: 10-15 caravels of varying sizes\n\nTrade fleet is largely private, but Crown has some vessels and can requisition others\n\nd100 Table:\n\nRoll\nTrade Fleet\nPatrol/Defense\nExploration\nOverall Assessment\n1-5\nCrisis — Atlantic storms devastated trade routes. 3-5 royal trade vessels operational. Merchant fleet badly depleted.\nCollapse — Tangier aftermath stripped patrol capacity. 4-6 galleys, most in poor repair. Ceuta resupply endangered.\nStalled — Henry's program gutted for Tangier. 3-5 caravels remain. Exploration halted.\nDisaster — Portuguese maritime capacity crippled. Union with Castile now essential for survival.\n6-15\nStruggling — Trade routes maintained but vessels aging. 6-8 royal trade vessels. Profits declining.\nWeakened — Tangier losses not replaced. 6-8 galleys operational. Ceuta support strained.\nReduced — Henry lost vessels to Tangier support. 5-8 caravels. Exploration slowed.\nTroubled — Fleet at 50-60% of potential. Heavy reliance on Castilian partnership.\n16-35\nAdequate — Trade continues normally. 8-10 royal vessels. Private fleet supplements.\nMaintained — Basic patrol capability intact. 8-10 galleys operational. Ceuta secure.\nContinuing — Henry's program persists despite setbacks. 8-10 caravels. African coast exploration ongoing.\nModest — Fleet at 65-75% capacity. Functional but not expanding.\n36-60\nStable — Trade fleet in good order. 10-12 royal vessels. Atlantic routes profitable.\nSolid — Patrol fleet competent. 10-12 galleys operational. Barbary threat managed.\nProgressing — Henry's fleet growing. 10-12 caravels. African exploration advancing steadily.\nAdequate — Fleet at 75-85% capacity. Meeting obligations.\n61-80\nProsperous — Trade expanding. 12-15 royal vessels. New construction underway. English and Flemish routes thriving.\nStrong — Patrol fleet confident. 12-14 galleys. Corsairs suppressed. Ceuta well-supplied.\nFlourishing — Henry's program thriving. 12-15 caravels. African coast mapped extensively. Arguim outpost supported.\nGood — Fleet at 85-95% capacity. Castilian gold making difference.\n81-95\nThriving — Major trade expansion. 15-18 royal vessels. New markets developing.\nExcellent — Patrol dominance established. 14-16 galleys. Western Mediterranean secure.\nAmbitious — Henry expanding rapidly. 15-18 caravels. Gold Coast within reach. Major discoveries imminent.\nExcellent — Fleet exceeding expectations. Portuguese-Castilian union bearing fruit.\n96-100\nExceptional — Trade fleet transformed. 18-20+ royal vessels. Portugal becoming Atlantic commercial power.\nFormidable — Patrol fleet expanded. 16-18 galleys. Morocco coast dominated.\nRevolutionary — Henry's fleet unprecedented. 18-20+ caravels. Guinea reached. Gold flowing.\nRemarkable — Portuguese maritime power at historic peak. Castilian investment transformed the kingdom.\n\nPlease roll d100.",

Sultan Murad II is cautious but would logically be expanding his fleet in preparation for potential conflict after the truce expires (1445).\n\nThe truce started in 1435, so it's been 3 years. Murad would have had time to observe and respond.\n\nFactors to consider:\n- Gallipoli shipyard is functional\n- Ottoman naval quality is inferior to Venetian/Genoese\n- Ottomans are primarily a land power\n- They have Greek and Italian expertise available\n- Murad II is known as cautious and methodical\n- The threat from Juan's alliance would motivate expansion\n- But expansion takes time and resources\n- Ottoman focus remains on land power (Janissaries, sipahis)\n\nLet me draft a table that accounts for both the baseline Ottoman fleet AND their expansion in response to the Christian threat.\n\nChaos Roll: Ottoman Imperial Fleet Status (January 1438)\n\nThis roll determines the state of Sultan Murad II's naval forces. Critical context: The Ottomans are primarily a land power. Their navy exists to support army crossings, blockade ports during sieges, and control the Straits—not to contest the open Mediterranean against Venice or Genoa.\n\nHowever, Sultan Murad II is aware of the Christian alliance forming against him. The truce signed at Tenedos (1435) runs until 1445, giving him time to prepare. The question is: how aggressively has he invested in naval expansion?\n\nHistorical Baseline (1430s):\n\nGallipoli shipyard established 1390, remains primary naval base\n\nOttoman fleet destroyed by Venetians at Gallipoli (1416/1426)\n\n1430 siege of Thessaloniki: Ottoman fleet participated in combined operations\n\nNormal Ottoman fleet: 40-60 vessels (mostly galiots and small galleys)\n\nOttoman ships considered inferior quality to Western vessels\n\nCrews include Greek and Italian expertise, but seamanship lags behind Venice\n\nRelevant Factors:\n\nFactors Favoring Expansion:\n\nMurad II is methodical and foresighted—he would recognize the threat\n\nThree years since Tenedos to observe and prepare\n\nGallipoli shipyard is functional with experienced shipwrights\n\nGreek coastal populations provide experienced sailors\n\nJuan's buildup is not secret—Ottoman spies would report it\n\nTimber available from Anatolian forests\n\nJanissary corps and land forces are strong, freeing resources for naval investment\n\nFactors Limiting Expansion:\n\nOttoman strategic culture prioritizes land power\n\nNaval construction is expensive and slow\n\nQuality gap with Western fleets is difficult to close\n\nKaraman and other eastern threats divide Ottoman attention\n\nBalkans require ongoing military presence\n\nMurad's cautious nature—may prefer to wait and see\n\nOttoman treasury has limits\n\nd100 Table:\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-5\nNeglect — Murad focused entirely on land power. Fleet at 1420s level: 30-40 vessels, mostly small galiots. No significant expansion. Gallipoli shipyard doing maintenance only.\n6-15\nMinimal Response — Murad observed but did not prioritize naval expansion. Fleet at 45-55 vessels. Minor repairs and replacements. No new construction program.\n16-30\nCautious Preparation — Murad ordered modest expansion. Fleet at 55-70 vessels. Some new galleys built. Gallipoli moderately active. Preparing for contingency, not war.\n31-50\nMethodical Buildup — Murad recognized the threat and responded systematically. Fleet at 70-85 vessels. New construction program underway. Quality improving. Crews training.\n51-70\nSerious Investment — Murad prioritized naval expansion. Fleet at 85-100 vessels. Gallipoli at full capacity. Greek shipwrights recruited. Stockpiling naval stores. Fleet could contest coastal waters.\n71-85\nMajor Expansion — Murad made naval power a strategic priority. Fleet at 100-120 vessels. Multiple shipyards active. Quality approaching Western standards. Experienced admirals appointed.\n86-95\nAggressive Buildup — Murad preparing for inevitable conflict. Fleet at 120-140 vessels. New shipyard construction. Recruiting Italian expertise. Fleet could challenge Christian coalition in Aegean.\n96-100\nTransformation — Murad transformed Ottoman naval capacity. Fleet at 140+ vessels (approaching 1453 levels early). Multiple shipyards, trained crews, artillery-equipped galleys. Ottoman naval power now a serious Mediterranean factor.\n\nPlease roll d100.",

The advisors present are:\n- Diego de Daza (finances/administration)\n- Captain Fernán (naval commander, knows Eastern waters)\n- Isaac de Baeza (intelligence network)\n\nÁlvaro de Luna is also present.\n\nLet me have them discuss the situation realistically, presenting the numbers based on the rolls, and then waiting for Juan to respond about future shipbuilding.\n\nDiego de Daza spreads his ledgers across the table, his quill tapping against the margins as he organizes his thoughts. Captain Fernán leans forward, weathered hands clasped. A page is dispatched to summon Isaac de Baeza from elsewhere in the city.\n\nDiego de Daza clears his throat and begins:\n\n\"Your Majesty, I must report that Admiral Vilaragut's projections have not been fully met. We stand at approximately ninety-two percent of the April 1435 plan.\"\n\nHe runs his finger down the columns.\n\n\"The royal fleet numbers one hundred vessels, not the projected one hundred and eight. We lost two naos to a storm off Sardinia last autumn—the Santa Clara and the San Bartolomé, both with full crews. A third carrack, the Esperanza, has been in extended refit at La Cartuja since September. Rot in the keel timbers—she was one of the used vessels we purchased from Genoa in '35. The Genoese, it seems, sold us their problems.\"\n\nHe produces a summary sheet:\n\nCASTILIAN ROYAL FLEET — January 1438\n\nType\nProjected\nActual\nNotes\nCarracks\n20\n18\nOne in refit, one lost\nNaos\n25\n22\nTwo lost to storm\nGalleys\n13\n13\nOn target\nFishing/Utility\n36\n33\nMinor shortfall\nPatrol Craft\n14\n14\nOn target\nTOTAL\n108\n100\n92%\n\n\"The Military Orders have exceeded expectations, however. Twenty-nine vessels at Almería—the Masters invested heavily from their own revenues. Santiago alone fields eleven war galleys now.\"\n\nCaptain Fernán picks up the thread:\n\n\"The shipyards are performing well, Your Majesty. La Cartuja is at full capacity—six vessels launched last year, another eight on the stocks. The Basque contracts are reliable. The problem is not construction but attrition. The Mediterranean eats ships. Storms, worms, rot, corsair action. We must build faster than we lose.\"\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\"The good news: our crews are experienced now. Three years of Constantinople convoys have made sailors of farmers. The men know the Eastern waters—the currents, the anchorages, the weather patterns. That cannot be bought.\"\n\nA knock at the door. Isaac de Baeza enters, his dark robes rustling. The Jewish spymaster bows and takes the seat Álvaro indicates.\n\n\"Your Majesty summoned me regarding Ottoman matters?\"\n\nAt your nod, he produces a folded document from his sleeve.\n\n\"My correspondents in Constantinople, Galata, and Rhodes report consistently. The Sultan has not been idle these three years.\"\n\nHe unfolds what appears to be a summary of reports:\n\n\"Gallipoli shipyard operates at full capacity. New construction—not merely repairs. My man in Pera counts hulls: he estimates eighty-five to one hundred vessels now, perhaps more in the Black Sea yards we cannot observe. The Sultan has recruited Greek shipwrights from the Aegean islands—men who know Western construction methods. He stockpiles timber, pitch, hemp, and iron. Naval stores sufficient for a major campaign.\"\n\nIsaac's dark eyes meet yours.\n\n\"Sultan Murad is methodical, Your Majesty. He does not rush. But he prepares. The truce runs seven more years, and he intends to be ready when it expires. Or sooner, if opportunity presents.\"\n\nDiego interjects: \"And the other crowns, Your Majesty? You asked for a complete accounting.\"\n\nHe produces additional sheets:\n\nARAGONESE ROYAL FLEET — January 1438\n\"I have Admiral Vilaragut's correspondence with the Barcelona Drassanes.

King Alfonso saw no need for a separate Neapolitan navy when he commanded the Aragonese fleet. The Angevin vessels he inherited have largely rotted at anchor. Five to eight galleys remain, and those in poor repair. The Castellammare yards are idle.\"\n\nCaptain Fernán snorts. \"Naples is a liability, not an asset. We cannot count on them for anything beyond harbor defense—and barely that.\"\n\nPORTUGUESE FLEET — January 1438\n\"King Duarte's fleet is adequate,\" Diego continues. \"The maritime union functions as agreed.

But...\"\n\nCaptain Fernán leans back, arms crossed.\n\n\"Paper means nothing, Your Majesty. Our fleet is scattered across three seas. The Castilian ships are in Seville and the Atlantic. The Aragonese are in Barcelona and Sicily. The Portuguese guard Ceuta and explore Africa. To concentrate against the Sultan, we must move everything east—and that takes months.\"\n\n\"The Ottomans,\" he continues, \"are concentrated at Gallipoli. One hundred ships, one harbor, one admiral. They can sortie in days. And they fight in their own waters, near their own supplies, with short lines of communication.\"\n\nHe shakes his head.\n\n\"Numbers favor us. Geography favors them.\"\n\nIsaac de Baeza adds quietly:\n\n\"There is another consideration, Your Majesty. Ottoman ships are inferior to ours in open water—lighter, less seaworthy, crews less experienced in fleet actions. But in the narrow waters of the Straits, the Aegean islands, the approaches to Constantinople? Their galleys are fast and maneuverable. They know every cove and current.\"\n\n\"And the Sultan can replace losses faster than we can. Gallipoli can launch a galley in weeks. La Cartuja requires months. If this becomes a war of attrition...\"\n\nHe leaves the thought unfinished.\n\nDon Álvaro de Luna, who has been listening silently, speaks at last:\n\n\"The question before Your Majesty is not whether we can defeat the Ottoman fleet—we can, if we concentrate and fight on our terms. The question is what we wish to achieve, and at what cost.\"\n\nHe steeples his fingers.\n\n\"Do we build to maintain superiority? To achieve dominance? To threaten the Sultan into extending the truce? Each answer implies a different shipbuilding program.\"\n\nHe gestures to Diego's papers.\n\n\"Admiral Vilaragut's original plan projected one hundred forty-three royal vessels by 1440. We are behind schedule. Do we accelerate? Maintain current pace? Or redirect resources elsewhere?\"\n\nThe men fall silent, awaiting your direction.",

In Chapter 2.34, there's a detailed Constantinople naval reconstruction plan:\n\n**Phase One – Foundation (1435-1436): ~30,000 florins**\n- Repair three slipways: 8,000 florins\n- Restore rope walks and sail lofts: 3,000 florins\n- Gather tools: 500 florins\n- Recruit 100 apprentices: 4,000 florins/year\n- Import timber (Morea, Venetian sources): 12,000 florins\n- Hire Venetian master shipwrights: 2,000 florins/year\n\n**Phase Two – Construction (1437-1440):**\n| Year | Vessels | Notes |\n|------|---------|-------|\n| 1437 | 2 | First new construction in a decade |\n| 1438 | 3 | Workforce expanding |\n| 1439 | 4 | Full production beginning |\n| 1440 | 5-6 | Sustainable output reached |\n\n**Projected Fleet by 1440:** 12-15 imperial vessels\n\nSo the plan was approved in March 1435, with 30,000 florins invested. Now it's January 1438, so we're about 3 years into the plan. The projection was:\n- 1437: 2 vessels\n- 1438: 3 vessels\n\nSo by now they should theoretically have 2 vessels completed and possibly working on 3 more. But this needs a chaos roll to determine how the program has actually progressed.\n\nI need to draft a d100 table for the Constantinople/Byzantine fleet development program.\n\nI found the details. In March 1435, you approved a 30,000 florin shipyard reconstruction program at the Neorion in Constantinople, with Sphrantzes overseeing the work.\n\nDiego de Daza shuffles through his papers, pulling out correspondence bearing Byzantine seals.\n\n\"Ah, yes—the Neorion reconstruction. Sphrantzes sends quarterly reports through the settler convoys.\"\n\nHe finds the relevant document.\n\n\"The plan projected two vessels completed by end of 1437, with three more in 1438, scaling to five or six annually by 1440. Total fleet of twelve to fifteen imperial vessels by decade's end.\"\n\nHe pauses, scanning the figures.\n\n\"But Your Majesty, I have only the reports—not the reality. The eastern Mediterranean is... unpredictable. Sphrantzes writes optimistically, but he always writes optimistically. The question is whether the Neorion has actually delivered.\"\n\nChaos Roll: Constantinople Fleet Development (1435-1438)\n\nThis roll determines how the Byzantine shipyard reconstruction and construction program has actually progressed since Juan's 30,000 florin investment in March 1435.\n\nRelevant Factors:\n\nFactors Favoring Success:\n\nSubstantial funding (30,000 florins—more than Constantinople has seen in decades)\n\nSphrantzes is competent and motivated administrator\n\n62 skilled workers identified at program start\n\nVenetian master shipwrights hired\n\nTimber imports from Morea and Venetian sources arranged\n\nLatin settlers include experienced craftsmen\n\nThree years is sufficient time for initial results\n\nFactors Creating Risk:\n\nByzantine administration has been dysfunctional for generations\n\nSkilled workforce is elderly or inexperienced\n\nOttoman pressure may have disrupted timber supplies\n\nRefugee housing in sail lofts must be relocated—social friction\n\nCorruption is endemic in Constantinople\n\nItalian merchants may sabotage competition\n\nNotaras faction sympathizers may still be present\n\nNo Byzantine ship construction in over a decade—institutional knowledge lost\n\nd100 Table:\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-5\nFailure — Corruption, sabotage, or disaster. Funds embezzled or wasted. Shipyard fire or structural collapse. 0-1 vessels completed. Program must restart.\n6-15\nSerious Problems — Major delays and cost overruns. Venetian shipwrights departed over payment disputes. Workforce scattered. 1 vessel completed, poor quality. Program salvageable but needs intervention.\n16-30\nBelow Expectations — Persistent difficulties. Timber supplies inconsistent, apprentice training slow. 2 vessels completed but behind schedule. 1438 production uncertain.\n31-50\nModest Progress — Program functioning but not thriving. 2 vessels completed on schedule. 1438 production beginning (1-2 on stocks). Workforce growing slowly. Sphrantzes managing but stretched thin.\n51-70\nOn Target — Plan executed as projected. 2 vessels completed 1437, 2-3 under construction for 1438. Apprentices training well. Venetian masters satisfied. Constantinople has a functioning shipyard again.\n71-85\nExceeding Expectations — Program thriving. 3 vessels completed (ahead of schedule). 3-4 under construction. Latin settlers contributing expertise. Greek shipwrights regaining confidence. Morale high.\n86-95\nExceptional Success — Sphrantzes exceeded all projections. 4 vessels completed. Full 1438 production underway. Additional slipways repaired. Workforce doubled. Constantinople becoming a shipbuilding center again.\n96-100\nRemarkable Achievement — Beyond reasonable expectation. 5+ vessels completed. Neorion at full historical capacity. Greek maritime pride restored. Venetian and Genoese merchants taking notice. Fleet ahead of 1440 projections.\n\nPlease roll d100.",

      "text": "**Castilian Fleet (Roll 38 - 92% of projection):**\n- Carracks: 18 (projected 20, minus 1 lost, 1 in refit)\n- Naos: 22 (projected 25, minus 2 lost to storm)\n- Galleys: 13 (on target)\n- Fishing/Utility: 33\n- Patrol: 14\n- Total: 100\n\nFor war purposes, we count carracks and galleys. Naos can fight but are primarily transport/cargo vessels. Let me think about what counts as a \"warship\":\n- Carracks: Heavy warships, high-sided, can carry cannons, excellent against galleys\n- War Galleys: Traditional Mediterranean warships, oar-powered, good in confined waters\n- Naos: Can be armed but primarily cargo vessels - semi-warships\n\n**Military Orders (29 vessels):**\nFrom the summaries, Santiago has 11 galleys, Calatrava has galleys + naos + transports, Alcántara has galleys.\nLooking at the 1438 projection from the naval plan:\n- Santiago: 11 galleys\n- Calatrava: 6 galleys + 4 naos + 2 transports\n- Alcántara: 5 galleys\nTotal: 22 galleys + 4 naos + 2 transports = 28 vessels (close to 29)\n\nSo Military Orders war galleys: ~22\n\n**Aragonese Fleet (Roll 68 - Good Condition):**\n- Royal Galleys (Catalonia): 23-25\n- Sicilian Squadron: 8\n- Sardinian Squadron: 5\n- Total: 36-38 galleys\n\nThese are all war galleys - Aragon's Mediterranean fleet is galley-based.\n \n**Neapolitan Fleet (Roll 11 - Minimal):**\nI note the Neapolitan naval contribution is extremely limited. With only 5-8 galleys in poor condition, they provide minimal military support. Their fleet is essentially inconsequential for major naval engagements.\n\n**Portuguese Fleet (Roll 40 - Adequate/Stable):**\nPortugal's naval assets are diverse but not fully optimized for Mediterranean warfare. Their 10-12 patrol galleys represent the most relevant force for potential conflict. Trade vessels and exploration ships, while important, won't directly impact naval combat in the Mediterranean theater.\n\nThe Mediterranean operational capacity looks slim. Perhaps 8-10 galleys could be mobilized if urgent military needs arise. Their Atlantic-oriented fleet means limited immediate Mediterranean deployment potential.\n\n**Constantinople Fleet (Roll 45 - Modest Progress):**\nByzantine naval strength appears fragile. With just 2 operational vessels in 1437 and potentially 1-2 more under construction, their maritime capabilities are severely constrained. These would likely be traditional Greek-style galleys, representing a minimal defensive presence.\n\n**Ottoman Fleet (Roll 70 - Serious Investment):**\nThe Ottoman naval power stands in stark contrast to other regional fleets. Boasting 85-100 vessels, their maritime strength is formidable. The fleet composition reveals strategic depth:\n- 30-40 war galleys (kadirga) provide heavy combat potential\n- 40-50 galiots offer speed and supplementary tactical flexibility\n- Remaining vessels ensure logistical and support capabilities\n\nThe Ottoman maritime investment demonstrates a comprehensive approach to naval warfare, significantly outmatching Christian coalition naval resources.\n\n**CHRISTIAN COALITION WARSHIPS:**\nHeavy warships like Castilian and Portuguese carracks total approximately 22-23 vessels. War galleys present a more distributed picture:\n- Castile's royal and military order fleets contribute 35 galleys\n- Aragon adds 36-38 vessels\n- Naples provides 5-8 (though in questionable condition)\n- Portugal potentially offers 8-10\n- Constantinople's minimal 2 vessels\n\nTotal Christian naval assets hover around 108-116 warships.\n\n**OTTOMAN WARSHIPS:**\nTheir fleet comprises 70-90 vessels, with a strategic concentration at Gallipoli. The key distinctions are clear: Christians possess high-sided carracks effective in open water, while Ottomans leverage numerous, lighter vessels with superior tactical mobility.\n\nDiego de Daza pulls out fresh paper and begins calculating, conferring quietly with Captain Fernán over the classifications.\n\n\"Your Majesty asks the right question. For a naval engagement, we must distinguish between ships that fight and ships that carry.\"\n\nHe draws two columns.\n\nCaptain Fernán takes over the explanation:\n\n\"Carracks are our heavy warships—high-sided, can mount cannons, crews fight from above. A carrack can defeat multiple galleys in open water because the galleys cannot board her. The Genoese learned this at Ponza when they smashed King Alfonso's fleet—their carracks against his galleys.\"\n\n\"War galleys are the traditional Mediterranean warship—fast, maneuverable, oar-powered. They can fight in confined waters where carracks cannot maneuver. They ram, they board, they swarm. In the Straits or among islands, galleys are deadly.\"\n\n\"Naos, patrol craft, fishing vessels—these can be armed, but they are not warships. They carry soldiers, supplies, settlers. In battle, they stay behind the line.\"\n\nDiego completes his calculations:\n\nCHRISTIAN COALITION WARSHIPS — January 1438\n\nHeavy Warships (Carracks)\n\nSource\nCarracks\nNotes\nCastile Royal\n18\n1 in refit, 1 lost\nPortugal (if summoned)\n4-5\nAtlantic trade vessels\nTOTAL CARRACKS\n22-23\nHigh-sided, cannon-armed\n\nWar Galleys\n\nSource\nGalleys\nCondition\nNotes\nCastile Royal\n13\nGood\nExperienced crews\nCastile Military Orders\n22\nGood\nSantiago 11, Calatrava 6, Alcántara 5\nAragon Royal\n23-25\nGood\nBarcelona Drassanes quality\nAragon Sicily\n8\nGood\nExperienced in Eastern waters\nAragon Sardinia\n5\nGood\nPatrol duty\nNaples\n5-8\nPoor\nBarely seaworthy\nPortugal (if summoned)\n8-10\nAdequate\nCeuta patrol fleet\nConstantinople\n2\nNew\nNeorion construction\nTOTAL GALLEYS\n86-95\nMixed\n~80 reliable\n\nCombined Christian Warships\n\nType\nCount\nNotes\nCarracks\n22-23\nDominant in open water\nWar Galleys\n86-95\n~80 reliable quality\nTOTAL WARSHIPS\n108-118\nScattered across three seas\n\nIsaac de Baeza produces his own notes on the Ottoman fleet:\n\nOTTOMAN IMPERIAL FLEET — January 1438\n\n\"The Sultan's fleet is organized differently, Your Majesty. He has no carracks—the Ottomans have not adopted Western heavy ship construction. His strength is in galleys and their lighter cousins.\"\n\nType\nCount\nDescription\nWar Galleys (kadirga)\n35-40\nFull-sized Mediterranean galleys\nGaliots (kalyata/fusta)\n45-55\nLighter, faster, 30-50 oars\nTOTAL WARSHIPS\n80-95\nConcentrated at Gallipoli\n\n\"The galiots are not true war galleys—they are smaller, carry fewer fighters, cannot stand against a proper galley in a boarding action. But they are fast. In a chase, in a raid, in swarming a becalmed ship, they are deadly. And the Sultan has many of them.\"\n\nCaptain Fernán summarizes the comparison:\n\nFLEET COMPARISON\n\nFactor\nChristian Coalition\nOttoman Empire\nCarracks\n22-23\n0\nWar Galleys\n80-85 (reliable)\n35-40\nGaliots/Light Vessels\n—\n45-55\nTotal Warships\n~105\n~85\n\nQualitative Assessment\n\n\"On paper, we have the advantage,\" Fernán says. \"Twenty-two carracks alone could devastate an Ottoman galley fleet in open water. Our galleys outnumber his true war galleys two-to-one.\"\n\nHe raises a cautionary hand.\n\n\"But.\"\n\n\"First—our fleet is scattered. The Castilian ships are at Seville. The Aragonese are at Barcelona and Messina. The Portuguese guard Ceuta. To concentrate against the Sultan requires months of movement through waters he can observe.\"\n\n\"Second—the Sultan's fleet is concentrated. Eighty-five ships at Gallipoli, one harbor, one command. He can sortie in days.\"\n\n\"Third—geography. In open water, our carracks are invincible. But the approaches to Constantinople are not open water. The Dardanelles are narrow. The Sea of Marmara is confined. The Bosphorus is a channel. In those waters, his galiots can swarm, his galleys can maneuver, and our carracks become floating fortresses that cannot bring their strength to bear.\"\n\n\"Fourth—attrition. The Sultan can build a galiot in weeks. We require months for a carrack. If this becomes a grinding war, he replaces losses faster than we do.\"\n\nIsaac de Baeza adds quietly:\n\n\"There is a fifth consideration, Your Majesty. The Sultan has not yet committed to war. His buildup is preparation, not mobilization. If he believes conflict is inevitable, he will accelerate. Gallipoli can produce ten galleys a year in peacetime. In wartime, with full resources committed? Twenty. Thirty. The fleet Your Majesty faces in 1445 may be twice what it is today.\"\n\nDon Álvaro de Luna steeples his fingers:\n\n\"So the question becomes: do we seek battle before the Sultan is ready? Do we build faster to maintain our advantage? Or do we use our current superiority as leverage to extend the truce and buy more time?\"\n\nHe looks to you.\n\n\"What is Your Majesty's strategic intent?\"",

      "text": "Constantinople had several harbors:\n1. The Golden Horn - the main harbor, protected by a chain\n2. The Prosphorion/Neorion harbors on the Golden Horn\n3. Various smaller harbors on the Sea of Marmara side\n\nThe Golden Horn was one of the great natural harbors of the ancient world. It could hold hundreds of ships. But by the 1430s, Constantinople was in decline - the harbors may be silted, facilities degraded, etc.\n\nI should research this and then potentially create a chaos roll for the current state of Constantinople's harbor facilities, or at least provide a realistic assessment based on historical data.\n\nLet me search for information about Constantinople's harbor capacity.\n\nCaptain Fernán leans forward, his weathered face intent.\n\n\"Now Your Majesty thinks like an admiral.\"\n\nHe traces an imaginary map on the table.\n\n\"Constantinople has one of the finest natural harbors in the world—the Golden Horn. In the days of Justinian, a thousand ships could shelter there. The chain across the mouth kept enemies out while the fleet rested safe within.\"\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\"But that was eight hundred years ago.\"\n\nWeb Search: Constantinople Golden Horn harbor capacity medieval ships facilities 1400s Byzantine\n\nGolden Horn - Wikipedia wikipedia.org\n\nHarbours and shipbuilding in Byzantine Constantinople - The Sea in History - The Medieval World cambridge.org\n\nHarboring history: Istanbul's Golden Horn | Daily Sabah dailysabah.com\n\nA journey through constantinople - GOLDEN HORN google.com\n\nGreat Chain of The Golden Horn: Constantinople’s Impenetrable Barrier | Ancient Origins ancient-origins.net\n\nGolden Horn Chain - Atlas Obscura atlasobscura.com\n\nHarbour of Eleutherios - Wikipedia wikipedia.org\n\nThe Golden Horn: Istanbul's Historic Harbor - The Other Tour theothertour.com\n\nSea Walls of Constantinople thebyzantinelegacy.com\n\nThe Golden Horn of Istanbul - Istanbul Insider - theistanbulinsider.com\n\nGood research on the Golden Horn. Key points:\n- 7.5 km long, 750 meters wide at widest\n- Deep natural harbor (35 meters at entrance)\n- No tides or currents - very calm waters\n- Protected by chain across entrance\n- Byzantine naval headquarters located there\n- Two major harbors on Golden Horn: Neorion and Prosphorion\n- These harbors gradually silted up over medieval era\n- Italian maritime republics (Venice, Genoa) had concessions in these harbors before Fourth Crusade\n\nSo the issue is that by the 1430s, the harbors have been partially silting up, and the Genoese control Galata across the water. The capacity is still huge theoretically, but the actual facilities (wharves, warehouses, dry docks, etc.) are in decay.\n\nLet me think about realistic harbor capacity:\n- The Golden Horn itself could hold hundreds of ships at anchor\n- But mooring at quays, accessing supplies, performing repairs - that requires facilities\n- The Neorion (where the shipyard is) has limited capacity for the actual shipyard\n- Galata across the water is Genoese-controlled\n\nI should present this in narrative form - Captain Fernán and the others discussing the practical realities of basing a fleet at Constantinople.\n\nCaptain Fernán exchanges a glance with Diego, then speaks carefully.\n\n\"The Golden Horn itself, Your Majesty? It could shelter five hundred ships at anchor. Seven and a half kilometers long, calm waters, no tides or currents. The chain across the mouth keeps enemies out. As a refuge, it is unmatched.\"\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\"But anchoring is not basing. A fleet needs wharves for provisioning. Warehouses for naval stores—rope, canvas, tar, timber. Fresh water sources. Repair facilities. Dry docks for hull maintenance. Barracks for crews when ships are laid up for winter.\"\n\nDiego de Daza pulls out Sphrantzes' reports.\n\n\"The Neorion—where our 30,000 florins went—has five slipways. Three are now functional. That is capacity to build perhaps four to six vessels at a time, and repair perhaps the same. But for basing an operational fleet...\"\n\nHe shakes his head.\n\n\"The old Byzantine harbors—the Neorion and Prosphorion on the Golden Horn, the Harbor of Theodosius on the Marmara—were built for hundreds of ships. But they have silted up over centuries. The Italians hold the best remaining facilities. Galata across the water is Genoese. The Venetian quarter has its own wharves.\"\n\nIsaac de Baeza adds quietly:\n\n\"There is also the matter of supply lines, Your Majesty. A fleet at Constantinople is inside the Ottoman sphere. Every barrel of salt pork, every coil of rope, every replacement timber must come by sea—through waters the Sultan can threaten. Gallipoli sits at the entrance to the Dardanelles. Any supply convoy must pass within sight of Ottoman guns.\"\n\nCaptain Fernán summarizes:\n\n\"If Your Majesty wishes to base a fleet at Constantinople, we must think in stages.\"\n\nHe counts on his weathered fingers:\n\n\"First—what can we do now, with existing facilities? The Golden Horn can anchor perhaps thirty to forty warships comfortably with current wharfage, plus the Neorion's repair capacity. More ships can anchor in the harbor, but without proper facilities they cannot be maintained. Crews rot from idleness, hulls foul, stores spoil.\"\n\n\"Second—what could we achieve with investment? Dredge the silted harbors. Build new wharves. Expand the Neorion. Construct warehouses. With perhaps 50,000 to 80,000 florins over three to five years, we could create facilities for sixty to eighty warships with full support.\"\n\n\"Third—what is the maximum the Golden Horn could support if we rebuilt it to Byzantine glory? In theory, one hundred fifty to two hundred warships. But that would require years of work, hundreds of thousands of florins, and—most critically—control of the supply lines.\"\n\nDon Álvaro de Luna strokes his chin.\n\n\"So the question becomes circular. To base a large fleet at Constantinople, we need secure supply lines. To secure supply lines, we need to control the Dardanelles. To control the Dardanelles, we need a large fleet based close enough to contest them.\"\n\nHe looks at you.\n\n\"Currently, Your Majesty could station thirty to forty warships at Constantinople with existing facilities. That is enough to defend the city from naval assault—the chain and those ships together would stop any Ottoman fleet. But it is not enough to project power into the Aegean or contest the Straits offensively.\"\n\nCaptain Fernán adds one final consideration:\n\n\"There is also the matter of crew sustainability, Your Majesty. Mediterranean fleets do not stay at sea year-round. Galleys especially—they need to beach for winter, crews need shore leave, ships need maintenance. If we base forty galleys at Constantinople, we need housing and provisions for eight to ten thousand sailors and marines through the winter months. Constantinople's population is perhaps forty thousand. We would be adding a quarter to the city's mouths to feed.\"\n\nHe spreads his hands.\n\n\"It can be done. But it requires planning, investment, and—above all—reliable supply convoys that the Sultan cannot interdict.\"\n\nThe men fall silent, awaiting your response.\n\nCurrent Assessment:\n\nBasing Capacity\nShips\nRequirements\nImmediate (existing facilities)\n30-40 warships\nMinimal additional investment\nMedium-term (with 50-80k florins investment)\n60-80 warships\n3-5 years development\nMaximum (full reconstruction)\n150-200 warships\nMajor investment, years of work, secure supply lines",

And we do not have a fleet of 200 ships anyway.

I also want to know how many soldiers in an army we can ship over in one trip using the entire fleet, provided we have time to prepare this move.

      "text": "For Constantinople's population:\n- Started at ~40,000 in 1434\n- Settlers arriving since Spring 1435\n- Chapter summaries mention projections of 3,000-5,000 settlers annually initially, growing over time\n- By January 1438, that's roughly 3 years of settlement\n- If 10,000+ per year as the user says, that's 30,000+ additional people\n- So population could be 70,000+ now\n\nFor troop transport capacity:\nI need to look at the naval plan documents to see what they say about emergency lift capacity. The Royal Naval Development Plan mentioned emergency lift figures.\n\nFrom the search results earlier:\n- 1435: Emergency Lift 7,865\n- 1436: Emergency Lift 10,155\n- 1437: Emergency Lift 13,780\n- 1438: Emergency Lift 17,825\n- 1439: Emergency Lift 21,055\n- 1440: Emergency Lift 24,110\n\nBut these are Castilian fleet numbers. We need to add the other fleets (Aragon, Portugal, Naples, Constantinople).\n\nLet me calculate the troop capacity for the combined fleet.\n\nHistorical context: A galley could carry about 100-150 soldiers in addition to rowers for short trips. \n\nLarge vessels offer significantly more troop transport potential. A carrack provides substantial capacity, able to move 200-400 soldiers depending on its specific design and configuration. Naos present another viable option, typically transporting between 100-200 troops per vessel.\n\nDiego de Daza flushes slightly at the correction.\n\n\"Your Majesty is right, of course. I was thinking of the city as it was when you first arrived. Forgive me.\"\n\nHe pulls out another ledger—the settler convoy records.\n\n\"The convoys have delivered... let me see... approximately twelve thousand settlers in 1435, another fourteen thousand in 1436, and sixteen thousand in 1437. With natural growth and the Latin merchants who have arrived independently...\"\n\nHe calculates quickly.\n\n\"Constantinople's population now approaches eighty to ninety thousand, and growing. More than double what it was four years ago. The city can certainly support a fleet's crews through winter.\"\n\nCaptain Fernán nods approvingly at your strategic thinking.\n\n\"Your Majesty grasps the essential point. The fleet serves two purposes: sustaining the Eastern position through regular convoys, and winning a war through concentrated military deployment. These require different calculations.\"\n\nHe takes a fresh sheet of paper.\n\n\"Let me work through the numbers for a full military lift—every ship committed to moving soldiers, not settlers.\"\n\nTROOP TRANSPORT CAPACITY\n\nFernán explains the methodology:\n\n\"For settlers, we calculate families with belongings, livestock, tools, grain for the first season. A carrack that carries sixty settlers with all their goods can carry two hundred to two hundred fifty soldiers with weapons and supplies for a campaign—they need less space per man, and we pack them tight for a short voyage.\"\n\n\"Galleys are different.

A full war footing.\"\n\n\"The voyage itself takes six to eight weeks from Seville to Constantinople, depending on weather and whether we stop at Sicily for provisioning. The fleet could make one major lift per sailing season—depart in April, arrive in June, return by September before autumn storms.\"\n\nDiego adds the projections:\n\nPROJECTED MILITARY LIFT CAPACITY — 1438-1442\n\nYear\nCastile\nAragon\nNaples\nPortugal\nConstantinople\nTOTAL TROOPS\n1438\n14,800\n6,475\n900\n2,000\n350\n~24,500\n1439\n17,500\n6,800\n1,200\n2,200\n700\n~28,400\n1440\n20,500\n7,200\n1,500\n2,400\n1,200\n~32,800\n1441\n23,000\n7,500\n1,800\n2,600\n1,800\n~36,700\n1442\n25,500\n7,800\n2,100\n2,800\n2,500\n~40,700\n\nAssumptions: Castilian naval plan continues at current pace; Aragonese modest growth; Naples rebuilding program; Constantinople Neorion reaches full production by 1441\n\nDon Álvaro de Luna studies the figures.\n\n\"By 1440, Your Majesty could land thirty thousand soldiers in a single campaign season. By 1442, over forty thousand. Combined with the forces already stationed at Constantinople—the Military Orders, the Latin settlers of fighting age, whatever Greek troops the Emperor can muster—you could field an army of fifty thousand or more in the East.\"\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\"That is a force capable of offensive operations. Not merely defending Constantinople, but striking into Thrace. Perhaps even threatening Adrianople.\"\n\nCaptain Fernán raises a cautionary hand.\n\n\"Two considerations, Your Majesty.\"\n\n\"First—horses. Infantry we can pack tight. But cavalry requires horse transports, and horses do not travel well by sea. A carrack configured for horses carries only forty to fifty mounts instead of two hundred soldiers. If Your Majesty wishes to land heavy cavalry, the lift capacity drops significantly.\"\n\n\"Second—supplies. Twenty-five thousand soldiers need food, water, fodder, ammunition, siege equipment. Some vessels must carry supplies rather than men. A realistic combat deployment—soldiers plus the supplies to sustain a campaign—reduces the troop number by perhaps twenty percent.\"\n\nHe revises the figures:\n\nREALISTIC COMBAT DEPLOYMENT (accounting for horses and supplies)\n\nYear\nRaw Lift Capacity\nRealistic Combat Force\n1438\n24,500\n~18,000-20,000\n1440\n32,800\n~25,000-27,000\n1442\n40,700\n~32,000-35,000\n\nDiego de Daza makes a note.\n\n\"Regarding Constantinople's shipyard, Your Majesty—shall I draft orders for Sphrantzes? You wish the Neorion to focus on war galley construction going forward, and to develop wharf capacity for eighty warships?\"\n\nHe calculates quickly.\n\n\"The wharf expansion alone will require perhaps 60,000 to 80,000 florins over three to five years, as Captain Fernán estimated. Shall I prepare a formal development plan for your approval? We can include it in the next convoy's dispatches to Sphrantzes.\"\n\nThe men await your direction.",

The Christian naval assets are expanding, with significant warship capabilities across multiple squadrons. The fleet diversity includes carracks, war galleys, and specialized vessels, representing a complex maritime strategic landscape.\n\nTroop mobilization shows a progressive scaling of military potential. Raw recruitment numbers climb from 24,500 in 2438 to 40,700 by 1442, with realistic deployment figures ranging between 18,000-35,000 troops.

From 1438 to 1442, raw troop numbers escalate from around 24,500 to 40,700, with realistic deployable forces ranging between 18,000-35,000 troops. Constantinople's naval basing potential looks promising, with current capacity of 30-40 warships and potential expansion after significant financial investment.\n\nNow I'll create a comprehensive fleet document.

The Ottoman truce has seven years remaining, which provides a limited window for preparation. Our combined Christian fleet of 206 vessels, including 105 warships, stands against the Ottoman concentration of 85-100 vessels at Gallipoli. The wharf expansion in Constantinople represents a significant 80,000 florin investment, projected to take 3-5 years. Simultaneously, ongoing investments in Naples and African expeditions suggest a multi-front strategic approach, with Senegal already operational and Timbuktu results anticipated in 1439.\n\nBy 1443, our naval projection indicates a substantial increase to 305 total vessels, with 180 warships and over 35,000 troop lift capacity. Current troop deployment capabilities stand at approximately 19,500 combat-ready troops from an initial raw capacity of 24,500. The Constantinople naval base expansion will dramatically increase our maritime positioning, growing from 30-40 to 80 warships.\n\nNow let me create the chapter summary document:\n\nCreate File: Creating Chapter 2.45 Summary document\n\nThought process\n\nNow let me generate the chapter summary document.\n\nPresent File: /mnt/user-data/outputs/Chapter_2_45_Summary.docx\n\nNo location changes this chapter (all NPCs remained in Toledo)\n\nRelationship Changes\n\nNo relationship changes this chapter (administrative session with trusted advisors)\n\nStatus Changes\n\nNone this chapter\n\nNew Characters\n\nNone introduced (all NPCs were previously established)\n\nTasks\n\nSphrantzes (Constantinople): Implement 80,000 florin wharf expansion program.
