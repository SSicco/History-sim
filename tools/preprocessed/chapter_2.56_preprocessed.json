      "text": "**Current Date:** September 12, 1439, morning\n**Location:** Road departing Kraków, beginning the journey to Toledo\n**Present:** 500-man Castilian escort, 8 Polish/Hungarian knights, Father Stanisław (Polish chaplain)\n**Situation:** Just departed Kraków after successful negotiations; months-long journey ahead through Hungary, Alps, Italy, then by sea to Castile\n\nThe chapter begins exactly where Chapter 2.55 ended - Juan is on the road, having just left Kraków with his expanded party. King Władysław III personally saw them off at the city gates.\n\nI should now write the chapter introduction following the skill guidelines - brief, orienting, picking up exactly where we left off.\n\nI have all the information I need. Let me now present the chapter introduction.\n\nChapter 2.56\n\nSeptember 12th, 1439, Mid-Morning\n\nThe spires of Kraków have faded behind you now, lost in the grey haze of an autumn morning. The road stretches south through the rolling Polish countryside—fields of stubble where the harvest has passed, villages of thatch and timber, peasants pausing at their labor to watch the foreign column ride by. Five hundred Castilian lances, the crimson and gold of Trastámara snapping in the cool wind, and among them eight young knights who have never seen the Pyrenees.\n\nYoung Władysław stood at the city gates until your banner disappeared from sight—an extraordinary breach of protocol for a king to see off a departing guest so publicly. You carry with you his signed declaration to Sultan Murad, his commitment to the muster at Kraków next summer, and something perhaps more valuable: his trust. At fifteen, he has chosen you as mentor for the war that will define his reign.\n\nThe Polish chaplain Father Stanisław rides near the rear with the three Polish knights—Szafraniec, Tęczyński, and Lanckoroński. Somewhere in the column, young László Hunyadi and the Hungarian representatives from the Szilágyi and Rozgonyi families are getting their first taste of a long march under foreign command. The route ahead is clear in your mind: south through the Carpathian passes into Hungary, across the Danube, through Habsburg lands to the Alpine crossings, down into Italy, and finally—perhaps by Christmas if the weather holds—to the sea and passage home to Toledo.\n\nLucia is pregnant. The children are waiting. A kingdom—four kingdoms now—require their king's presence.",

      "text": "1. **Castile** - His original kingdom, the heartland\n2. **León** - United with Castile\n3. **Granada** - Conquered in 1432, still relatively new conquest with Muslim population\n4. **Aragon** - Inherited from Alfonso V in September 1437\n5. **Catalonia** - Part of the Crown of Aragon\n6. **Valencia** - Part of the Crown of Aragon\n7. **Naples** - Inherited from Alfonso V\n8. **Sicily** - Part of the Aragonese inheritance\n9. **Sardinia** - Part of the Aragonese inheritance\n10. **Constantinople garrison** - Not a full territory but a military presence\n\nFor each region, I should consider:\n- How long has Juan been absent?\n- What's the local political situation?\n- Are there disgruntled nobles?\n- Religious tensions?\n- Economic issues?\n- External threats?\n- Natural disasters (plague, famine, earthquake)?\n\nThis calls for creating a comprehensive chaos roll table for each region. Let me think about the specific risks:\n\n**Castile:**\n- Álvaro de Luna is managing well\n- Nobles historically dislike Luna's power\n- Juan has been generous, treasury is strong\n- Risk: Noble conspiracy against Luna, plague, famine\n\n**Granada:**\n- Only 7 years since conquest\n- Large Muslim/Morisco population\n- Some converted, some not\n- Risk: Rebellion, religious tension, former elites plotting\n\n**Aragon:**\n- Only 2 years since Juan inherited (September 1437)\n- Juan is a foreign king to them (Castilian)\n\n- The Aragonese maintain their own traditions and Cortes, so they're likely resistant to being ruled by an outsider. Catalonia presents similar challenges - it's a distinct entity with Barcelona as a major trading hub and a powerful merchant class that guards its privileges jealously. Valencia has its own complications with a mixed Christian and Mudejar population creating religious friction. Naples is even more precarious, acquired just four years ago in 1435, and Italian politics are notoriously treacherous with René of Anjou still pressing claims.\n\nThe Neapolitan nobility may resist foreign rule, and there's constant danger of Angevin plots or local uprisings. Sicily has deeper Aragonese roots so it's more stable, though baronial disputes and grain export issues remain concerns. Constantinople is the most isolated - Juan de Sotomayor's garrison is surrounded by Ottoman territory and entirely dependent on supplies and support, vulnerable to Ottoman pressure and Greek tensions.\n\nI need to build a d100 table for each region that captures the full range of outcomes, from catastrophic to fortunate. The approach should be straightforward: list the regions, identify their specific vulnerabilities, create individual tables, and have the player roll for each one. This is fundamentally a chaos mechanic - events happening outside Juan's control that will shape his political landscape.\n\nAn excellent precaution. You've been absent from your realms for months—traveling through Italy in July, negotiating in Kraków through September—and medieval kingdoms do not govern themselves. Let me compile a comprehensive list of every territory under your rule and the specific instability factors for each.\n\nREALM STABILITY ASSESSMENT — September 1439\n\nYour Domains\n\nTerritory\nYears Under Your Rule\nRegent/Governor\nKey Risk Factors\nCastile\n14 years (since minority)\nÁlvaro de Luna\nNoble resentment of Luna; plague; famine\nLeón\nUnited with Castile\nÁlvaro de Luna\nSame as Castile\nGranada\n7 years (since 1432)\nRoyal administrators\nMuslim population; former elites; religious tension\nAragon\n2 years (since 1437)\nLocal Justicia\nForeign king resentment; Cortes demands; Catalan separatism\nCatalonia\n2 years\nBarcelona oligarchs\nMerchant class grievances; autonomy demands; trade disputes\nValencia\n2 years\nLocal officials\nMudejar population; irrigation disputes; noble feuds\nNaples\n4 years (since 1435)\nViceroy (appointed?)\nAngevin plots; baronial treachery; René of Anjou watching\nSicily\n2 years\nLocal barons\nGrain export disputes; baronial feuds; distance from crown\nSardinia\n2 years\nAragonese governor\nPerennial rebellion; Genoese interference; malaria\nConstantinople\n5 years (garrison since 1434)\nJuan de Sotomayor\nOttoman probing; Greek tension; supply lines\n\nINDIVIDUAL STABILITY ROLLS\n\nI'll create a d100 table for each territory. The ranges reflect realistic medieval risks:\n\n1-10: Disaster (rebellion, plague outbreak, major conspiracy)\n\n11-25: Serious Problem (requires immediate attention)\n\n26-50: Minor Issues (manageable difficulties)\n\n51-75: Stable (no significant problems)\n\n76-90: Positive Development (unexpected good news)\n\n91-100: Windfall (exceptional opportunity or success)\n\n1. CASTILE (Core Kingdom)\n\nContext: Álvaro de Luna has governed capably for years. Treasury is strong. But the high nobility has always resented Luna's power, and a prolonged royal absence gives conspirators time to plan.\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-5\nNOBLE CONSPIRACY — Major lords have formed a league against Luna; demands for his removal or civil war\n6-10\nPLAGUE OUTBREAK — Major epidemic in one or more cities; economic disruption, deaths\n11-15\nAssassination attempt on Luna; he survives but wounded or shaken\n16-25\nNoble unrest — Grumbling, demands for Luna's authority to be curtailed, but no action yet\n26-35\nEconomic difficulties — Bad harvest, trade disruption, but treasury absorbs the shock\n36-50\nMinor disputes — Feuds between noble houses requiring arbitration\n51-75\nStable — Luna maintains order; routine administration\n76-85\nReform progress — Luna's efficiency yields additional revenue or completed projects\n86-95\nPopular support — Your crusade preparations are celebrated; public morale high\n96-100\nWINDFALL — Unexpected discovery, diplomatic success, or enemy misfortune benefits Castile\n\nRoll when ready.\n\n2. GRANADA (Conquered Territory)\n\nContext: Seven years since the conquest. Many Muslims converted (conversos/moriscos), others remain Muslim under treaty protections. Former Nasrid elites dispersed but not forgotten. The population is still adjusting to Christian rule.\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-5\nMAJOR REBELLION — Coordinated uprising in the Alpujarras; cities under siege; requires army\n6-10\nConspiracy uncovered — Network of former Nasrid loyalists planning revolt; arrests, executions\n11-20\nReligious tension — Riots between Old Christians and Moriscos; deaths, property destruction\n21-30\nEconomic strain — Silk/sugar trade disrupted; emigration of skilled artisans\n31-45\nGrumbling — Low-level discontent but no organized resistance\n46-65\nStable — Population accepting Christian rule; trade recovering\n66-80\nIntegration progress — Moriscos participating in economy; former tensions easing\n81-90\nEconomic growth — Granada's trade exceeds expectations; additional revenue\n91-100\nWINDFALL — Major Morisco leader publicly embraces Christianity; symbolic victory\n\nRoll when ready.\n\n3. ARAGON (Inherited Kingdom)\n\nContext: Only two years since Alfonso died and you inherited. You are Castilian—a foreigner to proud Aragonese who have their own Cortes, their own laws, their own Justicia (chief justice who can check royal power). They accepted you because Alfonso named you heir, but resentment simmers.\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-5\nCONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS — Cortes formally challenges your authority; threatens to withhold taxes/support\n6-12\nNoble faction forms — Aragonese grandees demanding \"Aragonese regent\" during your absences\n13-20\nJusticia intervenes — Legal challenge to some royal decree; authority questioned\n21-35\nResentment grows — Complaints about Castilian influence, but no action yet\n36-50\nMinor tensions — Border disputes with Navarre; trade arguments with Catalonia\n51-70\nGrudging acceptance — No enthusiasm, but no opposition either\n71-85\nWarming relations — Your crusade preparations seen as honoring Alfonso's legacy\n86-95\nActive support — Aragonese nobles volunteering for crusade; genuine enthusiasm\n96-100\nWINDFALL — Cortes votes additional funds; symbolic embrace of union\n\nRoll when ready.\n\n4. CATALONIA (Autonomous Principality)\n\nContext: Barcelona is a major Mediterranean trading power. The Catalans have ancient privileges and a merchant oligarchy that guards them jealously. They were loyal to Alfonso but see you as doubly foreign—Castilian and absent.\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-5\nTRADE WAR — Barcelona merchants in open conflict with royal policy; port blockades\n6-12\nPrivilege dispute — Generalitat (Catalan council) formally protests royal overreach\n13-25\nEconomic grievances — Complaints about Castilian/Genoese competition; demands for protection\n26-40\nSullen cooperation — Catalans obey but without enthusiasm\n41-60\nStable — Business as usual; trade continues\n61-75\nTrade prosperity — Barcelona benefits from crusade preparations; merchants profit\n76-90\nPolitical warming — Catalan leaders express satisfaction with your distant governance\n91-100\nWINDFALL — Major trade agreement or Catalan banking consortium offers support\n\nRoll when ready.\n\n5. VALENCIA (Mixed Population)\n\nContext: Large Mudejar (Muslim) population working the irrigated farmlands. Christian lords depend on their labor. Religious tension possible, but also economic interdependence.\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-8\nMUDEJAR UNREST — Rumors of Granada rebellion inspire local resistance; villages fortified\n9-15\nNoble feuds — Two major families in open conflict; violence in the countryside\n16-30\nIrrigation disputes — Water rights conflicts threatening harvest\n31-50\nMinor tensions — Religious friction, but contained\n51-70\nStable — Harvest good; population peaceful\n71-85\nAgricultural surplus — Excellent yields; additional export revenue\n86-100\nWINDFALL — New irrigation project completed early; major productivity gain\n\nRoll when ready.\n\n6. NAPLES (Italian Acquisition)\n\nContext: This is your most vulnerable territory. René of Anjou has a claim and is \"watching and waiting\" per the strategic assessment. The Neapolitan barons are notoriously treacherous—they betrayed every ruler for generations. You've held it only four years, and Italian politics are a snake pit.\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-8\nANGEVIN CONSPIRACY — René's agents have suborned barons; coup attempt or invasion imminent\n9-15\nBaronial revolt — One or more major lords in open rebellion\n16-25\nConspiracy uncovered — Plot discovered before execution; arrests, but network unclear\n26-40\nBaronial scheming — Factions maneuvering, but no open break yet\n41-55\nTense stability — Barons obey but watch for opportunity\n56-70\nGenuine loyalty — Some barons actively supporting your rule\n71-85\nEconomic recovery — Naples prospering under stable rule; trade increasing\n86-95\nRené discouraged — Intelligence indicates Angevins abandoning immediate plans\n96-100\nWINDFALL — Major baron publicly denounces René; Angevin cause collapses in Naples\n\nRoll when ready.\n\n7. SICILY (Island Kingdom)\n\nContext: Longer Aragonese connection than Naples. The Sicilian barons are powerful but less treacherous than Neapolitans. Grain exports are economically vital. Distance from the crown means local autonomy.\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-8\nBARONIAL WAR — Major feuds erupt into open warfare; grain exports disrupted\n9-18\nGrain crisis — Poor harvest or export disputes; revenue significantly reduced\n19-35\nLocal feuds — Minor violence between baronial families\n36-55\nStable — Barons governing their lands; grain flowing\n56-75\nProsperous — Good harvest; exports exceeding expectations\n76-90\nBaronial support — Sicilian lords volunteering for crusade fleet\n91-100\nWINDFALL — Exceptional harvest or valuable discovery on island\n\nRoll when ready.\n\n8. SARDINIA (Troubled Island)\n\nContext: Sardinia has been in near-constant rebellion for decades. Genoese interference, local Sardinian lords (Giudicati), malaria—it's a difficult territory that drains resources rather than contributing them.\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-15\nREBELLION FLARES — Sardinian lords in open revolt; Genoese ships supplying them\n16-30\nGenoese interference — Genoa (despite crusade commitment) allowing merchants to support rebels\n31-50\nChronic instability — Low-level resistance continues; garrison strained\n51-70\nUneasy peace — No major incidents this year\n71-85\nImproving situation — Local lords accepting crown authority\n86-100\nWINDFALL — Major rebel leader submits; island pacification advancing\n\nRoll when ready.\n\n9. CONSTANTINOPLE (Military Garrison)\n\nContext: Juan de Sotomayor commands ~700+ Military Order soldiers holding the walls alongside Greeks. The Ottoman truce holds until 1441, but Murad could probe. Greek-Latin tensions possible. Supply lines stretch across the Mediterranean.\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-5\nOTTOMAN ATTACK — Murad breaks truce early; Constantinople under siege\n6-12\nGreek-Latin violence — Serious incident; deaths; threatens cooperation\n13-25\nSupply crisis — Ships delayed; garrison on reduced rations\n26-40\nTensions — Minor friction between garrison and Greeks, but managed\n41-60\nStable — Garrison maintains discipline; walls secure\n61-75\nIntegration progress — Latin settlers and Greeks cooperating better\n76-90\nStrategic intelligence — Garrison gathers valuable information on Ottoman dispositions\n91-100\nWINDFALL — Greek nobles publicly praise garrison; Emperor expresses gratitude\n\nRoll when ready.\n\n10. PORTUGAL (Allied Kingdom — Separate Roll)\n\nContext: Portugal is not your territory, but the maritime union and family ties mean Portuguese instability affects you. King Duarte is your brother-in-law; his health and stability matter.\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-10\nROYAL CRISIS — Duarte seriously ill or political crisis threatening the union\n11-25\nStrain on alliance — Portuguese complaints about joint fleet arrangements\n26-50\nMinor friction — Normal diplomatic irritations\n51-75\nStable alliance — Maritime union functioning well\n76-90\nEnhanced cooperation — Henry the Navigator reports African expedition success\n91-100\nWINDFALL — Portugal offers additional crusade support unprompted\n\nRoll when ready.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nYou have 10 rolls to make:\n\nCastile\n\nGranada\n\nAragon\n\nCatalonia\n\nValencia\n\nNaples\n\nSicily\n\nSardinia\n\nConstantinople\n\nPortugal (allied)\n\nRoll a d100 for each territory.

      "text": "**How often did medieval kingdoms actually face rebellions?**\n- Major rebellions were rare - maybe once every decade or two in a well-governed kingdom\n- Minor noble disputes were constant but rarely threatened the crown\n- Plagues were periodic (every 10-20 years for major outbreaks after the Black Death)\n- Famines depended on weather - maybe 1 in 5 years had a bad harvest somewhere\n\n**Factors to consider for each territory:**\n\n1. **CASTILE** - This is Juan's home kingdom. He's ruled for 14 years. Álvaro de Luna is competent. The treasury is strong. Noble resentment of Luna exists but Juan has been consistently supportive of Luna. The Reconquista success has given him enormous prestige. Realistically:\n- Rebellion chance: Very low (5% at most)\n- Plague: Random, maybe 5-8%\n- Stability: High (70%+ chance of nothing notable)\n\n2. **GRANADA** - Conquered only 7 years ago. BUT Juan has been generous to Muslims, allowed religious practice, maintained economic stability. The Malian ambassador is currently touring to assess Muslim treatment. Historical parallels: Mudejars in Valencia and Aragon lived under Christian rule for centuries without major revolts when treated reasonably.\n- Rebellion chance: Low-moderate (10-15% in any given year)\n- Religious tension: Moderate\n- Economic integration working\n\n3. **ARAGON** - Only 2 years under Juan. BUT he inherited legitimately from Alfonso V. The Aragonese have strong institutions (Justicia, Cortes) that protect their autonomy - this actually REDUCES rebellion risk because they have legal channels for grievances. Juan hasn't done anything to provoke them.\n- Constitutional friction: Moderate possibility\n\n- Rebellion: Very unlikely - they'd use legal channels first. They're proud but not stupid, and Juan brings enormous resources.\n\n4. **CATALONIA** - Similar to Aragon. Strong institutions, proud autonomy, but Juan hasn't interfered. Barcelona profits from Mediterranean trade which Juan's naval expansion helps. Trade disputes are possible, but rebellion remains very unlikely since economic self-interest keeps them loyal.\n\n5. **VALENCIA** - Large Mudejar population BUT they've lived under Christian rule since the 1230s (200+ years). They're integrated into the economy and society, so the risk of uprising is minimal despite religious differences.\n\n6. **NAPLES** - This is the real vulnerability. René of Anjou has a claim, the barons are notoriously treacherous, and Alfonso only secured it after decades of struggle. With just 4 years of rule, Italian politics create genuine danger here—conspiracy risk runs 20-30%.\n\n7. **SICILY** - Longer Aragonese connection and island isolation mean less outside interference and lower rebellion risk compared to Naples. Baronial feuds exist but at normal medieval levels.\n\n8. **SARDINIA** - Historically troubled with constant low-level rebellion and Genoese interference. The question isn't whether unrest exists but whether it escalates into something worse.\n\n9. **CONSTANTINOPLE** - higher conspiracy and treachery percentages given Naples' volatile history. I should establish distinct probability tables for different territory types—stable allied regions like Portugal need different odds than recently conquered areas like Naples, which carries inherent instability risks. The framework should reflect that peaceful years in well-governed lands rarely produce major events, while contested territories demand much higher thresholds for trouble.\n\nYou're absolutely right. I was thinking like a game designer, not a historian. Let me reconsider each territory based on actual medieval realities.\n\nHISTORICAL CONTEXT: How Often Did Things Actually Go Wrong?\n\nMajor rebellions in well-governed kingdoms were rare—perhaps once or twice per reign, usually triggered by specific grievances (succession disputes, oppressive taxation, religious persecution, royal weakness).\n\nMinor noble feuds were constant background noise in every medieval society—not threats to the crown, just the normal friction of armed aristocrats.\n\nPlagues struck periodically—major outbreaks every 10-20 years after 1348, minor outbreaks more frequently.\n\nFamines depended on weather—perhaps 1 in 5-7 years saw a bad harvest somewhere.\n\nConspiracies were common in unstable situations (disputed successions, weak kings, foreign rule) but rare when a strong king held undisputed power.\n\nNow let me evaluate each territory honestly:\n\n1. CASTILE\n\nYears Under Your Direct Rule: 14 years (since achieving majority)\n\nFactors FOR Stability:\n\nYou are the legitimate, undisputed king with 14 years of successful rule\n\nTreasury exceeds 1 million florins—the kingdom is prosperous\n\nÁlvaro de Luna is a brilliant administrator with decades of experience\n\nThe Reconquista victory (1432) gave you enormous prestige—you finished what kings tried for 700 years\n\nNo succession dispute—you have a male heir (Fernando) and a spare (Nicolás)\n\nThe crusade preparations are popular; you're seen as a champion of Christendom\n\nChurch reform efforts have clerical support\n\nNo recent oppressive taxation—wealth has funded everything\n\nFactors AGAINST Stability:\n\nNoble resentment of Luna is real and chronic (he's a \"low-born upstart\" who controls access to the king)\n\nYou've been absent for months—conspirators have time to talk\n\nSome nobles may fear the crusade will drain Castilian resources for foreign adventures\n\nHistorical Comparison: Castile in the 1430s-40s was actually quite stable under Juan II historically. The instability came later (1440s-50s) and was driven by specific political conflicts, not random chance.\n\nRealistic Assessment: The chance of a major crisis in Castile while you're away for a few months is very low. Luna is competent, the treasury is full, and you have no enemies strong enough to challenge you openly.\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-2\nDISASTER — Noble league forms against Luna; crisis requiring immediate return\n3-5\nSerious illness — Plague outbreak in one major city (not Toledo)\n6-12\nNoble grumbling — Complaints about Luna's authority reaching concerning levels\n13-25\nMinor issues — Feuds, disputes, routine problems Luna handles\n26-85\nStable — Kingdom functioning normally under Luna's regency\n86-95\nPositive news — Reform progress, revenue exceeding projections, or popular enthusiasm for crusade\n96-100\nUnexpected boon — Significant windfall (discovery, diplomatic success, enemy misfortune)\n\nRoll when ready.\n\n2. GRANADA\n\nYears Under Christian Rule: 7 years (since November 1432)\n\nFactors FOR Stability:\n\nYou granted generous surrender terms—Muslims can practice their faith, keep property, maintain mosques\n\nNo forced conversions—those who converted did so voluntarily\n\nEconomic integration is working—silk trade, sugar production continuing\n\nThe Malian ambassador (Musa Keita) is currently touring to assess Muslim treatment—you have incentive to ensure things are peaceful\n\nMost former Nasrid elites fled to Morocco or accepted the new order\n\n7 years is enough time for the initial shock to fade\n\nYour Arabic fluency and cultural respect are known\n\nFactors AGAINST Stability:\n\n7 years is NOT enough time for complete acceptance—living memory of the Sultanate remains\n\nSome Muslims genuinely believe they should resist Christian rule on religious grounds\n\nEconomic disruption—some skilled artisans emigrated; others resent Christian settlers\n\nThe Alpujarras mountains provide refuge for rebels\n\nExternal agitation possible from Morocco (though Marinids are weak)\n\nOld Christian settlers may provoke incidents through arrogance or theft\n\nHistorical Comparison: The actual Granada (conquered 1492) saw major rebellion in 1499-1501 when the Spanish broke their promises and began forced conversions. Your Granada has NOT seen such provocations. The Mudejars of Valencia and Aragon lived under Christian rule for 200+ years without major revolts when treated reasonably.\n\nRealistic Assessment: You've kept your promises. The economy works. There's no external power strong enough to support a rebellion. The chance of a major uprising is low—perhaps 8-12% in any given year, and lower than that if nothing has provoked it.\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-3\nMAJOR UNREST — Coordinated resistance in the Alpujarras; requires military response\n4-8\nConspiracy discovered — Network of former Nasrid loyalists found; arrests required\n9-15\nReligious incident — Riot or violence between Old Christians and Muslims; deaths, property damage\n16-25\nEconomic strain — Emigration of artisans or trade disruption affecting silk/sugar revenue\n26-40\nLow-level tension — Grumbling, minor incidents, but nothing organized\n41-80\nStable — Population accepts Christian rule; economy functioning\n81-92\nIntegration progress — Muslims participating actively in economy; tensions easing visibly\n93-100\nNotable success — Major Muslim leader publicly endorses your rule, or exceptional economic performance\n\nRoll when ready.\n\n3. ARAGON\n\nYears Under Your Rule: 2 years (since Alfonso V's death, September 1437)\n\nFactors FOR Stability:\n\nYou inherited legitimately—Alfonso named you heir, and you are of the royal blood (Trastámara)\n\nThe Aragonese have strong constitutional institutions (Justicia, Cortes) that channel grievances legally rather than through rebellion\n\nYou haven't interfered with their privileges—in fact, you've been mostly absent, which they may prefer\n\nAlfonso was also frequently absent (chasing Naples for decades); they're used to an absentee king\n\nYour enormous resources (Castilian treasury, military power) make rebellion suicidal\n\nThe crusade is a Catholic cause they can support\n\nNo rival claimant—your succession was uncontested\n\nFactors AGAINST Stability:\n\nYou are Castilian—a foreigner. Aragonese pride is real.\n\nOnly 2 years—they don't know you well\n\nThey may demand constitutional concessions in exchange for crusade support\n\nSome nobles preferred Alfonso's hands-off approach and fear you might be more interventionist\n\nHistorical Comparison: Aragon had a strong tradition of constitutional monarchy. The famous phrase \"We who are as good as you swear to you who are no better than us\" captures their attitude. But this meant they negotiated, not rebelled. Rebellions happened when kings broke the constitution, not because they disliked a legitimate king.\n\nRealistic Assessment: Rebellion is extremely unlikely—perhaps 1-3%. Constitutional friction is more likely (15-25%)—they may demand something in exchange for cooperation. But outright defiance? They'd need a cause, and you haven't given them one.\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-2\nCONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS — Cortes or Justicia formally challenges a royal action; legal standoff\n3-8\nDemands for concession — Aragonese nobles insist on confirming privileges before supporting crusade\n9-20\nGrumbling — Complaints about Castilian influence, calls for Aragonese regent during absences\n21-40\nCool relations — Formal cooperation but no enthusiasm\n41-75\nAcceptance — Aragonese fulfill their obligations; no problems\n76-90\nWarming relations — Crusade seen as honoring Alfonso's legacy; genuine support emerging\n91-100\nEnthusiastic support — Aragonese nobles volunteer for crusade; Cortes offers additional funds\n\nRoll when ready.\n\n4. CATALONIA\n\nYears Under Your Rule: 2 years\n\nFactors FOR Stability:\n\nSame legitimate inheritance as Aragon\n\nBarcelona's merchants profit from Mediterranean trade—your naval expansion helps them\n\nStrong institutions (Generalitat) channel grievances legally\n\nYou haven't interfered with their privileges\n\nCatalan merchants are pragmatic—they care about money, and you're good for business\n\nFactors AGAINST Stability:\n\nCatalan identity is distinct—they don't consider themselves Castilian OR Aragonese\n\nBarcelona may resent competition from Genoese or Castilian merchants\n\nTrade disputes with other parts of your realm are possible\n\nThey guard their autonomy jealously\n\nHistorical Comparison: Catalonia's major conflicts with the crown came later (1462-1472 Civil War) and were triggered by specific political conflicts with Juan II of Aragon (a different Juan II). In the 1430s-40s, no such triggers exist.\n\nRealistic Assessment: Rebellion is nearly impossible without a specific grievance. Trade disputes or political friction are possible but unlikely to be severe. This is one of your most stable territories.\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-3\nTrade dispute — Barcelona merchants formally protest royal policy affecting their interests\n4-10\nGeneralitat complaint — Formal protest about some procedural matter; requires diplomatic response\n11-25\nMinor friction — Complaints about Castilian/Genoese competition; handled through normal channels\n26-65\nBusiness as usual — Catalans trading, prospering, ignoring politics\n66-85\nEconomic prosperity — Barcelona profits from crusade preparations; merchants satisfied\n86-100\nActive support — Catalan banking or shipping interests offer favorable terms for crusade\n\nRoll when ready.\n\n5. VALENCIA\n\nYears Under Your Rule: 2 years (same inheritance)\n\nFactors FOR Stability:\n\nMudejars have lived under Christian rule since the 1230s—over 200 years\n\nThey are economically integrated; Christian lords depend on their labor\n\nThe irrigation system (acequias) requires cooperation—everyone has incentive to maintain peace\n\nNo recent persecution or broken promises\n\nYour tolerance in Granada is known—Valencian Mudejars have no reason to fear worse treatment\n\nFactors AGAINST Stability:\n\nNoble feuds are endemic to Valencia (as everywhere)\n\nIrrigation disputes can escalate\n\nIf Granada rebels, it might inspire Valencian Mudejars—but only if Granada rebels\n\nHistorical Comparison: Valencian Mudejars remained largely peaceful for centuries. Major persecution came only after 1502 (forced conversion) and 1609 (expulsion). Nothing like that is happening now.\n\nRealistic Assessment: This is one of your most stable territories. Mudejar unrest is extremely unlikely without external provocation. Noble feuds are the main risk, and those rarely threaten the crown.\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-2\nSerious noble feud — Two major families in open conflict; violence requiring intervention\n3-8\nIrrigation dispute — Water rights conflict threatening agricultural output\n9-20\nMinor feuds — Normal noble squabbling; managed locally\n21-70\nStable — Harvests good, Mudejars peaceful, lords cooperating\n71-90\nAgricultural prosperity — Excellent yields; exports exceeding expectations\n91-100\nNotable success — New irrigation works completed or exceptional harvest\n\nRoll when ready.\n\n6. NAPLES\n\nYears Under Your Rule: 4 years (since Giovanna II's death, October 1435)\n\nFactors FOR Stability:\n\nAlfonso spent years securing the kingdom before his death—the groundwork is laid\n\nThe Battle of Aversa (1434) demonstrated military strength\n\nYou've had 4 years to identify and neutralize the worst troublemakers\n\nFactors AGAINST Stability:\n\nRené of Anjou has a claim and is \"watching and waiting\" per the strategic assessment\n\nThe Neapolitan barons are historically the most treacherous in Europe—they betrayed Giovanna I, Giovanna II, Ladislaus, Louis of Anjou, Alfonso himself (multiple times)\n\nItalian politics are a snake pit of shifting alliances\n\nYou are a foreigner twice over—not even Italian, let alone Neapolitan\n\n4 years is not long enough to root out all conspirators\n\nYour absence for the crusade creates opportunity\n\nPapal relations matter—Eugenius supports you, but popes have backed Angevins before\n\nVenetian intelligence is \"gathering information on both sides\"\n\nHistorical Comparison: Naples saw constant conspiracy and occasional civil war throughout the 15th century. Alfonso himself faced multiple baronial revolts. René of Anjou actually did invade (1438-1442 historically, though timeline differs here). This kingdom is genuinely dangerous.\n\nRealistic Assessment: Naples has the highest risk of any territory. I would estimate 15-25% chance of serious conspiracy or instability in any given year, especially during royal absence.\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-8\nCONSPIRACY DISCOVERED — René's agents have suborned barons; plot uncovered, but how deep does it go?\n9-15\nBaronial treachery — One or more lords in contact with Angevins; loyalty questionable\n16-25\nDangerous maneuvering — Barons forming factions; no open break but tension high\n26-45\nScheming but contained — Normal Italian politics; your officials managing it\n46-70\nTense stability — Barons obey, watch, wait\n71-85\nGenuine loyalty emerging — Some barons actively invested in your success\n86-95\nRené discouraged — Intelligence suggests Angevins see no opening\n96-100\nMajor success — Key baron publicly denounces Angevin cause; René's position weakens\n\nRoll when ready.\n\n7. SICILY\n\nYears Under Your Rule: 2 years (same inheritance, but Sicily had been Aragonese since 1282)\n\nFactors FOR Stability:\n\nSicily has been connected to Aragon for 150+ years—much longer than Naples\n\nThe Sicilian barons are powerful but less notoriously treacherous than Neapolitans\n\nIsland geography limits outside interference\n\nGrain exports are profitable—everyone benefits from stability\n\nNo rival claimant with Sicilian support\n\nFactors AGAINST Stability:\n\nBaronial feuds are normal for Sicily\n\nDistance from the crown means limited oversight\n\nIf Naples falls to the Angevins, Sicily might waver\n\nHistorical Comparison: Sicily was relatively stable under Aragonese rule. Major problems came from within the Aragonese dynasty (succession disputes), not from baronial rebellion.\n\nRealistic Assessment: Sicily is moderately stable. Baronial feuds might cause local problems but not threaten your rule. Serious instability is unlikely unless Naples collapses first.\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-3\nSerious baronial war — Major feuds erupt; grain exports disrupted; intervention needed\n4-10\nGrain crisis — Poor harvest or export dispute; significant revenue loss\n11-25\nBaronial feuds — Normal Sicily; violence between families, but contained\n26-65\nStable — Grain flowing, barons cooperating enough\n66-85\nProsperous — Good harvest; grain exports profitable\n86-100\nNotable support — Sicilian lords contribute ships or men for crusade\n\nRoll when ready.\n\n8. SARDINIA\n\nYears Under Your Rule: 2 years (but Aragonese presence since 1320s)\n\nFactors FOR Stability:\n\n...honestly, not many. Sardinia has been a problem for over a century.\n\nFactors AGAINST Stability:\n\nEndemic low-level rebellion—the local lords (Giudicati) have resisted Aragonese rule for generations\n\nGenoese interference—Genoa has interests on the island and historically supported rebels\n\nMalaria makes the island deadly for mainland soldiers\n\nDistance and difficulty mean royal attention is rare\n\nThe island drains resources rather than contributing them\n\nHistorical Comparison: Sardinia was a chronic headache for Aragon throughout the 14th and 15th centuries. Complete pacification never really happened until much later.\n\nRealistic Assessment: The question for Sardinia isn't \"will there be trouble?\" but \"will it get worse?\" Low-level resistance is the baseline. A major flare-up is possible but not certain in any given year.\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-10\nRebellion intensifies — Major lord in open revolt; Genoese ships supplying them\n11-25\nGenoese interference — Genoa (despite crusade commitment) tolerating merchant support for rebels\n26-55\nChronic instability — Same as always; low-level resistance, garrison strained\n56-75\nRelative quiet — No major incidents this year; garrison holding\n76-90\nImproving situation — Key rebel lord submits or dies; pacification advancing\n91-100\nSignificant progress — Major breakthrough in pacification; island becoming manageable\n\nRoll when ready.\n\n9. CONSTANTINOPLE\n\nYears of Garrison Presence: 5 years (since April 1434)\n\nFactors FOR Stability:\n\nOttoman truce holds until 1441—Murad has no reason to attack early\n\nStrategic assessment showed Murad is complacent (Roll: 8), focused on hunting rather than war\n\nYour garrison commander (Juan de Sotomayor) is experienced and professional\n\nThe garrison is small (~700) but disciplined Military Orders soldiers\n\nEmperor John VIII is grateful for your support—you saved him from Notaras\n\nYour personal diplomacy in 1434 built genuine goodwill\n\nYou're funding the Emperor with 22,000 florins annually—he needs you\n\nFactors AGAINST Stability:\n\nGreek-Latin religious tension is real—Orthodox and Catholics have centuries of mutual suspicion\n\nThe garrison depends on sea supply—disruption could be serious\n\nSome Greeks may resent Latin presence regardless of the Emperor's gratitude\n\nOttoman raiders might probe the defenses even without full war\n\nHistorical Comparison: Constantinople in this period (before 1453) was in decline but not yet in immediate peril. The Ottomans under Murad II were capable but not constantly aggressive—Murad actually preferred peace when he could get it.\n\nRealistic Assessment: With the truce in place and Murad complacent, the chance of an Ottoman attack is very low (2-5%). Greek-Latin friction is possible but your diplomacy has reduced it. Supply issues are the main realistic concern.\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-2\nOttoman probing — Murad tests the defenses despite truce; tense standoff\n3-6\nGreek-Latin incident — Serious confrontation between garrison and locals; requires resolution\n7-15\nSupply difficulties — Ships delayed; garrison on reduced rations; morale tested\n16-30\nMinor friction — Normal Greek-Latin tension; managed by Sotomayor and Emperor\n31-70\nStable — Garrison maintains discipline; walls secure; cooperation continues\n71-85\nImproved relations — Greeks and Latins cooperating better; integration advancing\n86-95\nStrategic intelligence — Garrison gathers valuable information on Ottoman dispositions\n96-100\nExceptional success — Emperor or Patriarch publicly praises garrison; Greek support for crusade\n\nRoll when ready.\n\n10. PORTUGAL (Allied Kingdom)\n\nThis is not your territory, but the maritime union and family connection mean Portuguese stability affects you.\n\nFactors FOR Stability:\n\nKing Duarte is your brother-in-law and personally committed to the alliance\n\nThe maritime union (Roll: 99 - \"Transformative\") was an exceptional diplomatic success\n\nHenry the Navigator's expeditions are succeeding—Portugal is prospering\n\nNo succession crisis—Duarte has heirs\n\nThe alliance benefits Portugal economically and strategically\n\nFactors AGAINST Stability:\n\nPortuguese nobles might resent Castilian influence\n\nHenry's expeditions are expensive\n\nDuarte's health is not documented but medieval kings died unexpectedly\n\nHistorical Comparison: Portugal in the late 1430s was actually entering a difficult period—historically, Duarte died in 1438 and a succession crisis followed. But in your timeline, the strategic assessment didn't flag Portuguese instability, suggesting Duarte is healthy and ruling effectively.\n\nRealistic Assessment: Portugal is very stable as an ally. Minor friction is possible but a crisis is unlikely without a specific trigger (like Duarte's death, which we haven't established).\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-3\nRoyal health concern — Duarte falls ill; succession fears arise\n4-10\nAlliance strain — Portuguese nobles complain about joint fleet arrangements\n11-25\nMinor friction — Normal diplomatic irritations; nothing serious\n26-70\nStable alliance — Maritime union functioning as intended\n71-90\nAlliance strengthening — Henry reports African success; cooperation deepening\n91-100\nExceptional cooperation — Portugal offers additional crusade support or resources unprompted\n\nRoll when ready.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nTerritory\nDisaster Risk\nSerious Problem Risk\nLikely Stable\nGood News Possible\nCastile\n2%\n10%\n72%\n15%\nGranada\n3%\n12%\n62%\n20%\nAragon\n2%\n18%\n54%\n25%\nCatalonia\n3%\n12%\n50%\n35%\nValencia\n2%\n8%\n60%\n30%\nNaples\n8%\n17%\n49%\n24%\nSicily\n3%\n12%\n52%\n35%\nSardinia\n10%\n15%\n40%\n25%\nConstantinople\n2%\n13%\n55%\n30%\nPortugal\n3%\n12%\n55%\n30%\n\nNaples and Sardinia are your danger zones.

Then roll for how successful they are before Juan returns\n\nI need to identify which nobles would realistically oppose Luna in 1439. The Infantes of Aragon are already dead in this timeline, so the major players would be families like the Manrique, Mendoza, and Stúñiga—all powerful magnates with their own territorial interests and grievances against Luna's influence over the crown.\n\nThe core opposition would come from those resentful of Luna's low-born status yet commanding position, those shut out from royal patronage, those threatened by his administrative changes, and those seeking direct access to Juan. I'll construct a conspiracy table reflecting these factional tensions among the great houses.\n\nREALM STABILITY RESULTS — September 1439\n\nTerritory\nRoll\nResult\nCASTILE\n1\nDISASTER — Noble league formed against Luna\nGranada\n100\nWINDFALL — Exceptional success\nAragon\n84\nWarming relations — Crusade seen as honoring Alfonso's legacy\nCatalonia\n82\nEconomic prosperity — Barcelona profiting from crusade preparations\nValencia\n46\nStable — Harvests good, peace maintained\nNaples\n30\nScheming but contained — Normal Italian politics, officials managing\nSicily\n74\nProsperous — Good harvest, grain exports profitable\nSardinia\n73\nRelative quiet — No major incidents; garrison holding\nConstantinople\n31\nStable — Garrison disciplined, walls secure\nPortugal\n13\nMinor friction — Normal diplomatic irritations\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nThe realm as a whole is remarkably healthy. Your Italian possessions—which you feared most—are quiet. Naples (Roll: 30) sees the usual baronial scheming but nothing your officials cannot handle. Sicily prospers. Even Sardinia, that chronic headache, is experiencing unusual peace.\n\nGranada has delivered extraordinary news (Roll: 100)—we will detail this windfall separately.\n\nAragon and Catalonia are warming to your rule. The crusade preparations have given the Aragonese pride in their new king, and Barcelona's merchants are profiting handsomely.\n\nPortugal's minor friction (Roll: 13) is nothing serious—likely complaints about joint fleet command arrangements that can be smoothed over diplomatically.\n\nBut Castile—your heartland, your core kingdom—has rolled a 1.\n\nWhile you were in Poland building alliances for the crusade, a conspiracy has formed against Álvaro de Luna. This is the nightmare scenario: not trouble in a distant conquest, but rebellion in your own house.\n\nTHE CASTILIAN CONSPIRACY\n\nA roll of 1 indicates a noble league—multiple great lords acting in concert against Luna. This is not one disgruntled baron; this is organized opposition.\n\nWho Are The Conspirators?\n\nLet us determine who leads this league. I will create a table of the great noble houses of Castile who might plausibly join such a conspiracy, with weighted probabilities based on historical grievances and current circumstances.\n\nPotential Conspirators:\n\nHouse\nHead\nHistorical Grievance\nCurrent Status\nProbability of Leading\nManrique\nRodrigo Manrique, Count of Paredes\nAncient enemies of Luna; excluded from royal favor\nBitter, ambitious\nHigh\nStúñiga (Zúñiga)\nPedro de Stúñiga, Count of Plasencia\nResent Luna's dominance; old Trastámara loyalists feel displaced\nPowerful in Extremadura\nHigh\nEnríquez\nFadrique Enríquez, Admiral of Castile\nHereditary office but Luna controls naval policy\nWealthy, proud\nMedium\nPimentel\nRodrigo Alonso Pimentel, Count of Benavente\nNorthern magnate; traditional rivalry with Luna's allies\nAmbitious\nMedium\nOsorio\nPedro Álvarez Osorio, Marquis of Astorga\nGalician power; resents Castilian centralization\nRegional influence\nMedium\nGuzmán\nJuan Alonso de Guzmán, Duke of Medina Sidonia\nControls Andalusia; may fear Luna's influence in conquered Granada\nEnormously wealthy\nLow-Medium\nMendoza\nÍñigo López de Mendoza, Marquis of Santillana\nPoet, scholar, powerful lord—but historically pragmatic\nCould go either way\nLow\n\nROLL 1: Who Leads the Conspiracy?\n\nRoll a d100 to determine the primary instigator:\n\nRoll\nPrimary Leader\n1-25\nRodrigo Manrique, Count of Paredes — The Manriques are Luna's oldest enemies. Personal hatred drives this.\n26-45\nPedro de Stúñiga, Count of Plasencia — The Stúñigas believe they should be the king's chief advisors.\n46-60\nFadrique Enríquez, Admiral of Castile — The Admiral wants Luna removed so he can control naval affairs.\n61-75\nRodrigo Pimentel, Count of Benavente — Northern lords uniting against the \"upstart\" from the south.\n76-85\nJuan Alonso de Guzmán, Duke of Medina Sidonia — Andalusian power play; fears Luna will control Granada's wealth.\n86-95\nCoalition leadership — No single leader; a council of lords acting together (more dangerous, harder to decapitate).\n96-100\nÍñigo López de Mendoza, Marquis of Santillana — If even the pragmatic Mendoza has joined, the situation is grave indeed.\n\nRoll when ready.\n\nROLL 2: How Many Houses Have Joined?\n\nAfter determining the leader, roll a d100 to see how broad the conspiracy has grown:\n\nRoll\nBreadth of Conspiracy\n1-20\nNarrow — The leading house plus 1-2 minor allies. Dangerous but containable.\n21-50\nModerate — 3-4 major houses involved. Serious threat requiring careful handling.\n51-80\nBroad — 5-6 major houses. This is a true noble league with significant military power.\n81-95\nExtensive — Most major houses except Luna's few allies. Kingdom on the brink.\n96-100\nNear-universal — Even houses you thought loyal have joined. Luna stands almost alone.\n\nRoll when ready.\n\nROLL 3: What Do They Want?\n\nNoble conspiracies have goals. Roll a d100:\n\nRoll\nDemands\n1-15\nLuna's death — They want him killed, not just removed. Assassination or \"trial.\"\n16-40\nLuna's exile — Permanent removal from court and confiscation of his estates.\n41-65\nLuna's diminishment — Strip him of offices; reduce him to merely one lord among many.\n66-85\nPower sharing — A royal council where nobles balance Luna's influence.\n86-100\nConstitutional reform — Cortes authority increased; permanent limits on royal favorites.\n\nRoll when ready.\n\nROLL 4: What Is Their Plan?\n\nHow do they intend to achieve their goals? Roll a d100:\n\nRoll\nMethod\n1-10\nAssassination — Murder Luna outright; present the king with a fait accompli.\n11-25\nCoup — Armed seizure of Toledo or another major city; force the king to negotiate.\n26-45\nUltimatum — Present formal demands backed by military threat; no violence unless refused.\n46-65\nPetition — Work through legal channels (Cortes); pressure the king upon his return.\n66-80\nSlow strangulation — Refuse cooperation with Luna; make governance impossible without yielding.\n81-100\nWait for the king — Do nothing overt yet; prepare their case for when Juan returns.\n\nRoll when ready.\n\nROLL 5: How Successful Are They Before You Return?\n\nYour journey from Kraków will take months—through Hungary, the Alps, Italy, then by sea to Castile. Perhaps you arrive in late November or December 1439. How much has the conspiracy achieved by then?\n\nRoll\nProgress\n1-15\nFully executed — Whatever their plan, it has happened. Luna is dead, imprisoned, or fled.\n16-35\nPartially executed — Plan underway; Luna under siege (literal or political); crisis active.\n36-55\nMobilized but not struck — Conspirators have gathered forces/allies but await your return or a trigger.\n56-75\nDiscovered — Luna or his agents have learned of the conspiracy; countermeasures begun.\n76-90\nCompromised — Key conspirators have wavered or been bought off; league weakening.\n91-100\nCollapsed — Internal divisions or Luna's actions have broken the conspiracy before it could act.\n\nRoll when ready.\n\nGRANADA WINDFALL (Roll: 100)\n\nWe should also detail Granada's exceptional success. After the Castilian crisis rolls, I will present options for what this windfall represents:\n\nA major Muslim leader publicly embracing your rule?\n\nExceptional economic performance (silk, sugar, silver)?\n\nMusa Keita's tour resulting in a transformative Malian alliance offer?\n\nSomething else entirely?\n\nPlease roll five d100s for the Castilian conspiracy:\n\nWho leads?\n\nHow broad?\n\nWhat do they want?\n\nWhat is their plan?\n\nHow successful before your return?",

      "text": "But actually this makes sense. They're building their position, isolating Luna, making him appear ineffective, and waiting for the right moment. The \"slow strangulation\" might be:\n1. Building the case against Luna (documenting his \"crimes\")\n2. Refusing to cooperate with his orders\n3. Withdrawing their men from royal service\n4. Starving him of resources\n5. Waiting for Juan to return so they can demand a \"trial\" (which they intend to end in execution)\n\nOR they might be waiting for the right moment to strike - the slow strangulation is the preparation phase, and the actual killing will come when Luna is sufficiently weakened and isolated. This is quite sophisticated and historically plausible. Noble conspiracies often worked this way - you don't just murder the king's favorite; you isolate him, discredit him, and then strike when he's vulnerable.\n\nNow I need to create a customized Roll 5 table that reflects this specific situation. The key variables are how effective their strangulation strategy proves and whether circumstances force them to accelerate their timeline.\n\nTHE CASTILIAN CONSPIRACY — CONSOLIDATED\n\nThe Conspirators\n\nPrimary Leader: Pedro de Stúñiga, Count of Plasencia\n\nThe Stúñigas are one of Castile's great families—powerful in Extremadura, holders of vast estates, and nursing a generations-old grievance. They were loyal Trastámara supporters during the civil wars that brought your dynasty to power. They believe that loyalty should have been rewarded with the position Luna now holds. Instead, a man of minor nobility—a bastard of the Lunas of Aragón—stands between them and the king.\n\nPedro de Stúñiga is not a hothead. He is patient, calculating, and has been waiting for the right moment. Your prolonged absence—months away in Italy and Poland—has given him that moment.\n\nBreadth: Moderate (3-4 Major Houses)\n\nThe conspiracy is serious but not universal. Roll to determine which other houses have joined:\n\nRoll\nAllied Houses\n1-25\nManrique (Count of Paredes) + Pimentel (Count of Benavente)\n26-50\nManrique (Count of Paredes) + Enríquez (Admiral of Castile)\n51-75\nPimentel (Count of Benavente) + Osorio (Marquis of Astorga)\n76-100\nEnríquez (Admiral of Castile) + Guzmán (Duke of Medina Sidonia)\n\nRoll a d100 to determine the allied houses.\n\nTheir Goal: Luna's Death\n\nThis is not about power-sharing or constitutional reform. Pedro de Stúñiga and his allies want Álvaro de Luna dead.\n\nThey may frame it as justice—a \"trial\" for corruption, tyranny, exceeding his authority. They may speak of protecting the king from an evil counselor. But the intended outcome is Luna's head on a block.\n\nThis is personal. This is final.\n\nTheir Method: Slow Strangulation\n\nHere is where the conspiracy becomes sophisticated—and historically authentic.\n\nThey are not attempting assassination (too risky, might fail, would make them murderers). They are not seizing cities (open rebellion against an absent but legitimate king would be treason).\n\nInstead, they are isolating Luna systematically:\n\nWithdrawing cooperation: Their knights do not answer Luna's summons. Their tax collectors find reasons for delay. Their judges rule against Luna's allies in property disputes.\n\nStarving him of resources: Men who would normally serve the crown find employment elsewhere. Loans that Luna needs become unavailable. Merchants who supplied the royal household discover shipping difficulties.\n\nBuilding the case: Every decision Luna makes is documented as evidence of tyranny. Every florin he spends is recorded as corruption. Every appointment he makes is noted as nepotism.\n\nPoisoning opinion: In taverns, in churches, in noble halls, men speak of how Castile groans under the upstart's yoke. How the true nobility is ignored. How the king—God bless him—is deceived by a serpent.\n\nWaiting for the king: When Juan returns, they will present their grievances formally. They will demand a trial. They will ensure the trial has only one possible verdict.\n\nThe goal is to make Luna so weakened, so isolated, so discredited that when they finally strike, it will seem like justice rather than murder.\n\nRoll 5: The Situation When You Return\n\nNow we must determine what has actually happened by the time you arrive in Castile (late November/December 1439).\n\nThe conspirators are executing a slow strangulation while preparing for your return. But Luna is not a fool—he has survived decades of noble hatred. And circumstances may intervene.\n\nKey Variables:\n\nHow effective has the strangulation been?\n\nHas Luna discovered the conspiracy's full extent?\n\nHave the conspirators maintained unity, or have some wavered?\n\nHas anyone escalated to violence (either side)?\n\nWhat position will you find upon arrival?\n\nRoll\nSituation Upon Your Return\n1-5\nLuna has struck first. He discovered the conspiracy and moved against the plotters. Arrests, seizures, accusations of treason. The conspirators cry tyranny; some have fled to their castles. You return to find your kingdom on the edge of civil war—but Luna controls Toledo and claims to act in your name.\n6-15\nViolence has erupted. Someone—a hot-headed retainer, an overzealous agent—has shed blood. A Stúñiga man killed, or a Luna ally found dead. The slow strangulation has become an open wound. Both sides are mobilizing. You return to armed camps and demands for justice.\n16-25\nLuna is besieged. Not literally—no army surrounds Toledo—but politically and economically. The strangulation has worked. Royal orders go unheeded in Extremadura, in the north. The treasury functions but revenues are delayed. Luna's allies are frightened, some defecting. He holds on, but barely, waiting desperately for your return.\n26-40\nStalemate. Luna knows something is wrong but not its full extent. The conspirators have damaged his position but not broken it. Both sides are preparing for the confrontation that will come when you return. The kingdom functions but everyone is watching, waiting. Tension is thick in every court.\n41-55\nLuna has intelligence but not proof. Isaac de Baeza's network has caught whispers. Luna knows the Stúñigas are plotting, suspects others, but lacks evidence for action. He has quietly strengthened his position—loyal men in key places, funds secured, allies warned. The conspirators don't know he knows. You return to a powder keg where Luna is better prepared than his enemies realize.\n56-70\nConspiracy partially exposed. One of the lesser conspirators lost his nerve and talked, or was careless with correspondence. Luna knows the outline but not the full membership. Some conspirators have pulled back; others are committed. The league is damaged but not destroyed.\n71-80\nKey defection. One of the major houses has reconsidered. Perhaps they learned the goal is Luna's death, not merely his diminishment, and that was further than they wished to go. Perhaps Luna offered them something. The conspiracy has lost a pillar and the remaining members are uncertain whether to proceed.\n81-90\nInternal division. The conspirators have quarreled over method, timing, or the spoils of victory. Stúñiga wants one thing; his allies want another. The league still exists but is weakened by distrust.

      "text": "The Castilian Conspiracy Summary:\n- Leader: Pedro de Stúñiga, Count of Plasencia\n- Allies: Rodrigo Manrique (Count of Paredes) + Fadrique Enríquez (Admiral of Castile)\n- Goal: Luna's death\n- Method: Slow strangulation\n- Current situation: Conspiracy partially exposed - one lesser conspirator talked or was careless, Luna knows the outline but not full membership, some have pulled back, others committed, league damaged but not destroyed.\n\nNow for Granada windfall (Roll: 100). This should be something genuinely exceptional and historically plausible. Let me think about what could constitute a true windfall:\n\n1. Musa Keita's tour results in exceptional Malian alliance - trade deal, gold access\n2. Major Muslim leader publicly endorses Juan's rule - legitimacy, reduces tension\n3. Exceptional economic performance - silk, sugar, or silver revenues far exceed expectations\n4. Discovery of something valuable - resources, ancient texts, etc.\n5. Former Nasrid loyalists abroad abandon hope of reconquest - Morocco gives up claims\n6. Religious harmony achievement - some kind of breakthrough in Christian-Muslim relations\n7. A prominent conversion that's genuine and influential\n8. The silver mining (already discovered) yields even more than expected\n9. Something related to the African trade enterprise\n10. Granada becomes a model that attracts positive attention from other powers\n\nGiven the context:\n- Musa Keita is touring Granada/Toledo to assess Muslim treatment\n- The silver mines were already a Roll: 100 discovery\n- African trade enterprise is ongoing\n- Juan's Arabic fluency and cultural respect are known\n\n- A perfect roll demands outcomes that genuinely reshape Granada's trajectory - not just incremental gains but something that establishes it as a unique power in Iberia. The table should weight toward transformative possibilities that align with Juan's strengths and the current political moment.\n\nCASTILIAN CONSPIRACY — FINAL SUMMARY\n\nLeader: Pedro de Stúñiga, Count of Plasencia\n\nAllied Houses:\n\nRodrigo Manrique, Count of Paredes (Luna's oldest personal enemy)\n\nFadrique Enríquez, Admiral of Castile (wants control of naval affairs)\n\nGoal: Luna's death—framed as justice, but death nonetheless.\n\nMethod: Slow strangulation—economic isolation, political pressure, building a case for \"trial\" upon the king's return.\n\nCurrent Situation (Roll: 68 — Conspiracy Partially Exposed):\n\nOne of the lesser conspirators was careless. Perhaps a letter fell into the wrong hands. Perhaps a retainer talked in his cups. Perhaps a priest heard something in confession and felt bound to warn Luna.\n\nWhatever the source, Álvaro de Luna now knows the outline: the Stúñigas are moving against him, and they are not alone. He suspects the Manriques—those two families have always hated him. He has heard whispers about the Admiral, though that wounds him; he thought Enríquez was a man of honor.\n\nBut Luna does not know everything. He does not know they want him dead, not merely diminished. He does not know how far their preparations have advanced. He does not know who else might be involved—or who might be wavering.\n\nThe conspirators, for their part, know something has gone wrong. The lesser man who talked has disappeared—fled to a monastery, perhaps, or simply vanished. They do not know exactly what Luna knows. Some are urging caution; others say they must act before Luna strikes first.\n\nWhen you return, you will find:\n\nLuna aware of danger but uncertain of its full extent\n\nThe conspirators damaged but not destroyed\n\nBoth sides preparing for confrontation\n\nSome houses pulling back, others committed\n\nThe kingdom tense, waiting for the king's judgment\n\nGRANADA WINDFALL — Roll: 100\n\nA roll of 100 is extraordinary. This should represent something genuinely transformative—not merely \"good news\" but a development that changes Granada's trajectory.\n\nContext to Consider:\n\nMusa Keita, the Malian ambassador, is currently touring Muslim communities in Toledo and Granada\n\nThe silver mines in the Sierra Nevada were already discovered (previous Roll: 100)\n\nSeven years of tolerant rule have allowed some integration\n\nYour Arabic fluency and cultural respect are known throughout the Islamic world\n\nThe African Trade Enterprise is active\n\nGranada's silk and sugar industries are valuable\n\nThe question is: What kind of windfall?\n\nRoll\nNature of Windfall\n1-15\nMALIAN BREAKTHROUGH — Musa Keita's report to the Mansa is so favorable that Mali offers an unprecedented trade agreement: direct gold-for-goods exchange bypassing North African middlemen, exclusive Castilian access to certain routes, or even a formal embassy exchange. This would transform your African enterprise from profitable venture to strategic dominance.\n16-30\nRELIGIOUS RECONCILIATION — A prominent Muslim scholar—perhaps the most respected faqih (jurist) remaining in Granada—publicly declares that Muslims may live faithfully under your rule. He issues a fatwa stating that a just Christian king who keeps his word is preferable to the chaos of resistance. This carries weight far beyond Granada; it undermines the religious case for rebellion throughout your Mudejar populations.\n31-45\nECONOMIC EXPLOSION — Granada's silk industry has exceeded all projections. Skilled artisans who initially emigrated are returning, bringing techniques learned in Morocco and Egypt. Combined with stable governance, Granada is becoming the silk capital of the western Mediterranean. Revenue from Granada alone now rivals a minor kingdom.\n46-60\nDIPLOMATIC COUP — Word of your treatment of Muslims has reached the Marinid Sultan in Morocco. Despite the corsair problems, he sends a secret embassy: he wishes to negotiate. Perhaps recognition of your sovereignty over Granada in exchange for trade rights. Perhaps something more—an alliance against mutual enemies. The implications are profound.\n61-75\nCULTURAL FLOWERING — Granada under your rule is becoming a center of learning. Christian, Muslim, and Jewish scholars are collaborating on translations, astronomy, medicine. The University you may have patronized is attracting students from across Europe and the Islamic world. Granada is being spoken of as a new Toledo—the Toledo of the translation movement that preserved classical learning. Your name is being mentioned alongside Alfonso the Wise.\n76-85\nCONVERSION OF CONSEQUENCE — A member of the former Nasrid royal family—someone whose conversion cannot be dismissed as coercion or opportunism—has publicly embraced Christianity. They speak of your justice, your honor, your keeping of oaths. This is not just one convert; this is a symbolic surrender of the old order's legitimacy. Nasrid loyalists in exile are devastated.\n86-95\nSTRATEGIC INTELLIGENCE — Granada's Muslims, feeling protected rather than persecuted, have become your eyes and ears in the Islamic world. Through merchant networks and family connections, Isaac de Baeza's agents now have access to information from Morocco to Egypt. You receive detailed intelligence on Ottoman fleet movements, Mamluk politics, and Marinid intentions that no Christian king has ever possessed.\n96-100\nTHE IMPOSSIBLE GIFT — Something unprecedented. Roll again on this table and combine TWO results, or the GM determines a unique windfall that combines multiple elements into something truly historic.\n\nRoll a d100 to determine the nature of Granada's windfall.",

The mosques still stand. The muezzin still calls the faithful to prayer. Muslim judges still settle disputes according to Sharia in matters between Muslims. No forced conversions. No expulsions. No confiscation of property beyond what the surrender terms specified.\n\nThe Muslims of Granada have watched. They have waited. They have tested, in small ways, whether the Christian king's word was true.\n\nIt was.\n\nAnd now, something remarkable has happened—not through any single dramatic event, but through the slow accumulation of trust over seven years.\n\nWhat Isaac de Baeza Reports\n\nWhen you return to Toledo, Isaac de Baeza will present you with a development he himself finds extraordinary. The Jewish spymaster has spent decades building intelligence networks through merchants, conversos, and paid informants. It is difficult, dangerous work—bribes, threats, the constant risk of exposure.\n\nIn Granada, something different has emerged.\n\nThe Muslims are volunteering.\n\nNot for money. Not from fear. Because they have decided—collectively, organically, without any formal agreement—that your kingdom is worth protecting.\n\nThe Network\n\nMerchant Connections:\nGranadan silk traders maintain relationships with counterparts across the Islamic world—Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt, even Constantinople's Muslim quarter. These are not spies; they are businessmen. But businessmen hear things. And now, when they hear things, they tell people who tell Isaac de Baeza.\n\nFamily Networks:\nMany Granadan families have relatives who emigrated after the conquest—to Fez, to Tlemcen, to Tunis. Letters pass back and forth. News travels with them. A cousin in Morocco mentions that Marinid ships are being provisioned. An uncle in Tunis describes Egyptian merchants worried about Mamluk military preparations. A brother in Oran reports Ottoman agents seeking North African allies.\n\nScholarly Correspondence:\nGranada's ulama (religious scholars) correspond with colleagues throughout the Islamic world. These letters discuss theology, law, philosophy—but also politics. The disposition of Muslim rulers toward the Ottomans. The mood in Cairo. The health of the Marinid Sultan.\n\nReturning Emigrants:\nSome who fled in 1432 have come back—drawn by family, by the economy, by the realization that life under a just Christian king is better than poverty in an overcrowded Moroccan city. They bring fresh intelligence from years abroad.\n\nWhat You Now Know\n\nIsaac de Baeza has compiled reports that no Christian monarch has ever possessed:\n\nOn the Ottoman Empire:\n\nConfirmation that Sultan Murad II remains focused on leisure—hunting, poetry, his harem\n\nHis Grand Vizier Çandarlı Halil Pasha counsels peace with Christians; he is a faction of one but influential\n\nThe Janissary corps maintains readiness despite the Sultan's disinterest—professional soldiers do not forget their training\n\nOttoman naval strength in the Aegean: approximate numbers, port locations, state of repair\n\nProvincial governors in Rumelia are nervous; they sense unrest in the Balkans but cannot identify its source\n\nOn the Mamluks:\n\nSultan Barsbay is hostile to the Ottomans (confirming your strategic assessment Roll: 15)\n\nInternal court intrigues occupy Egyptian attention\n\nNo appetite for western adventures; they will not aid Murad\n\nOn the Marinids:\n\nThe Sultan in Fez is weak; real power rests with Wattasid viziers\n\nThe corsair release (your strategic assessment Roll: 52/64) is confirmed—deliberate harassment, not serious warfare\n\nNo capacity for major military action; the dynasty is dying\n\nOn North African Opinion:\n\nYour treatment of Granada's Muslims is known. Discussed in mosques from Fez to Cairo.\n\nYou are spoken of as \"al-Malik al-'Adil\"—the Just King\n\nSome scholars have issued opinions that trade with Castile is permissible, even praiseworthy\n\nThe Malian ambassador Musa Keita's favorable impressions are already filtering back through merchant networks\n\nStrategic Implications\n\nFor the 1441 crusade, this intelligence network provides:\n\nEarly Warning: Any Ottoman naval mobilization will be reported within weeks, not months\n\nStrategic Clarity: You know Murad's court politics, his commanders' dispositions, his fleet's condition\n\nDiplomatic Leverage: Knowledge of which Muslim powers might be quietly pleased to see Ottoman setbacks\n\nOperational Security: Your Granadan informants can identify Ottoman agents attempting to penetrate your own networks\n\nIsaac de Baeza, who has spent a lifetime in the shadows, will tell you plainly: \"Your Majesty, I have served three kings. I have never had intelligence like this. These people are not my agents. They are your subjects, and they have chosen to protect you. Guard this gift carefully. One broken promise, and it disappears forever.\"\n\nThe Deeper Meaning\n\nThis is not merely useful. It is historic.\n\nFor seven hundred years, Christian and Muslim fought across Iberia. The Reconquista was a war of extermination, expulsion, forced conversion—depending on the century and the king. The assumption, on both sides, was that coexistence was impossible. That one faith must triumph and the other submit or flee.\n\nYou have proven otherwise.\n\nNot through weakness or compromise, but through strength guided by honor. You conquered Granada utterly—and then kept your word. The Muslims submitted to your sword—and found that your word was good.\n\nThe intelligence network is a symptom, not the disease. The disease is trust. And trust, once established, can grow into something no one anticipated.\n\nSUMMARY OF REALM STATUS\n\nTerritory\nRoll\nOutcome\nCastile\n1\nCRISIS — Stúñiga conspiracy partially exposed; Luna aware but not of full extent\nGranada\n100\nWINDFALL — Strategic intelligence network; \"al-Malik al-'Adil\"\nAragon\n84\nWarming relations; crusade honors Alfonso's legacy\nCatalonia\n82\nEconomic prosperity; Barcelona profiting\nValencia\n46\nStable\nNaples\n30\nScheming but contained\nSicily\n74\nProsperous; good harvest\nSardinia\n73\nRelative quiet\nConstantinople\n31\nStable\nPortugal\n13\nMinor friction\n\nYou face a paradox: your greatest triumph (Granada) and your greatest danger (Castile) await you simultaneously.

      "text": "Current location: Road departing Kraków, September 12, 1439\nDestination: Toledo, Castile\n\nThe route would be:\n1. From Kraków south through the Carpathians into Hungary\n2. Across Hungary to the Danube\n3. Through Habsburg lands (Austria) to the Alpine passes\n4. Over the Alps into Italy\n5. Down through Italy - possibly stopping in Rome for the papal blessing for the crusade\n6. To a port (likely Genoa, Naples, or another Italian port)\n7. By sea to Spain (Valencia, Barcelona, or directly to a Castilian port)\n8. Overland to Toledo\n\nThis is a significant journey - probably 2-3 months under normal circumstances. The user wants to get home fast, which means:\n- Pushing the pace\n- Minimal stops\n- Possibly skipping the Rome visit (or making it very brief)\n- Good weather needed\n- No accidents or illness\n- No delays from bandits, politics, etc.\n\nFactors affecting the journey:\n- Season: September-November/December - autumn turning to winter\n- Alps crossing: Gets dangerous in late autumn/winter\n- Sea voyage: Mediterranean storms increase in autumn/winter\n- Party size: 500 Castilian men + 8 Polish/Hungarian knights + Father Stanisław - this is a large group that moves slower than a small party\n- Political situation: Need to pass through Hungary (friendly - Władysław's territory), Habsburg lands (neutral?), various Italian states\n- The 8 Polish/Hungarian knights are supposed to go to Toledo for academy training\n\nThe urgency factors:\n- Luna conspiracy brewing in Castile\n- Lucia is pregnant\n- Kingdom needs its king\n\nLet me create a realistic table that accounts for:\n1. Speed of travel (can they push the pace?)\n2. Alpine crossing (weather, conditions)\n3. Italian passage (political complications?)\n\n4. Sea voyage (weather, pirates?)\n5. Overall time\n\nI need to consolidate this into one table showing the range of outcomes. Best case has everything aligned—smooth passage, rapid movement, arrival by late October or early November. Average case accounts for typical medieval delays and complications, putting arrival in late November or December. Worst case involves serious obstacles like storms, accidents, or political friction that could push the return much later or create additional problems. Medieval travel times suggest roughly two weeks from Kraków to Vienna at a good pace, with the Alpine crossing and sea voyage being the most unpredictable segments.\n\nSeptember 12 departure plus eight weeks of ideal conditions means early November arrival; twelve weeks puts him back in early December; sixteen weeks with significant delays extends into late December or January. The papal blessing mentioned in the chapter summary presents a choice—Juan could pursue it en route or skip it given the Castilian urgency, which would affect the timeline. I should build a table accounting for these variables and the resource advantages Juan possesses.\n\nJuan has substantial funding and military support, travels through largely allied lands, but faces the complication of late autumn weather and the inherent slowness of a large retinue. The Alpine crossing represents the most significant hazard. I'll construct probabilities favoring successful passage while acknowledging genuine risks from seasonal conditions and the size of his party.\n\nTHE JOURNEY HOME — Kraków to Toledo\n\nStarting Point: Road south from Kraków, September 12, 1439\nParty: 500 Castilian men-at-arms, 8 Polish/Hungarian knights, Father Stanisław\nObjective: Reach Toledo as quickly as possible\n\nRoute Options\n\nThe standard route would be:\n\nKraków → Hungary (through Carpathian passes) — ~2 weeks\n\nHungary → Vienna (across the Hungarian plain) — ~1 week\n\nVienna → Alpine passes (through Habsburg lands) — ~1 week\n\nAlps → Italy (via Brenner, Tarvis, or similar) — ~1-2 weeks depending on conditions\n\nItaly → Port (Genoa, Venice, or riding south to Naples) — ~1-2 weeks\n\nSea voyage to Spain (to Valencia, Barcelona, or Cartagena) — ~1-2 weeks\n\nSpanish port → Toledo — ~1 week\n\nMinimum realistic time: 8-9 weeks (early November arrival)\nNormal time: 10-12 weeks (late November/December arrival)\nWith significant delays: 14+ weeks (January 1440 or later)\n\nFactors Affecting the Journey\n\nFOR Speed:\n\nAmple funds for fresh horses, provisions, lodging\n\n500 armed men discourage bandits\n\nPassing through friendly territory (Hungary is Władysław's realm; you just signed an alliance)\n\nStrong motivation—you know something is wrong at home (even if not the details)\n\nExperienced military column, accustomed to hard marching\n\nAGAINST Speed:\n\nLarge party (500 men) moves slower than a small escort\n\nSeason: Late September through November—autumn rains, early mountain snows possible\n\nAlpine crossing: The passes become dangerous after October; heavy snow can close them entirely\n\nSea voyage: Mediterranean autumn storms; sailing season traditionally ends in November\n\nPolitical complications: Must pass through Habsburg lands, various Italian states\n\nThe Polish/Hungarian knights are not accustomed to this pace\n\nIllness or accident could strike anyone, including you\n\nWILD CARDS:\n\nDo you stop in Rome for the papal blessing? (adds 1-2 weeks but secures crusade legitimacy)\n\nDo you receive news of the conspiracy en route? (messengers could find you in Italy)\n\nDo you push through dangerous Alpine conditions or wait for a break in weather?\n\nThe Journey Roll\n\nRoll a d100 to determine how the journey unfolds:\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-3\nDISASTER — Catastrophic Alpine accident, serious illness, or shipwreck. You are delayed by months, injured, or lose significant men. Arrival: January 1440 or later. The conspiracy has time to fully develop.\n4-8\nSevere delays — Early mountain snows trap you for weeks, or Mediterranean storms force you to winter in an Italian port. Arrival: Late December/January. Luna's situation deteriorates significantly.\n9-15\nSignificant problems — A combination of bad weather, a minor illness, and difficult Alpine conditions. You push through but lose time and men are exhausted. Arrival: Mid-December. You stop briefly in Rome (Eugenius grants blessing quickly, sensing your urgency).\n16-25\nHarder than expected — Autumn rains turn roads to mud; the Alpine crossing is tense but successful; one sea delay due to weather. Arrival: Early December. You skip Rome—send a letter explaining urgency and promising a proper visit.\n26-40\nNormal journey — The expected difficulties of late-season travel, but nothing exceptional. Good planning and resources see you through. Arrival: Late November. Brief Rome stop possible if you choose (2-3 days maximum).\n41-60\nSmooth travel — Weather cooperates, Alpine passes still open, sea voyage uneventful. The column makes good time. Arrival: Mid-November. Time for a proper Rome visit if desired, or home even faster if you skip it.\n61-75\nBetter than expected — Mild autumn weather, excellent road conditions, favorable winds at sea. The men are in good spirits. Arrival: Early November. You have time for Rome and still arrive before conspirators expect you.\n76-88\nExceptional speed — Everything aligns: dry weather, clear passes, a fast ship with perfect winds. You push hard and the men respond. Arrival: Late October. The conspirators are caught completely off-guard by your early return.\n89-95\nRemarkable fortune — Not only does everything go perfectly, but you receive intelligence en route. A messenger from Luna finds you in Venice or Genoa with a carefully worded letter hinting at troubles—enough to warn you without alerting potential interceptors. You arrive late October, forewarned and prepared.\n96-100\nProvidence — The journey is blessed. Perfect weather, an unusually fast ship, roads dry and clear. You arrive in late October, and moreover, something happens during the journey that strengthens your position—perhaps a key conspirator's agent is caught trying to reach you with false information, revealing the conspiracy's hand. Or a loyal lord intercepts you with detailed intelligence. You return not merely fast, but armed with knowledge.\n\nThe Rome Question\n\nYour original plan included stopping in Rome to receive Pope Eugenius IV's formal blessing for the crusade. This matters—papal endorsement is not merely symbolic; it provides:\n\nSpiritual legitimacy (crusade indulgences, moral authority)\n\nFinancial support (the 50-75k florins mentioned in strategic assessment)\n\nPolitical cover (no Christian prince can oppose a papal crusade)\n\nHowever, you are now racing against a conspiracy. Every week matters.\n\nIf you roll 41 or higher, you will have the option to:\n\nStop in Rome (2-5 days): Secure the blessing, accept minor delay\n\nSkip Rome: Send a letter of explanation, promise to visit after resolving matters at home, gain the time\n\nIf you roll 26-40, stopping in Rome adds enough delay that you must choose: blessing or speed.\n\nIf you roll 25 or below, you will not have time for Rome regardless—survival and speed take priority.\n\nRoll when ready.",

Will push through Alpine passes regardless of weather\n6. If news of conspiracy reaches him, doesn't change plans - already going as fast as possible\n7. The table should stop when a choice needs to be made - then we draft a new table for that specific situation\n\nSo I need to think about this more granularly. The journey has several legs:\n\n1. Kraków to Hungary (Carpathian passes) - friendly territory (Władysław's realm)\n2. Hungary across to Habsburg lands/Austria - still relatively safe\n3. Habsburg lands to Alpine passes - this is where it gets trickier\n4. Alpine crossing - the dangerous part in late season\n5. Northern Italy to Genoa - should be safe\n6. Sea voyage Genoa to Barcelona - weather dependent\n7. Barcelona to Toledo - safe, Spanish territory\n\nAt what point does Juan split off? Probably once he's through Hungary and into Habsburg/Italian lands. Let me think about a realistic smaller party - maybe 20-50 men? Enough for protection but fast.\n\nThe user wants me to create a table for the whole journey, but stop if there's a decision point. So I should create a table that either:\n- Results in smooth journey (various speeds)\n- Results in a specific problem that requires a decision/new table\n\nLet me draft this more realistically. The main risks are:\n1. Alpine weather (October crossing is risky)\n2. Sea voyage (autumn Mediterranean)\n3. Illness\n4. Accident\n5. Political complications (unlikely but possible)\n\nGiven Juan is:\n- Splitting off with smaller group = faster\n\n- Skipping Rome = saves 1 week+\n- Pushing through Alps regardless of weather = risky but committed\n- Not stopping for news = committed to speed\n\nHis aggressive approach means the table should emphasize the trade-offs between speed and safety. The risks compound as he moves through the more dangerous sections—the Alpine crossing in late season is the critical juncture where weather becomes a real factor, and the sea voyage adds another layer of uncertainty. I should structure the table to show how his commitment to speed plays out across each leg, with the understanding that he's willing to accept significant risks to reach Toledo quickly.\n\nTHE JOURNEY HOME — Revised\n\nStarting Point: Road south from Kraków, September 12, 1439\n\nInitial Party:\n\n~150 armed men (men-at-arms, knights)\n\n~350 servants, officials, grooms, baggage handlers\n\n8 Polish/Hungarian knights for the academy\n\nFather Stanisław (Polish chaplain)\n\nThe Plan:\nOnce through Hungary and into safer Italian territory, you split from the main column. The bulk of your party—servants, baggage, the slower travelers—continues at normal pace under a trusted captain. You ride ahead with a small, fast escort.\n\nRoute: Kraków → Carpathian passes → Hungary → Habsburg lands → Alpine passes (Brenner or Tarvis) → Northern Italy → Genoa → Barcelona (by sea) → Toledo\n\nNo Rome stop.\n\nSplitting the Party\n\nWhen: Upon reaching northern Italy (likely Treviso, Verona, or similar)\n\nFast Party (with you):\n\n~30-40 mounted men (your best riders, personal guard)\n\nThe Polish/Hungarian knights (young, fit, motivated)\n\nMinimum baggage—one pack horse per two men\n\nRiding hard, changing horses when possible\n\nSlow Party (continuing behind):\n\nThe remaining armed men\n\nAll servants and officials\n\nBaggage train\n\nWill arrive in Castile weeks later\n\nThis is how medieval kings traveled when speed mattered. A small party of good horsemen can cover 40-50 miles per day. A baggage train covers 15-20.\n\nJourney Legs & Timeline\n\nLeg\nDistance\nNormal Time\nFast (Small Party)\nKraków → Hungarian plain\n~200 miles\n10-12 days\n8-10 days\nHungary → Vienna area\n~150 miles\n7-8 days\n5-6 days\nVienna → Alpine passes\n~200 miles\n8-10 days\n6-7 days\nAlpine crossing\n~80 miles\n5-7 days\n3-5 days (weather dependent)\nNorthern Italy → Genoa\n~200 miles\n8-10 days\n5-6 days\nGenoa → Barcelona (sea)\n~400 nautical miles\n5-10 days\nWeather dependent\nBarcelona → Toledo\n~350 miles\n10-12 days\n6-8 days\n\nOptimistic total (everything goes well): Late October arrival\nRealistic total (normal difficulties): Mid-November arrival\nPessimistic (significant problems): December or later\n\nThe Journey Roll\n\nYour aggressive approach (small fast party, pushing through Alps, skipping Rome) increases both your best-case and worst-case outcomes. You'll either arrive very fast or encounter serious trouble.\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-5\nALPINE CRISIS — The passes present a serious obstacle. Early snows, dangerous conditions. You must make hard choices. Stop here—new table for Alpine crossing.\n6-10\nSEA TROUBLE — You reach Genoa without major incident, but Mediterranean conditions are dangerous. Captains are reluctant to sail. Stop here—new table for sea passage options.\n11-15\nIllness strikes — You or a key member of your party falls seriously ill during the journey. Not fatal, but debilitating. You lose 2-3 weeks to recovery. Arrival: Early December.\n16-22\nAccumulated delays — Nothing catastrophic, but a series of minor problems: lame horses, a swollen river crossing, slow Alpine passage, waiting three days in Genoa for suitable weather. Arrival: Late November.\n23-35\nHard but successful — The journey is exhausting. You push through difficult Alpine conditions (but manage). The sea crossing is rough but completed. Men and horses are spent when you arrive. Arrival: Mid-November.\n36-50\nAs expected — A fast, hard journey with the normal difficulties of late-season travel. The Alps are passable. The sea cooperates. You arrive tired but intact. Arrival: Early-to-mid November.\n51-65\nGood fortune — Mild autumn weather holds longer than expected. The Alpine passes are clear. You find a ship in Genoa ready to sail immediately. Arrival: Late October.\n66-80\nExcellent journey — Everything aligns. Dry roads, open passes, favorable winds. Your small party makes remarkable time. Arrival: Mid-to-late October. The conspirators have no idea you're close.\n81-90\nExceptional speed — A blessed journey. You reach Genoa faster than anticipated, find a Catalan merchant ship departing that very day, and the winds are perfect. Arrival: Mid-October. You catch everyone—friend and enemy alike—completely off-guard.\n91-95\nSpeed and intelligence — Not only do you arrive by mid-October, but you encounter someone useful en route: a Castilian merchant in Genoa, a loyal noble's agent in Barcelona, or a letter from Luna that found its way to you. You arrive early AND informed.\n96-100\nProvidence smiles — The journey is almost supernaturally smooth. You arrive in early-to-mid October, and moreover, something happens that gives you advantage: perhaps you intercept a conspirator's messenger, or a wavering lord seeking to warn you finds you first. You return not merely fast, but armed with specific intelligence about the conspiracy's membership or plans.\n\nRoll when ready.",

      "text": "1. Juan leaves Kraków September 12, 1439\n2. He travels through Hungary (friendly - Władysław's realm) - about 8-10 days, so around September 20-22\n3. Through Habsburg lands to the Alpine approaches - another 5-7 days, so late September\n4. Now he's at the Alpine passes and it's late September/early October\n\nLate September/early October is actually early for serious Alpine snows, but an early cold snap is possible. More likely it's a combination of factors: early snows at the highest elevations, rain/sleet at lower elevations making trails treacherous, and the knowledge that conditions will only get worse.\n\nThe passes available would be:\n- Brenner Pass (most common, connects Innsbruck to Bolzano/Verona) - relatively low at ~4,500 ft\n- Tarvis/Predil Pass (further east, connects Villach to Udine) - also relatively low\n- Various higher passes that would be more dangerous\n\nThe crisis is: do you push through dangerous conditions, wait for better weather (losing precious time), or try an alternate route?\n\nLet me draft this scenario and table.\n\nTHE ALPINE CRISIS\n\nKraków to the Mountains — September 12-29, 1439\n\nThe first legs of the journey pass well enough. Hungary is Władysław's realm, and word of your alliance has spread—local lords offer hospitality, fresh horses are available, the roads are decent. You push hard, and your men respond. The Polish and Hungarian knights prove their worth; young László Hunyadi rides as if born to the saddle.\n\nYou cross into Habsburg territory without incident. The Emperor Frederick III is a distant, ineffectual figure, but his officials recognize a king traveling with armed escort and have no desire for complications. They wave you through with formal courtesy and private relief.\n\nBy late September, you have reached the Alpine approaches. You are ahead of schedule—the aggressive pace has worked. Innsbruck lies behind you, and the Brenner Pass awaits.\n\nThen you see the mountains.\n\nThe Problem\n\nThe locals shake their heads. Zu früh, they say. Too early. This should not happen yet.\n\nBut it has.\n\nAn early cold front has swept down from the north. At the lower elevations where you stand, it manifests as bitter rain that soaks through cloaks and chills to the bone. But higher up—where the pass crosses—the rain becomes snow. Not the light dusting of early autumn, but heavy, wet snow that accumulates on the trails, obscures the path, and turns rock faces into death traps.\n\nThe Brenner Pass is not closed. Men have crossed in worse conditions. But the mountain guides you consult are blunt:\n\n\"It can be done, Herr König. Men cross the Brenner in winter. But not safely. Not quickly. You will lose horses. You may lose men. If the weather worsens while you are in the high pass, you will be trapped—perhaps for days, perhaps forever.\"\n\nThe innkeeper in the last village adds his own assessment: \"Three days ago, a merchant train attempted the crossing. They turned back after two days. Four mules dead. Two men with frostbitten hands. And they were experienced Alpine travelers.\"\n\nYou look up at the peaks, shrouded in grey cloud. Somewhere up there, the snow falls steadily.\n\nYour Options\n\nOPTION A: Force the Brenner\n\nPush through regardless. You have good men, strong horses, and motivation that merchants lack. Accept the losses. Every day you wait, the conspiracy in Castile grows stronger.\n\nRisk: High. You will certainly lose horses, probably lose some men. If conditions worsen mid-crossing, you could be trapped for days or suffer catastrophic losses.\n\nReward: If successful, you lose only 2-3 days to the difficult crossing and continue to Genoa.\n\nOPTION B: Wait for a Break\n\nThe weather may improve. Early-season storms often pass quickly. A few days of patience could open the pass.\n\nRisk: The weather might not improve—or might worsen. You could wait a week and find conditions even more impossible. Every day waiting is a day the conspirators have.\n\nReward: A safer crossing if the weather breaks.\n\nOPTION C: Eastern Route via Tarvis\n\nThe Tarvis Pass (Predil) lies to the east—lower elevation, potentially less snow. But it requires backtracking several days and adds distance. You would descend into Friuli and approach Genoa from the east.\n\nRisk: Adds 5-7 days minimum to your journey. The Tarvis might also be affected by the same weather system.\n\nReward: Possibly safer crossing; the eastern passes are sometimes more sheltered.\n\nOPTION D: Southern Route via Venice\n\nAbandon the Genoa plan. Head east to Venice instead, then take ship from there to Barcelona (or even directly to Valencia/Cartagena, which is closer to Toledo).\n\nRisk: Venetian shipping is more expensive and less reliable for Spanish destinations. Adds significant time—perhaps a week or more. Venice itself may delay you (politics, formalities, finding suitable ship).\n\nReward: Avoids the Alps entirely if you can reach Venice via lower passes or the Friulian plain.\n\nOPTION E: Extreme Measure — Ride Around the Alps\n\nGo east through Hungary, then south through Croatia and down the Dalmatian coast to reach Italy by land, avoiding the Alps entirely.\n\nRisk: Adds 3-4 weeks minimum. Passes through less stable territory. By the time you reach Castile, it will be December or January.\n\nReward: No mountain crossing at all. But is this even worth considering given your urgency?\n\nThe Alpine Crossing Table\n\nIf you choose to force the Brenner (Option A):\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-10\nCatastrophe. A sudden whiteout, an avalanche, or a collapsed trail section. You lose 8-15 men and most of your horses. Survivors struggle back to the village or press forward on foot. You are delayed 2-3 weeks recovering, finding new mounts, and burying your dead. The crossing becomes a trauma that haunts the survivors.\n11-20\nSevere losses. The crossing is brutal. You lose 4-7 men (falls, exposure, accidents) and a dozen horses. The survivors are exhausted and some are injured. You make it through but lose 7-10 days to recovery on the Italian side.\n21-35\nPainful but successful. You lose 2-3 men and several horses. Everyone suffers—frostbite, exhaustion, fear. But you are through. You lose 3-4 days to the difficult crossing and another 2-3 days recovering before you can ride hard again.\n36-50\nHard crossing. You lose horses—perhaps 5-8—and one man (a fall, a heart giving out from exertion, exposure). The rest make it through battered but functional. You lose 2-3 days total.\n51-70\nDifficult but manageable. The guides know their work. You lose 2-3 horses and no men, though several have minor frostbite. The crossing takes 4 days instead of the normal 2-3, but you emerge intact.\n71-85\nBetter than expected. A brief break in the weather—just enough. The snow stops for a day, the clouds lift slightly, and your guides seize the moment. You lose one horse to a fall but no men. Through in 3 days.\n86-95\nFortune favors the bold. The weather breaks just as you enter the high pass. What looked impossible becomes merely difficult. You cross in 3 days with no losses, emerging on the Italian side as the snow resumes behind you.\n96-100\nProvidence. The storm clears completely for 48 hours—a gap that the locals call a miracle. You cross the Brenner in perfect conditions, arriving on the Italian side rested and intact. You have lost nothing and gained time.\n\nIf you choose to wait (Option B):\n\nRoll a d100 to determine how long you must wait and what conditions you find:\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-15\nWeather worsens. You wait three days and conditions deteriorate. Now even the optimists say the pass is closed until spring. You must choose another route—Option C, D, or E—having lost three precious days.\n16-30\nNo improvement. A week passes. The weather neither improves nor worsens significantly. You have lost seven days. You may now force the Brenner (roll on the table above with +10 bonus) or choose another route.\n31-50\nSlow improvement. Five days of waiting. The weather gradually clears. The pass is crossable—not safe, but better than before. Roll on the force table above with +15 bonus.\n51-70\nWeather breaks. After three days, the storm passes. The pass is still snow-covered but manageable. Roll on the force table above with +20 bonus.\n71-85\nQuick clearing. Two days of waiting, then clear skies. The snow begins to melt at lower elevations. Cross with +25 bonus on the force table.\n86-100\nPerfect timing. One day of rest—which your men needed anyway—and the weather clears completely. The crossing is routine. No losses, no delays beyond the single day of waiting.\n\nWhat do you choose?\n\nOption A: Force the Brenner now (roll on first table)\n\nOption B: Wait for weather (roll on second table)\n\nOption C: Eastern route via Tarvis (I will draft consequences)\n\nOption D: Abandon Alps, go via Venice (I will draft consequences)\n\nOption E: Ride around via Dalmatia (I will draft consequences)",

      "text": "1. The rider ahead to Venice - this is good diplomacy. Venice is a major power, and a king traveling through their territory should announce himself. The offer to meet the Doge and admire Venice is flattering.\n\n2. The request to have ship captains ready - practical, saves time.\n\n3. The route - from the Alpine approaches (near Innsbruck area) to Venice. This would involve:\n   - Going east/southeast through the Friulian plain or through the lower passes\n   - The Tarvis pass is one option but lower\n   - Or going through the Carnic Alps via lower routes\n   - Or heading to Trieste area and then along the coast\n\nActually, from Innsbruck area, the easiest route to Venice avoiding high passes would be:\n- East to Villach (through relatively lower passes)\n- Then south through the Friulian plain to Venice\n- Or through the Pustertal valley east, then south\n\nThis is still mountain travel but through lower, more manageable passes. The weather affecting the Brenner might be less severe at lower elevations.\n\nFactors to consider:\n- The rider ahead is a smart move - buys goodwill and arranges logistics\n- Venice's relationship with Juan: per the strategic assessment, Venice is \"hedging all bets\" (Roll 42) with an \"intelligence windfall\" (Roll 74) - they're gathering info on both sides. They're not hostile but they're not committed allies either.\n- Venice would be flattered by a visit from a powerful king\n- The Venetian shipping connection to Spain exists but isn't as strong as Genoa's\n- Time of year - late September/early October - sailing season is ending but not over\n- Juan writing in Italian himself is a nice touch - shows cultivation\n\nWhat could go right:\n\nVenice might welcome him warmly and provide a capable vessel, with the Doge pleased by the royal visit and relationship improving. I could gather useful intelligence while securing a fast passage. What could go wrong: ceremonial delays might consume time, suitable ships might not be immediately available, Venetian negotiators could press for concessions, and the lower Alpine routes still present some challenges despite being more manageable than the Brenner.\n\nTHE VENETIAN PIVOT\n\nThe Decision\n\nYou turn your horse's head east.\n\nThe Brenner looms above you, white and deadly. You have looked at it, measured the risk, and made the calculation: the conspiracy in Castile is dangerous, but arriving dead or with half your escort lost to the mountains serves no one.\n\nVenice it is.\n\nThe Messenger\n\nYou summon one of your best riders—a young Castilian named Rodrigo de Valladolid, chosen for his horsemanship, his discretion, and his passable Italian. You retire to the inn's common room, call for pen and ink, and compose the letter yourself.\n\nTo His Serenity Francesco Foscari, Doge of Venice, from Juan, by the Grace of God King of Castile, León, Aragon, Naples, and Sicily, Defender of Romania:\n\nGreeting and fraternal affection.\n\nProvidence has redirected our path. The Alpine snows, arriving before their season, have persuaded us to seek the hospitality of your Most Serene Republic rather than risk the Brenner's treachery.\n\nIf it please Your Serenity, we would pass through Venetian territory en route to our Spanish kingdoms. We travel with small escort and seek no ceremony—only passage and, if a suitable vessel might be found, transport to Iberian shores.\n\nYet we confess that the fame of Venice has long stirred our admiration. Should Your Serenity find it agreeable, we would consider it an honor to pay our respects and marvel, however briefly, at the splendor of La Serenissima.\n\nWe have instructed our messenger to make inquiry among the ship captains of your excellent harbor regarding suitable passage to Barcelona or Valencia. Any assistance your officials might render in this matter would earn our lasting gratitude.\n\nWritten by our own hand at [village name], in the Alpine approaches, this [date] day of September, in the year of Our Lord 1439.\n\nJuan Rex\n\nYou seal it with your personal signet—not the great seal of Castile, which travels with your baggage, but the smaller ring you wear always. Rodrigo takes the letter, bows, and rides east into the gathering dusk.\n\nThen you give orders to break camp at dawn.\n\nThe Route to Venice\n\nFrom the Alpine approaches, you will ride east through the valleys toward Villach, then south through the Friulian plain to Venice. This route:\n\nAvoids the high passes entirely\n\nPasses through Habsburg territory, then Venetian possessions\n\nCovers approximately 200-250 miles\n\nTakes 6-8 days for a small, fast party pushing hard\n\nThe weather that closed the Brenner will be less severe at lower elevations, but autumn rains may slow you.\n\nFactors in Play\n\nFOR a good outcome:\n\nYour letter is diplomatically masterful—flattering without groveling, requesting without demanding\n\nWriting it yourself in Italian demonstrates cultivation; the Venetians will notice\n\nVenice profits from good relations with the ruler of Naples and Sicily\n\nAdvance notice allows the Doge to prepare an appropriate reception\n\nAsking ship captains to prepare saves time upon arrival\n\nYou travel light and fast\n\nVenice's economy depends on trade; providing ships is what they do\n\nAGAINST a good outcome:\n\nVenice is \"hedging all bets\" per the strategic assessment—they gather intelligence on everyone, commit to no one\n\nThe Doge may see an opportunity to extract concessions or gather information\n\nVenetian ceremony and protocol could delay you with elaborate welcomes\n\nLate season means fewer ships making the long western Mediterranean run\n\nBarcelona/Valencia are Catalan/Aragonese ports—Venetian shipping traditionally focuses on the eastern Mediterranean\n\nThe Venetians may wonder why you're in such a hurry—and what you're hurrying toward\n\nWILD CARDS:\n\nVenice has been gathering intelligence on \"both sides\" (your crusade and the Ottomans)—what might they share, or ask?\n\nThe Doge is Francesco Foscari, an ambitious and capable leader—he plays his own game\n\nGenoese merchants in Venice may help or hinder (Genoa and Venice are rivals)\n\nYour identity as King of Naples makes you Venice's neighbor—and potential rival in the Adriatic\n\nThe Venice Journey Table\n\nRoll a d100:\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-5\nDiplomatic disaster. Something goes badly wrong—your messenger is delayed or the letter misinterpreted, you arrive before word reaches the Doge, or Venetian officials create obstacles. You are held up for days sorting out formalities, offended dignities, or bureaucratic tangles. A ship is eventually found but the whole affair costs you 10-14 days and leaves a sour taste. Arrival in Castile: Late November/December.\n6-12\nVenetian delays. The Doge welcomes you—but too warmly. Elaborate ceremonies, formal banquets, diplomatic conversations that cannot be cut short without giving offense. The Venetians are extracting value from your visit: prestige, information, perhaps hints about your intentions regarding Adriatic trade. A suitable ship takes time to arrange. You lose 7-10 days in Venice. Arrival in Castile: Mid-to-late November.\n13-20\nShip problems. Venice receives you courteously, but finding suitable westbound passage proves difficult. Most Venetian shipping goes east. You must wait 5-7 days for a Catalan or Genoese vessel, or accept a slower Venetian ship making an unusual run. Arrival in Castile: Mid-November.\n21-30\nCorrect but slow. Everything proceeds properly but without special favor. The Doge receives you with appropriate ceremony (which you cannot refuse). A ship is found within reasonable time. The journey is neither helped nor hindered by Venetian hospitality. The sea crossing is uneventful but not fast. Arrival in Castile: Early-to-mid November.\n31-45\nSmooth passage. Your letter achieves its purpose. The Doge is flattered by your personal correspondence and offers appropriate hospitality—enough for honor, not so much as to delay. A suitable ship is ready when you arrive. The sea crossing goes well. Arrival in Castile: Early November.\n46-60\nVenetian efficiency. The Serenissima's famous bureaucracy works in your favor for once. Your messenger's advance work pays off: when you arrive, a ship is already arranged, provisions loaded, captain briefed. The Doge receives you for a brief, cordial audience. You are at sea within two days of reaching Venice. Arrival in Castile: Late October/Early November.\n61-75\nFavorable reception. Doge Foscari sees opportunity in cultivating the ruler of Naples and Sicily. He provides a fast Venetian galley—an honor usually reserved for the Republic's own ambassadors—and expedites your departure. A brief but warm meeting leaves both sides pleased. Arrival in Castile: Late October.\n76-85\nExcellent outcome. The Doge is genuinely impressed by your letter and your reputation. Venice provides one of its best ships, a experienced captain familiar with western waters, and favorable terms. Foscari hints that Venice might be more forthcoming about certain intelligence regarding Ottoman naval dispositions—if future cooperation proves fruitful. Arrival in Castile: Mid-to-late October.\n86-93\nStrategic success. Everything aligns: fast travel to Venice, warm reception, immediate ship, perfect weather for sailing. Moreover, Foscari—perhaps seeing which way the wind blows with your crusade—shares something genuinely useful: Venetian intelligence on Ottoman fleet movements, or information about Italian politics that affects your interests. Arrival in Castile: Mid-October. You return informed as well as fast.\n94-97\nUnexpected boon. A Catalan merchant ship, already loaded and bound for Barcelona, happens to be in Venice awaiting final cargo. The captain is honored to carry the King of Aragon. You barely pause in Venice—a brief audience with the Doge, mutual expressions of goodwill—and catch the tide. Arrival in Castile: Early-to-mid October.\n98-100\nProvidence and politics align. The Doge has been waiting for an opportunity like this. Venice's \"hedging\" suddenly resolves: Foscari decides that backing your crusade offers better returns than neutrality. He provides his personal state galley, the fastest ship in the Adriatic, with a crack crew. During your brief meeting, he commits Venice to supporting the crusade with naval assets—a diplomatic coup that reshapes the strategic picture. And he shares specific intelligence: names of Ottoman commanders, fleet dispositions, even rumors from Constantinople. You arrive in Castile by early October, not merely fast but having achieved a major diplomatic victory en route.\n\nRoll when ready.",

Every king has. The Republic that built an empire from trade. The city that humbled Constantinople, defied popes, and grew fat on the wealth of East and West. You have dealt with Venetian ambassadors, Venetian merchants, Venetian bankers. You know them as sharp dealers, subtle diplomats, masters of information.\n\nBut you have never seen it.\n\nTowers and domes rise from the water as if floating. The great campanile of San Marco pierces the autumn sky. Hundreds of ships crowd the harbor—galleys, carracks, fishing boats, barges—more ships than you have ever seen in one place, even at Barcelona or Genoa. The morning light catches the water and throws rippling reflections against pale stone walls.\n\nIt is, you must admit, magnificent.\n\nBut you have no time for magnificence.\n\nArrival — October 6, 1439, Late Morning\n\nThe Venetian escort guides you to the mainland docks at Mestre, where boats await to convey you across the lagoon.

If you would permit us to convey you across the lagoon...?\"\n\nThe boats are ready. Liveried oarsmen stand at attention. Across the water, Venice gleams.\n\nYou do not like this.\n\nWhat Rodrigo Reports\n\nYou find him at the Doge's Palace, after a boat crossing that felt interminable despite its brief duration. He has been housed in a comfortable chamber—too comfortable, he notes—and treated with elaborate courtesy. But when you finally speak privately, his face is troubled.\n\n\"Your Majesty, I delivered the letter as instructed. The Doge received it warmly. He sent his own secretary to assure me of his welcome.\"\n\n\"And the ships?\"\n\nRodrigo hesitates. \"I made inquiries at the harbor, as you commanded. There are ships—Catalan merchants, a Genoese galley, even some Venetian vessels that might make the western run.\"\n\n\"And?\"\n\n\"I was... discouraged, Majesty. A Venetian official appeared within the hour. He explained that His Serenity wished to personally ensure suitable arrangements for so honored a guest. That I should not trouble myself with such matters. That everything would be handled.\"\n\nHe meets your eyes.\n\n\"The captains I spoke with grew reluctant to continue our conversations after that. One Catalan told me plainly: 'The Serenissima has expressed interest in your master's journey. I will not contract without their approval.'\"\n\nYour jaw tightens.\n\nThe Venetians are not refusing you passage. They are managing you. Controlling the timing, extracting maximum value from your presence. Every day you spend here is a day of banquets, ceremonies, diplomatic conversations—and information flowing to Venetian intelligence about your plans, your intentions, your urgency.\n\nThey have noticed you are in a hurry. And they want to know why.\n\nThe Situation\n\nYou are in the Doge's Palace. Francesco Foscari awaits you in the great reception hall—you can hear the murmur of assembled dignitaries through the doors. An audience is expected. To refuse would be a grievous insult to a power you cannot afford to antagonize, especially given Venice's strategic position regarding the crusade.\n\nBut every hour you spend here, the conspiracy in Castile grows stronger. Luna does not know you are coming. The Stúñigas and their allies have time to prepare.\n\nThe doors to the reception hall stand before you.

It could be seen as:\n   - Charming and populist\n   - An insult to the Doge (bypassing his carefully arranged reception)\n   - A clever way to gather information outside official channels\n   - Naïve\n   - Calculating\n\n3. Who might show up:\n   - Curious nobles wanting to see this foreign king\n   - Merchants hoping for trade opportunities (especially those trading with Spain/Naples)\n   - Spies sent by the Council of Ten to observe\n   - Genoese merchants (rivals of Venice, might see opportunity)\n   - Ship captains (including those Juan needs!)\n   - Social climbers\n   - The genuinely curious\n   - Nobody (if the Doge discourages attendance)\n   - Someone important who wants to speak outside official channels\n\n4. The Venetian official's reaction will be key - this is a strange request\n\nLet me draft the official's response first, then the table.\n\nThe table should reflect:\n- Low rolls: The Doge is offended or controls the situation, few show up, or wrong people show up\n- Mid rolls: Mixed results, some useful contacts but also complications\n- High rolls: The gambit works, useful people appear, perhaps even ship captains or intelligence\n\nI need to consider that Venice is \"hedging all bets\" per the strategic assessment and gathering intelligence on everyone. They will certainly send observers no matter what.\n\nThe official stares at you for a long moment. His stylus hovers motionless over the tablet.\n\n\"Any... Venetian, Your Majesty?\"\n\nHe blinks twice, rapidly.\n\n\"I shall... convey Your Majesty's gracious invitation. A most... unconventional gesture. Most generous.\"\n\nHe makes a note, though his hand seems uncertain of what exactly to write.\n\n\"I should mention, Your Majesty, that the Ca' Foscari's dining hall seats perhaps forty comfortably. Sixty if additional tables are brought. Shall I arrange for provisions to be increased? The Doge's household will of course supply whatever is needed.\"\n\nHe hesitates, then adds carefully:\n\n\"Your Majesty understands that word of such an invitation will spread quickly in Venice. The city talks. By evening, half the Republic will have heard that the King of Castile and Aragon and Naples opens his table to... anyone.\"\n\nHis tone is neutral, professional. But his eyes are calculating, trying to understand what game you are playing.\n\n\"Shall I specify any particular hour? And does Your Majesty wish the invitation announced in the Piazza San Marco, or merely... circulated through appropriate channels?\"\n\nTHE OPEN TABLE — Dinner Invitation Results\n\nContext: You have invited \"any Venetian\" to dine with you tonight at the Ca' Foscari. This is unprecedented. Kings do not do this. The Venetians will be confused, intrigued, suspicious, and curious in equal measure.\n\nWhat the Venetians Will Certainly Do:\n\nThe Council of Ten will send observers (spies disguised as guests)\n\nThe Doge's household will monitor everything\n\nWord will spread rapidly through the city\n\nWhat Might Happen:\n\nThe Doge could be offended and discourage attendance\n\nThe Doge could be intrigued and encourage attendance\n\nMerchants might see opportunity\n\nShip captains might appear (exactly what you need)\n\nNobles might come out of curiosity\n\nSocial climbers might seize the chance\n\nGenoese residents might see an opening with a rival power\n\nSomeone important might want to speak outside official channels\n\nThe wrong people might dominate the evening\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-5\nDoge's displeasure. Word circulates quietly: His Serenity considers the foreign king's invitation... irregular. Attendance would not be smiled upon. Only a handful of minor figures appear—social outcasts, the desperate, a few drunks who didn't get the message. The evening is awkward and useless. Worse, you have offended Foscari. Tomorrow's meeting will be cold.\n6-12\nControlled attendance. The Doge sends \"appropriate\" guests—minor officials, a few merchants of middling importance, younger sons of noble houses. Pleasant enough company, but clearly curated. No ship captains. No one of real consequence. The Council of Ten's observers outnumber genuine guests. You learn nothing useful and have gained nothing except a reputation for eccentricity.\n13-20\nAwkward evening. A mixed crowd appears—some curious nobles, some merchants, some obvious spies. The conversation is stilted; no one knows quite how to behave at such an unusual event. A few ship captains attend but are reluctant to discuss business in such a public setting. You make some contacts but nothing concrete. The Venetians remain puzzled by your intentions.\n21-30\nMerchant interest. Word reaches the trading houses: the King of Naples and Sicily—master of Mediterranean ports—is accessible tonight. Merchants appear in force, eager to discuss trade privileges, tariffs, and opportunities. The conversation is dominated by commercial matters. Useful for future economic dealings, but no immediate help with your ship problem. One or two captains attend but cannot commit without Venetian approval.\n31-45\nGenuine curiosity. Venice loves novelty, and you are novel. A good crowd appears—nobles, merchants, scholars, a few captains, even an artist or two. The evening is lively. You make a favorable impression. Several guests mention ships, western routes, contacts who might help. Nothing definite, but doors are opening. The Doge's observers report that you are charming but inscrutable.\n46-60\nThe captains come. Your gambit works as intended. Among the curious nobles and hovering spies, three or four ship captains appear—men who heard that a king needs passage west and wanted to present themselves personally rather than negotiate through Venetian intermediaries. You can speak with them directly. At least one has a suitable vessel. The Doge's officials watch but cannot interfere without causing a scene.\n61-75\nUnexpected connections. The dinner draws an interesting mix, including someone you did not expect: a Catalan merchant with a ship nearly ready to sail for Barcelona, who came specifically because your invitation offered a way around Venetian gatekeeping. He can depart within two days if you wish. Additionally, a minor Venetian noble proves genuinely friendly—his family has interests in Naples and he sees value in personal connection with you.\n76-85\nThe Doge adapts. Foscari is a clever man. Rather than fighting your unconventional approach, he embraces it. He sends his own son to attend as a gesture of goodwill—and to observe. The evening becomes a social triumph. Ship captains compete for your attention. Merchants offer favorable terms. The son reports to his father that you are shrewd, unpredictable, and worth cultivating. Your ship problem will be solved by morning, with Venetian blessing.\n86-93\nIntelligence windfall. Among the guests is someone who wanted to speak with you outside official channels—a Venetian noble with connections to the eastern trade who has information about Ottoman naval movements. He sought the informal setting deliberately. You gain both practical help (a ship is arranged) and strategic intelligence that will matter for the crusade. The Doge hears of this and is impressed rather than offended; you have played the Venetian game better than expected.\n94-97\nA bold guest. The dinner draws a remarkable figure: a member of the Council of Ten itself, attending privately, without official sanction. He wishes to discuss matters that Venice cannot officially acknowledge—support for your crusade that the Republic cannot publicly commit to while maintaining Ottoman trade relationships. He can arrange your ship tonight and suggests future... arrangements. The Doge will hear of this and be forced to take you more seriously.\n98-100\nThe Doge himself. An hour into dinner, a stir at the door. Francesco Foscari has come in person—informally, without ceremony, \"as a fellow citizen accepting your generous invitation.\" It is an extraordinary gesture that signals Venice's serious interest in you. The evening becomes a private summit disguised as a social occasion. By the time he leaves, you have a ship, Venetian intelligence on the Ottomans, and the beginning of a genuine alliance. Venice will support the crusade—quietly, deniably, but materially.\n\nRoll when ready.",

The Foscari arms carved above the water gate. Torches burning in iron brackets, their light dancing on the dark water.\n\nInside, the servants have worked miracles on short notice. The dining hall gleams with candlelight. Silver has been laid, wine decanted, food prepared—Venice does not allow a king to host a poor table, even on a few hours' notice. Whatever the Doge thinks of your irregular invitation, he has ensured you will not embarrass the Republic with inadequate hospitality.\n\nYour men have been settled in chambers throughout the palazzo. The Polish and Hungarian knights are wide-eyed at the splendor—young László Hunyadi touches a silk wall hanging as if uncertain it is real. Father Stanisław has found the chapel and is praying, perhaps for deliverance from so much worldly magnificence.\n\nAnd then the guests begin to arrive.\n\nThe Crowd\n\nThey come by boat, of course—everything in Venice comes by boat. Gondolas cluster at the water gate, discharging passengers in a steady stream. Your steward, hastily appointed from the Doge's household, announces each arrival with visible bewilderment at the variety.\n\nThe first hour brings what you expected: the curious, the social climbers, the obvious observers. Minor nobles who want to say they dined with a king. Merchants hoping for future advantage. Young men seeking novelty. At least four guests who are almost certainly Council of Ten informants, distinguishable by how carefully they observe while pretending not to.\n\nBut as the evening progresses, the crowd shifts.\n\nThe Catalan\n\nYou notice him before he reaches you—a weathered man in his fifties, dressed well but not extravagantly, with the rolling gait of someone who has spent more of his life on ships than on land. He is studying the room, assessing, calculating. When he approaches you, he does not bow as deeply as the Venetians do.\n\n\"Your Majesty.\" His Castilian is native, though accented with the distinctive cadence of Barcelona. \"I am Pere Descoll, master of the Santa Eulàlia, a carrack of two hundred tons burden, currently lying at anchor in the basin of San Marco.\"\n\nHe glances around at the glittering Venetian company, then back to you.\n\n\"I have a hold half-full of eastern goods and space for more. I was to sail for Barcelona in four days, but my cargo master tells me I can be loaded and ready in two if there is reason. My ship is not Venetian. My contract is not Venetian. I answer to the Consulate of the Sea in Barcelona, not to the Council of Ten.\"\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\"Your Majesty's invitation tonight was... unusual. It allowed me to present myself without asking Venetian permission. I thought Your Majesty might appreciate that.\"\n\nHe waits, hands clasped behind his back, watching you with the direct gaze of a man who has weathered too many storms to waste time on excessive courtesy.",

Horses are... difficult, but not impossible if Your Majesty requires them.\"\n\nHe strokes his grey-streaked beard, calculating.\n\n\"As for compensation—Your Majesty, you are the King of Aragon.

The candlelight catches silk and velvet, gold chains and jeweled rings. The murmur of conversation fills the vaulted space, punctuated by laughter and the clink of silver.\n\nThe Obvious Observers:\nAt least four men circulate with too much purpose, remembering too many details, engaging in conversations designed to extract rather than exchange. Council of Ten, certainly. They are not even trying very hard to hide it—perhaps a message in itself.\n\nThe Merchants:\nA cluster of trading men have gathered near the windows overlooking the canal, talking among themselves in the rapid dialect of Venetian commerce. They glance your way periodically, assessing. One or two have approached to offer greetings but nothing substantive—testing the waters, perhaps waiting to see how the evening develops.\n\nThe Nobles:\nYounger sons, mostly. The great families have not sent their principals—that would be premature, a commitment before the Doge has taken your measure. But they have sent representatives. You count at least three family names you recognize from Italian politics: Contarini, Morosini, Dandolo. Watching, gauging.\n\nThe Curious:\nA scattering of others defy easy categorization. A man in scholar's robes deep in conversation with Father Stanisław—discussing theology, from the gestures. A woman of middle years, richly dressed, who arrived alone and has spoken to no one, simply observing from a corner with sharp, intelligent eyes. An elderly man who Pere Descoll greeted warmly—another captain, perhaps.\n\nOne Man Stands Out:\n\nNear the center of the room, engaged in animated conversation with young László Hunyadi through an interpreter, stands a Venetian noble of perhaps thirty-five years. He is dressed expensively but without ostentation—dark velvet, a single gold chain, no rings. His face is open, his manner warm, and he is laughing at something László has said, a genuine laugh rather than courtly politeness.\n\nAs you watch, he glances up, catches your eye, and inclines his head with a smile that seems to say: I would speak with you, when you have a moment.\n\nThe servants are beginning to direct guests toward the tables.

The question is: what impression do you leave? Do the observers report favorably to the Doge? Do seeds get planted that bear fruit tomorrow? Does anyone approach you privately afterward with something useful?\n\nThe Table\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-5\nCold reception. The room is polite but unmoved. Your speech sounds like every other crusader's rhetoric they have heard—pretty words that mean Venetian gold and Venetian blood for Spanish glory. The toast is drunk in silence. Conversations resume quickly, and you notice guests beginning to leave earlier than courtesy demands. The Council observers smirk to each other. Tomorrow's meeting with the Doge will begin from a position of Venetian skepticism.\n6-12\nCourteous distance. The Venetians raise their cups, echo \"La Serenissima,\" and drink. But the warmth is performative. You have flattered them adequately; you have not moved them. The evening continues pleasantly but no one seeks you out for private conversation. The observers note that you are charming but naive if you think a pretty speech will shift Venetian policy. The Doge will be polite tomorrow, nothing more.\n13-20\nPolite interest. The toast is well-received—the flattery was well-crafted, and Venetians appreciate craft. A few merchants approach afterward to discuss trade opportunities in your kingdoms, carefully avoiding any mention of crusade or Ottomans. The friendly noble who was speaking with László catches your eye again but does not approach. Seeds planted, perhaps, but nothing concrete.\n21-35\nGenuine warmth. Your words have struck a chord with some. The \"Christian trade in the east\" line draws nods from the older merchants who remember when Venice dominated those routes without Ottoman interference. The toast is echoed with real enthusiasm by perhaps half the room. Several guests linger afterward, making themselves available for conversation. The Council observers are taking careful notes—you have made an impression, though whether good or bad remains unclear.\n36-50\nRespect earned. The room recognizes what you have done: a king who speaks their language, flatters without groveling, states his purpose honestly, and asks nothing directly. This is how the game is played. The toast rings out strongly. Afterward, conversations cluster around you. The merchants speak of Naples and Sicily; the nobles probe your intentions with careful questions. The friendly noble approaches to introduce himself properly. You will go to tomorrow's meeting with the Doge having established yourself as someone worth taking seriously.\n51-65\nFavorable impression. Your speech has done more than you hoped. The invocation of \"Christian trade\" awakens old dreams in Venetian hearts—dreams of the routes their grandfathers sailed before Ottoman expansion. Several guests approach with genuine warmth. One merchant mentions, quietly, that he has contacts in Constantinople who might provide useful information. The friendly noble requests a private word. The Council observers are neutral-faced, but you sense they will report that you are shrewd, not merely hopeful. Tomorrow's meeting will begin well.\n66-80\nThe room is yours. Something has shifted. Perhaps it is your Italian, your directness, the specific flattery that showed you truly saw their city. Perhaps it is the weariness of men who have traded with the Ottomans for decades and grown tired of the compromises. The toast becomes a moment—\"LA SERENISSIMA!\" rings from the walls. Afterward, you are surrounded. The friendly noble introduces himself and his family's interests in Naples. A ship captain offers his services. An elderly merchant speaks quietly of Ottoman naval movements he has observed. You have won this room.\n81-90\nA convert appears. The speech moves someone important. The friendly noble—who you now learn is connected to one of the great trading families—draws you aside. He speaks carefully but clearly: not all Venice is content with Ottoman accommodation. There are those who believe the Republic's future lies with Christian alliance, not Turkish sufferance. He cannot speak for the Council, but he can ensure the Doge hears a favorable account of tonight. And he mentions, almost casually, certain intelligence about Ottoman fleet dispositions that might interest you.\n91-95\nThe sharp-eyed woman. After the toast, as guests cluster around you, the woman who has watched silently all evening finally approaches. She is, it emerges, the widow of a great merchant prince—wealthy in her own right, connected to multiple Council families, and possessed of a trading network that spans the eastern Mediterranean. She listened to your speech with the ear of someone who calculates profit and loss. And she has calculated that you might win. She wishes to discuss, privately, how her ships and her information might support your enterprise—for appropriate consideration, of course. This is Venice: even idealism has a price. But the price may be worth paying.\n96-100\nWord reaches the Doge tonight. Your speech does not merely succeed—it resounds. Within the hour, three separate messengers carry accounts to Francesco Foscari. The Doge learns that the Spanish king spoke Italian like a native, honored Venice with specific praise, declared war on the Ottomans with Polish backing, promised Christian trade in the east, and ended with a toast that had hardened merchants cheering. Foscari is a calculating man, but he recognizes a moment when he sees one.

      "text": "The words hang in the candlelit air for a moment.\n\nThen the room responds.\n\n\"LA SERENISSIMA!\"\n\nThe cry comes first from Pere Descoll—the Catalan captain raising his cup with a sailor's bellow—but it is taken up immediately. Cups rise throughout the hall. The merchants, the nobles, even the Council observers (who can hardly refuse to toast their own Republic). The sound fills the vaulted chamber, echoes off the frescoed ceiling, spills out through the windows onto the dark waters of the Grand Canal.\n\nYou see faces flushed with wine and something more. The older merchants especially—men who remember their fathers' stories of Venetian supremacy in the East, before Ottoman galleys made every voyage a negotiation. Christian trade in the east. You have named the thing they have learned not to speak of. The dream they have buried under layers of pragmatism.\n\nThe toast subsides. Conversations resume, but the tenor has changed. There is an energy in the room now, a sense that something has happened, though no one could say precisely what.\n\nGuests begin to approach you.\n\nThe Aftermath\n\nThe next hour is a blur of faces and names. Merchants presenting themselves, probing delicately about trade privileges in Naples and Sicily. A scholar who wishes to discuss your patronage of learning (word of the Great Patronage Program has spread even here). The elderly captain who knows Pere Descoll, offering gruff compliments on your speech. Young nobles who simply want to say they spoke with a king.\n\nYou handle them all with the ease of long practice, giving each enough attention to honor them without committing to anything. The servants keep wine flowing. The food is excellent—Venice has ensured that much.\n\nBut you are aware, throughout, of the friendly noble waiting at the edge of the crowd. He does not push forward. He does not compete for your attention. He simply... waits, with the patience of a man who knows his moment will come.\n\nThe Convert\n\nWhen the crowd finally thins—guests beginning to make their farewells, gondolas clustering again at the water gate—he approaches.\n\nUp close, you can see the intelligence in his eyes, the careful way he moves. This is not a young fool dazzled by a king's presence. This is a man of business and politics, making a calculated decision.\n\n\"Your Majesty.\" His bow is correct, neither servile nor perfunctory. \"I am Marco Venier. My family has traded in the eastern Mediterranean for six generations—Cyprus, Crete, Constantinople itself, before... before things became more complicated.\"\n\nHe glances around. The Council observers are still present, watching from a distance. He pitches his voice for your ears alone.\n\n\"Your speech was... unexpected. Most crusade talk we hear is empty—French princes seeking glory, papal legates seeking tithes. You spoke of trade. Of the East. You understand what Venice has lost.\"\n\nA pause. He chooses his next words carefully.\n\n\"Not all of us are content with accommodation, Your Majesty. There are those among us—families who remember what we were, who calculate what we might be again—who believe the Republic's future lies with Christian alliance rather than Turkish sufferance. We cannot speak openly. The Council watches everything, and policy is policy. But we watch too. We wait. We remember.\"\n\nHe meets your eyes directly.\n\n\"The Doge will receive you tomorrow. He is a careful man, and Venice does not commit quickly. But I can ensure he hears a favorable account of tonight. And I can offer you something more immediate.\"\n\nAnother glance at the observers. His voice drops further.\n\n\"My family's factors in Constantinople report that the Ottoman fleet is not what it was. Murad neglects his navy—he cares for hunting, for poetry, not for ships. The arsenals at Gallipoli have been allowed to decline. Timber rots in the yards. Experienced captains have retired or died without replacement. If a Christian fleet were to challenge Ottoman waters in the next two years... they would find the Sultan less prepared than anyone in Christendom believes.\"\n\nHe lets that hang in the air for a moment.\n\n\"I tell you this freely, Your Majesty. A gift between potential friends. What you do with it is your affair.\"\n\nHe pauses, and something flickers across his face—ambition, perhaps, or hope, or simply the hunger of a man who has waited a long time for something to change.\n\n\"If your crusade succeeds... if Christian trade returns to the East... Venice will need friends who remember who stood with them in the dark years. And those friends will need Venetians who know the eastern waters.\"\n\nHe inclines his head slightly.\n\n\"I have taken enough of Your Majesty's time. But if you wish to speak further—tonight, or before you depart—I am at your service.\"",

I should not have invented intelligence suggesting the navy is in decline - that contradicts what was established.\n\nLet me correct this and proceed with Juan going to sleep and meeting the Doge the next day.\n\nYou're right—I apologize for the contradiction. The strategic assessment established that while Murad is complacent, his professional officers maintain readiness. I should not have invented intelligence contradicting that.\n\nMarco Venier bows, a genuine smile crossing his features.\n\n\"Your Majesty is most gracious. I shall make myself available.\"\n\nHe withdraws into the thinning crowd, and you see him exchange a few words with László Hunyadi before departing—maintaining the connection he had begun earlier.\n\nNight at Ca' Foscari\n\nThe last guests depart. The gondolas slip away into the darkness, their lanterns bobbing like fireflies on the black water. The servants begin clearing the hall with quiet efficiency.\n\nYou find your chambers on the upper floor—luxurious beyond anything strictly necessary, with windows overlooking the Grand Canal. The bed is soft, the linens fine, the silence broken only by the gentle lap of water against stone.\n\nPere Descoll has confirmed: the Santa Eulàlia will be ready at dawn the day after tomorrow.\n\nYou sleep.\n\nOctober 7, 1439 — Morning\n\nYou wake to grey light filtering through the windows and the smell of the lagoon. A servant has laid out fresh clothes—Venetian tailors worked through the night, it seems, to provide something more suitable than your travel-worn garments. A small courtesy, or a subtle message about Venetian standards.\n\nBreakfast is brought: bread, cheese, olives, cold fish, wine watered in the Italian fashion. Your men are stirring throughout the palazzo. Father Stanisław has already said morning Mass in the chapel; the Polish and Hungarian knights attended.\n\nAt the appointed hour, a delegation arrives to escort you to the Doge's Palace. Liveried servants, a gondola draped in scarlet, the banner of San Marco snapping in the morning breeze.\n\nThe journey across the water is brief. The Doge's Palace rises before you—pink and white stone, Gothic arches, the winged lion of Saint Mark gazing down from every corner. You are led through courtyards, up staircases, past guards in ceremonial armor, through antechambers where clerks scratch at ledgers and officials murmur in corners.\n\nFinally, you are brought to a reception chamber. Not the great hall—this is smaller, more intimate. A room for serious conversation rather than ceremony.\n\nFrancesco Foscari, Doge of Venice, rises from a chair near the window.\n\nHe is older than you expected—perhaps seventy, his face lined and weathered, his beard white. But his eyes are sharp, and he moves with the careful energy of a man who has outlasted many rivals. He wears the corno, the distinctive horned cap of his office, and robes of crimson and gold.\n\n\"Your Majesty.\" His voice is strong, carrying easily across the chamber. \"Welcome to Venice. I trust the Ca' Foscari proved comfortable?\"\n\nHe gestures to a chair opposite his own. Between them, a small table holds wine, water, and a bowl of figs.\n\n\"Please. Sit. We have much to discuss, and I am told your ship departs tomorrow at dawn. Let us not waste the time God has given us.\"\n\nHe settles back into his chair, studying you with eyes that have measured kings and princes for five decades.\n\n\"Your dinner last night has been the talk of the city this morning. An unusual approach. My councillors are not certain what to make of it—or of you.\"\n\nA thin smile.\n\n\"I find myself curious as well.\"",

Marco Venier is to be contacted through appropriate intermediaries—not directly connected to you, but brought into Isaac de Baeza's network through channels that provide deniability for both parties. A Venetian merchant with eastern connections and sympathy for Christian alliance could prove valuable. Isaac will know how to handle it.\n\nPERSUASION: The Doge's Position\n\nEvaluation of Factors\n\nSuccess Factors:\n\nLast night's dinner was a triumph (Roll: 89)—the Doge has heard favorable reports\n\nYou speak Italian, demonstrating cultivation and respect\n\nThe flattery is gracious without being excessive\n\nYou reference Thessaloniki—Venice lost it to the Ottomans in 1430, a wound that still festers\n\nYou are direct and honest about your purpose; Venetians respect clarity\n\nYou do not demand commitment, merely inquire—leaving him room to maneuver\n\nYou rule Naples and Sicily—you are Venice's neighbor and potential partner in the Adriatic\n\nThe crusade has Polish-Hungarian backing; this is not a Spanish fantasy\n\nYour Constantinople garrison makes you a genuine eastern Mediterranean power\n\nFailure Factors:\n\nVenice trades extensively with the Ottomans—war means commercial disruption\n\nFoscari has ruled for nearly two decades by being cautious; he does not gamble\n\nVenice's official policy is neutrality; the Doge cannot reverse this in a private conversation\n\nThe Council of Ten constrains even the Doge's freedom of action\n\nVenice has seen crusades fail before—they will not back a losing cause\n\nYour urgency to leave (ship tomorrow) limits what can be negotiated\n\nThe strategic assessment showed Venice \"hedging all bets\" (Roll: 42)—this is institutional, not personal\n\nCommitting to you means risking Ottoman retaliation if the crusade fails\n\nAssessment:\nThe Doge will not pledge Venetian ships or soldiers in this conversation—that is beyond his power and contrary to Venice's nature. The question is: how much does he reveal? Does he hint at future support? Share intelligence? Leave doors open? Or does he give you polished diplomatic nothing?\n\nThe Table\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-8\nDiplomatic stone wall. The Doge's face becomes a mask. \"The Most Serene Republic values peace with all Christian and Muslim powers. We trade where trade is possible. We fight where fighting is necessary. Your Majesty's war is your own affair; Venice wishes you well but cannot entangle herself in conflicts beyond her interests.\" The conversation continues politely but yields nothing. He is cordial, even warm, but you leave with no more than you came with. Venice will watch from the sidelines.\n9-18\nPolite deflection. Foscari acknowledges Thessaloniki with a pained nod—yes, it was a loss. But he speaks of \"practical realities\" and \"the Republic's many interests.\" He wishes you success, hints that Venice would welcome Ottoman weakness, but commits to nothing. You sense he is genuinely uncertain whether your crusade can succeed, and Venice does not bet on uncertainty. The door is not closed, but neither is it open.\n19-30\nCautious interest. The Doge studies you carefully as you speak. \"Thessaloniki,\" he repeats quietly. \"Yes. We remember.\" He admits that Venice would benefit from reduced Ottoman power—this is hardly secret—but explains that the Republic cannot openly support a crusade while maintaining eastern trade. However, he notes that private Venetian citizens might make their own decisions about where to invest their ships and coin. A hint, but only a hint.\n31-45\nHonest assessment. Foscari decides you deserve a frank answer. \"Your Majesty asks Venice's position. I will tell you: we have no position. We wait. We watch. If your crusade succeeds, Venice will be your friend—we will trade in Christian waters as we once did. If it fails, we will continue as we are, accommodating Ottoman power because we must.\" He pauses. \"Convince me you can win, and this conversation changes. But I have seen crusades before. Brave words in Rome, disaster in the field. Why should yours be different?\" A challenge, but also an opening—he is willing to be convinced.\n46-60\nThe wound acknowledged. At the mention of Thessaloniki, something flickers in the old Doge's eyes. \"I was a younger man when we lost that city. I remember the debates in the Council—whether to fight, whether to yield. We yielded. We had no choice.\" His voice hardens slightly. \"The Republic does not forget. But neither does she act rashly.\" He leans forward. \"Tell me of your alliance. Tell me of your forces. Tell me why a King of Castile cares about the East. If I am to carry anything to my Council, I must understand what I am carrying.\" He is listening—truly listening.\n61-75\nStrategic candor. The Doge makes a decision. \"Your Majesty, I will speak plainly, as one ruler to another. Venice cannot join your crusade openly—our trade with the Ottomans is too valuable, and we cannot risk retaliation unless we are certain of victory. But neither are we content with Turkish dominance.\" He rises, moves to the window overlooking the lagoon. \"If your war goes well—if you bloody Murad's nose in Serbia, if you demonstrate that Christian arms can match Ottoman—then Venice will reconsider her position. We are not your enemy. We are... observers, waiting for a sign.\" He turns back. \"Give us that sign, Your Majesty, and you may find the Republic more forthcoming than you expect.\"\n76-85\nIntelligence shared. Foscari's eyes narrow thoughtfully. \"Thessaloniki. Yes.\" A long pause. \"Your Majesty should know that Venice maintains... sources throughout the Ottoman lands. We know things that perhaps you do not.\" He proceeds to share genuinely useful intelligence: the disposition of Ottoman forces in the Balkans, the names of provincial governors, the state of fortifications in Serbia. Nothing that commits Venice, but information that could save lives and shape strategy. \"Consider this a gesture of goodwill,\" he says. \"Venice wishes to see how you use it.\"\n86-93\nA private understanding. The Doge leans close, his voice dropping. \"What I tell you now, I tell you as Francesco Foscari, not as Doge of Venice. The Council does not know I speak thus.\" He explains that there is a faction in Venice—merchants, nobles, even some Council members—who believe the Republic's future lies with Christian alliance, not Ottoman accommodation. They cannot act openly, but they watch your crusade with hope. If you succeed in Serbia, if you prove the Ottomans can be beaten, this faction will push for Venetian intervention. \"Win your first battle, Your Majesty. Win it decisively. And you may find Venetian sails on your horizon sooner than the Sultan expects.\"\n94-97\nConditional commitment. Foscari is silent for a long moment after you finish speaking. Then: \"You ask Venice's position. I will tell you what I cannot tell my own Council yet.\" He explains that he has been quietly preparing for this moment—stockpiling naval supplies, maintaining galley crews at readiness, keeping the Arsenal productive despite the official peace. \"If your crusade reaches Constantinople—if you truly threaten Ottoman control of the straits—Venice will act. Not for God, not for Christendom, but for the trade routes we lost. I cannot promise this publicly. But I give you my word as a man who has ruled this Republic for nineteen years: free the straits, and Venice joins you.\"\n98-100\nThe Lion stirs. The Doge rises, moves to a cabinet, and produces a rolled map. He spreads it on the table between you—the eastern Mediterranean, marked with annotations in a secretary's careful hand. \"Your Majesty spoke of Thessaloniki. Let me show you what else we have lost. What we remember. What we want back.\" For the next hour, Francesco Foscari—seventy years old, five decades in Venetian politics—speaks with the passion of a young man describing his dreams. He outlines a vision: Christian control of the Aegean, Venetian dominance restored, the Straits open to Christian trade. He cannot commit the Republic formally, not yet. But he makes clear that if your crusade shows real success, Venice will not merely join—Venice will help you finish the job. He provides intelligence, suggests strategies, identifies Ottoman weaknesses. When you leave, you carry more than goodwill. You carry the knowledge that Venice's greatest statesman is waiting for you to succeed.\n\nRoll when ready.",

His face, schooled by decades of Venetian politics, reveals little—but you see his fingers tighten almost imperceptibly on the arm of his chair.\n\n\"Thessaloniki,\" he repeats quietly. The name hangs in the air between you.\n\nHe rises from his chair—slowly, the movement of an old man whose joints protest but whose will remains iron—and walks to the window. For a long moment he stands there, looking out at the lagoon, at the ships riding at anchor, at the city he has ruled for nineteen years.\n\nWhen he speaks again, his voice is different. Lower. The formal cadence of diplomatic discourse has fallen away.\n\n\"Your Majesty, what I tell you now, I tell you as Francesco Foscari—not as Doge of Venice. The Council does not know I speak thus. If you were to repeat my words, I would deny them, and you would be thought a liar.\"\n\nHe turns back to face you.\n\n\"You ask the position of the Most Serene Republic. Officially, we have no position. We trade with the Ottoman. We maintain our colonies in the East through accommodation and tribute. We swallow our pride because pride does not fill merchant holds or pay Arsenal workers.\"\n\nHis jaw tightens.\n\n\"But you mentioned Thessaloniki. I was fifty-three years old when that city fell.

I have made peace with the Turk because I had no choice. I have smiled at Ottoman ambassadors and pretended that their Sultan's boot on our throat was a friendly embrace. I have done what the Republic required.\"\n\nHis eyes meet yours—and in them you see something you did not expect. Not the calculating statesman. Something older. Angrier. More human.\n\n\"But I have not forgotten. And I am not alone.\"\n\nHe leans forward, his voice dropping further.\n\n\"There is a faction in Venice—merchants who lost fortunes when the eastern routes closed, nobles whose families held lands we have since surrendered, Council members who remember what we were before we learned to grovel. They cannot act openly. The peace party controls the Council; the trade with Constantinople is too valuable to risk. But they watch. They wait. They hope.\"\n\nA pause.\n\n\"They watch you, Your Majesty. Word of your garrison in Constantinople reached us years ago. Your declaration of war, co-signed by Poland—that was noted. Your dinner last night, your speech about Christian trade in the East—by this morning, half the merchants in the Rialto were discussing it.\"\n\nHe spreads his hands.\n\n\"I cannot promise you Venetian galleys. I cannot promise you Venetian gold. The Council would not permit it, and even if they did, Venice does not bet on uncertain ventures. We have seen crusades before. We have seen them fail.\"\n\nHis voice hardens.\n\n\"But I tell you this: if you succeed in Serbia—if you bloody Murad's nose, if you prove that Christian arms can match Ottoman in the field—then everything changes. The faction I speak of will no longer be a faction. They will be the majority. And Venice will act.\"\n\nHe leans back.\n\n\"Win your first battle, Your Majesty. Win it decisively. Let the word spread through every trading house from here to Alexandria that the Sultan is not invincible. And you may find Venetian sails on your horizon sooner than Murad expects.\"\n\nThe old Doge studies you with those sharp, tired eyes.\n\n\"That is the position of Venice—the true position, which I have never spoken aloud to any foreign prince. Do with it what you will. But do not fail. For if you fail, this conversation never happened, and Venice will continue as she has—making peace with whoever holds the whip.\"\n\nHe gestures to the wine on the table between you.\n\n\"Now. You said your ship departs tomorrow at dawn. Tell me more of this alliance you have built. Poland, Hungary, Castile—and what of the Pope? What of Genoa? What forces will you actually bring to the field? If I am to hope, Your Majesty, I would know what I am hoping for.\"",

Poland and Hungary, committed by young Władysław. The Military Orders maintaining your garrison at Constantinople. The Pope's blessing sought and expected.\n\nYou do not mention Serbia.

You introduce Marco Venier to the Polish and Hungarian knights as promised—a social connection that your intermediaries will quietly deepen into something more useful. László Hunyadi seems genuinely pleased to see the Venetian again.\n\nPere Descoll has been true to his word. The Santa Eulàlia rides at anchor in the basin of San Marco, loaded and ready. Two hundred tons of Catalan oak and canvas, her crew scrambling through final preparations as your party arrives at the quay.\n\nYour men—the forty you are taking—board with the efficiency of soldiers who have learned not to waste time. The Polish and Hungarian knights eye the ship with the wariness of landsmen, but they do not complain. Father Stanisław blesses the vessel before stepping aboard.\n\nThe rest of your party—the servants, officials, the bulk of your escort—will follow on slower vessels or overland. They will reach Castile weeks after you.\n\nAs the oarsmen maneuver the Santa Eulàlia out of the harbor, you stand at the stern rail and watch Venice recede. The pink and white facades. The campanile of San Marco. The Doge's Palace where, less than a day ago, the most powerful man in the Republic spoke treason to you in a whisper.\n\nThen the lagoon opens into the Adriatic, the sails catch the morning wind, and Venice falls behind.\n\nTHE VOYAGE HOME — Venice to Toledo\n\nRoute:\n\nVenice → down the Adriatic coast → around the boot of Italy → through the Strait of Messina → along the southern coast → across the western Mediterranean → Barcelona\n\nBarcelona → overland to Toledo\n\nDistance:\n\nVenice to Barcelona by sea: ~1,200-1,400 nautical miles\n\nBarcelona to Toledo by land: ~350 miles\n\nExpected Duration:\n\nSea voyage: 10-14 days in good conditions, longer with weather delays\n\nOverland: 6-8 days riding hard\n\nEarliest Possible Arrival in Toledo: Late October\nLikely Arrival: Early November\nIf Delayed: Mid-to-late November\n\nFactors in Play\n\nFOR a swift voyage:\n\nPere Descoll is an experienced captain who knows these waters\n\nThe Santa Eulàlia is a sound vessel, well-maintained\n\nYou have paid for speed and Descoll is motivated\n\nEarly October is still within the sailing season\n\nThe autumn westerlies can favor an east-to-west Mediterranean crossing\n\nOnce in Barcelona, you are in your own kingdom—no delays for diplomacy\n\nAGAINST a swift voyage:\n\nAutumn storms are increasingly likely as October progresses\n\nThe Strait of Messina can be treacherous\n\nContrary winds could slow progress significantly\n\nBarbary corsairs operate along the North African coast (though unlikely to challenge a well-armed carrack)\n\nThe Santa Eulàlia is a merchant vessel, not a war galley—she cannot row through calms\n\nIllness at sea is always possible\n\nThe Journey Table\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-5\nSerious trouble. A major autumn storm catches you in open water—or the Strait of Messina lives up to its evil reputation. Days lost to contrary winds, damage to rigging or hull, perhaps injury among the crew or your men. You limp into Barcelona three weeks after departure, exhausted and delayed. Then hard riding to Toledo. Arrival: Early-to-mid November. The conspiracy has had time to develop further.\n6-12\nDifficult passage. Persistent contrary winds, a minor storm that forces you to shelter in a port for two days, calms that leave you drifting. Descoll curses the weather but keeps the ship moving. The voyage takes eighteen days instead of twelve. Arrival: Late October/Early November. You have lost precious time but nothing catastrophic.\n13-25\nSlower than hoped. The weather is not terrible but not favorable either. Variable winds, a day of calm, one night of hard rain that makes everyone miserable. Descoll does his best. The voyage takes fifteen days. The ride from Barcelona to Toledo is uneventful. Arrival: Late October.\n26-45\nRoutine voyage. The Mediterranean shows her autumn face—grey skies, choppy seas, winds that shift unpredictably—but nothing Descoll cannot handle. Twelve days to Barcelona, seven days riding to Toledo. Arrival: October 27-28. You return before the conspirators expect you, but not dramatically so.\n46-65\nGood passage. The winds favor you. Descoll finds the currents he knows from years of this route. The Santa Eulàlia makes good time through the Strait of Messina and across the western Mediterranean. Eleven days to Barcelona, six days hard riding to Toledo. Arrival: October 25-26. Luna will be relieved to see you.\n66-80\nSwift voyage. Excellent conditions—the autumn westerlies arrive early and blow steady from the east, pushing you across the Mediterranean like a blessing. Descoll grins and says he has rarely seen better. Ten days to Barcelona; five days of hard riding on royal post horses. Arrival: October 23-24. You catch the conspirators off-guard; they did not expect you for weeks yet.\n81-90\nExceptional speed. Everything aligns: perfect winds, clear skies, smooth passage through Messina, favorable currents. Descoll calls it the finest autumn crossing of his career. Nine days to Barcelona. You commandeer the fastest horses in Aragon and ride day and night, changing mounts at every royal post. Arrival: October 20-21. You appear in Toledo like a ghost—no one knew you were even close.\n91-95\nBlessed journey. The voyage is almost supernaturally swift—eight days to Barcelona with winds that never falter. In Aragon, word of your coming spreads ahead of you; fresh horses wait at every stop, crowds cheer as you pass. Arrival: October 18-19. You return so quickly that rumors in Toledo have barely begun to circulate about troubles. The conspirators are caught completely unprepared.\n96-100\nProvidence. Seven days to Barcelona—Descoll shakes his head in disbelief and says the saints themselves must be filling your sails. In Aragon, the royal post system performs flawlessly. And somewhere on the road, you encounter unexpected intelligence: a loyal vassal, a fleeing servant of the conspirators, or a letter meant for other eyes. Arrival: October 16-17. You return not only faster than anyone believed possible, but armed with specific information about the conspiracy's current state.\n\nRoll when ready.",

      "text": "The Adriatic — October 8-12, 1439\n\nThe first days go well enough. The Santa Eulàlia catches a fair wind out of Venice and makes good progress down the Adriatic coast. The Croatian islands slide past to port—grey shapes in the autumn haze. Pere Descoll stands at the helm, reading the sky with the ease of long practice.\n\nThen the wind dies.\n\nFor two days you drift in glassy calm, the sails hanging limp, the crew cursing quietly as they man the sweeps to keep some headway. The Mediterranean in autumn is capricious; everyone knows this. But knowing does not make the waiting easier.\n\nOn the third day of calm, clouds begin to build on the western horizon.\n\nThe Storm — October 13-15, 1439\n\nIt is not a great storm—not the kind that sinks ships and drowns crews. But it is bad enough. The wind comes howling out of the west, directly against your course, driving sheets of rain before it. The Santa Eulàlia pitches and rolls, her timbers groaning.\n\nDescoll makes the call: shelter.\n\nYou put into Ragusa—the fortified city-state that clings to the Dalmatian coast, nominally independent, practically a vassal of whoever currently holds the whip in the region. The harbor master eyes your Spanish colors with suspicion but accepts your gold readily enough.\n\nTwo days you wait, watching the rain hammer the harbor, watching the sky for any sign of clearing. The Polish and Hungarian knights are miserable—young László Hunyadi spends most of the time below decks, his face green. Father Stanisław prays for deliverance and calm seas.\n\nOn the third morning, the clouds break. Descoll rouses the crew before dawn.\n\nThe Western Mediterranean — October 16-26, 1439\n\nThe rest of the voyage is a grinding battle against contrary winds.\n\nThe Strait of Messina is passable but unpleasant—cross-currents that make the helmsman earn his pay, Descoll shouting orders as the ship threads between Scylla and Charybdis. Sicily slides past to starboard, its mountains brown and dry in the autumn light.\n\nThen the open western Mediterranean, and the winds that should be pushing you toward Spain are instead blowing fitfully from the west and southwest, as if God Himself is testing your patience.\n\nDescoll tacks endlessly, zigzagging across the sea to make any westward progress at all. Some days you cover fifty miles. Some days you cover twenty. The crew grows surly; even their experienced captain's good humor begins to fray.\n\nThe food holds out. The water holds out. No one falls seriously ill. But the days stretch into weeks, and every sunset finds you still at sea, still fighting for every league toward home.\n\nBarcelona — October 26, 1439\n\nEighteen days after leaving Venice, the Santa Eulàlia limps into Barcelona harbor.\n\nYou stand at the rail as the city comes into view—the familiar skyline, the cathedral tower, the crowded wharves of the greatest port in Aragon. Your kingdom. Your city now, inherited from Alfonso.\n\nPere Descoll joins you, his face weathered and tired.\n\n\"Eighteen days, Your Majesty. I have made the crossing in ten. But the sea gives what the sea gives.\"\n\nHe hesitates, then adds:\n\n\"The Santa Eulàlia will need minor repairs—nothing serious, but the rigging took strain in that blow off Messina. If Your Majesty ever has need of a ship again...\"\n\nHe leaves the offer hanging.\n\nThe Ride to Toledo — October 27 - November 3, 1439\n\nYou do not linger in Barcelona.\n\nWithin hours of landing, you have commandeered horses from the royal stables—the best available, with orders sent ahead to prepare fresh mounts at every post station. Your forty men follow as best they can; you ride with only a dozen of the hardest riders, the ones who can match your pace.\n\nThe Polish and Hungarian knights, to their credit, keep up. László Hunyadi rides as if demons pursue him, his seasickness forgotten now that he is back on solid ground.\n\nThe road from Barcelona crosses Aragon into Castile—through Zaragoza, through Calatayud, through the mountain passes and across the high Castilian plateau. You know this road. You have ridden it before, in better times.\n\nNow you ride it with dread in your heart.\n\nEvery post station, you ask for news from Toledo. The answers are vague, troubling. \"All is well, Your Majesty.\" But the eyes of the messengers say otherwise. Something is wrong. No one wants to be the one to tell you.\n\nToledo — November 3, 1439, Late Afternoon\n\nYou see the city from miles away—the ancient fortress on its rocky promontory, the Tagus curving around it like a protective arm, the spires of the cathedral rising against the grey November sky.\n\nHome.\n\nYou ride through the gates in the failing light, your escort reduced to eight men, the others strung out along the road behind you. The guards at the gate recognize you—there is a moment of stunned silence, then shouting, trumpets, the word spreading through the streets like fire.\n\nThe King has returned.\n\nThe King has returned.\n\nPeople emerge from houses, from taverns, from workshops. They line the streets as you ride toward the Alcázar. Some cheer. Some simply stare. You see relief on some faces. Fear on others. Uncertainty on most.\n\nAt the gates of the Alcázar, Álvaro de Luna is waiting.\n\nHe looks older than when you left. Thinner. There are shadows under his eyes that were not there before. He wears a sword at his hip—Luna, who never wore a sword inside the palace walls.\n\nAs you dismount, he bows—the deep bow of a subject to his king. But when he rises, his eyes meet yours, and in them you see exhaustion, relief, and something else.\n\nWarning.\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" he says, his voice carefully controlled. \"Thank God you have returned. There is much we must discuss.\"\n\nHe glances at the servants, the guards, the growing crowd of courtiers emerging to greet you.\n\n\"In private, Your Majesty. As soon as possible.\"",

The courtiers are turned away with polite firmness.\n\nThe door closes.\n\nYou are in your private study—the room where you have made a hundred decisions that shaped kingdoms. The fire has been lit; candles burn on the desk. Through the windows, the last light fades over Toledo.\n\nÁlvaro de Luna stands before you. For a moment, neither of you speaks.\n\nThen Luna exhales—a long, slow breath, as if releasing a weight he has carried for months.\n\n\"Your Majesty. I will be direct. We do not have time for courtly language.\"\n\nHe moves to the desk, where a sheaf of papers lies waiting. His hand rests on them but does not lift them.\n\n\"In August, my agents began to notice... irregularities. Tax shipments from Extremadura delayed without explanation. Royal summons to minor lords answered with excuses. Correspondence between certain noble houses that my informants could not intercept. Small things, individually. Together, a pattern.\"\n\nHe looks up at you.\n\n\"By September, I knew. The Stúñigas are moving against me. Pedro de Stúñiga, Count of Plasencia, is the center of it. He has been meeting with other lords—quietly, in hunting lodges and remote estates. Building something.\"\n\nLuna's jaw tightens.\n\n\"I do not know everyone involved. But I know some.

It seems I was wrong. Or perhaps I underestimated how much the nobility despises me.\"\n\nHe picks up the papers now, shuffles through them.\n\n\"I have evidence, but not proof. Letters that suggest but do not confirm. Witnesses who heard things but cannot swear to them in court. If I move against these men openly, they will deny everything, and half the nobility will rally to them against the 'tyrant Luna' persecuting innocent lords.\"\n\nHe sets the papers down again.\n\n\"They have not struck yet. I believe they were waiting—either for Your Majesty's return, to present their grievances formally, or for some moment of weakness they could exploit.

He knows Stúñigas are moving, suspects Manriques, has heard whispers about the Admiral. But he doesn't know they want him dead.\n\nSo Luna should tell Juan what he knows - but he doesn't know the full extent. He doesn't know their goal is his death, specifically. He should be uncertain about that.\n\nLet me have Luna respond with what he knows.\n\nLuna nods grimly, as if expecting the question.\n\n\"Three names I am certain of, Your Majesty.\"\n\nHe counts them on his fingers.\n\n\"Pedro de Stúñiga, Count of Plasencia. He is the center—the spider in the web. The Stúñigas have always believed they should stand where I stand. They were Trastámara loyalists in the civil wars; they think that loyalty should have been rewarded with power at court. Instead, they have watched a bastard of minor Aragonese nobility\"—he gestures to himself without self-pity—\"hold the King's ear for thirty years. Pedro is patient, clever, and controls much of Extremadura. He has been building toward this for a long time. Your prolonged absence gave him his moment.\"\n\nA second finger.\n\n\"Rodrigo Manrique, Count of Paredes. The Manriques have hated me since before Your Majesty was born. Old feuds, old slights, old wounds that never healed. Rodrigo is not the schemer that Stúñiga is—he is a soldier, blunt and proud. But his hatred is pure, and he brings military strength to the conspiracy. His lands in the north give them reach beyond Extremadura.\"\n\nA third finger.\n\n\"Fadrique Enríquez, Admiral of Castile.\"\n\nLuna's voice tightens on this name.\n\n\"This one... I did not expect. The Enríquez family has held the Admiralty for generations. Fadrique is wealthy, respected, considered an honorable man. But he has chafed under my influence over naval affairs—Your Majesty's maritime union with Portugal, the fleet reorganization, the appointments I have made in your name. He wants the Admiralty to mean what it once meant: independent command of Castile's sea power.\"\n\nLuna spreads his hands.\n\n\"There may be others. Almost certainly there are others—lesser lords, younger sons, men with grievances I do not even know. But these three are the pillars. Remove them, and the conspiracy collapses. Fail to remove them, and...\"\n\nHe does not finish the sentence.\n\n\"As for what they want...\"\n\nHe pauses, choosing his words carefully.\n\n\"Publicly? They will demand my removal from court. They will call me a tyrant, a corruptor of royal justice, a low-born upstart who has poisoned Your Majesty's ear against the true nobility of Castile. They will present petitions, demand a hearing before the Cortes, wrap themselves in the language of ancient rights and noble privileges.\"\n\nHis eyes harden.\n\n\"Privately? I do not know for certain, Your Majesty. But the Manriques do not scheme for half-measures. And Stúñiga has not spent years building this coalition merely to see me retire to my estates in comfort.\"\n\nHe meets your gaze directly.\n\n\"I believe they want me dead. Whether by trial, by assassination, or by some convenient accident—I cannot say. But men do not go to such lengths merely to see an enemy diminished. They go to such lengths to see an enemy destroyed.\"\n\nA long pause.\n\n\"I may be wrong. Perhaps they will be satisfied with my exile. Perhaps Enríquez, at least, seeks only power, not blood. But I would not wager my life on it.\"\n\nHe waits for your response.",

A strength because they cannot claim to oppose the legitimate king—they have no rival candidate, no pretender, no legal basis for rebellion. They must frame this as loyal nobles seeking to free Your Majesty from an evil counselor. The moment they move against the crown itself, they become traitors, and they know it.\"\n\nA grimmer note enters his voice.\n\n\"But it is also a danger because it gives them cover. Half the nobility of Castile may dislike me without disliking Your Majesty. Men who would never rebel against their king might stand aside—or even join—a movement to remove an 'upstart' from power. They can tell themselves they are helping the crown, not opposing it.\"\n\nHe nods slowly at your order.\n\n\"I will go, Your Majesty.

A few.\"\n\nHe ticks them off with the efficiency of a man who has kept a kingdom running in his master's absence.\n\n\"First: Her Majesty the Queen.

He would not tell me the details—only that something significant has developed in Granada. He used the word 'extraordinary.' I do not know more than that.\"\n\nHe glances toward the window, where full darkness has now fallen.\n\n\"Fourth: The treasury. It remains healthy. Diego de Daza has the full accounts, but the short version is that your absence has not strained our finances. The silver continues to flow from the Sierra Nevada. The reforms continue to yield fruit.\"\n\nA pause.\n\n\"That is all that cannot wait until morning, Your Majesty.

      "text": "The journey to Poland seems to have started around July 1439 when he was in Florence. But when did he actually leave Castile/Toledo?\n\nLooking at the memory and chapter summaries:\n- Chapter 2.54 mentions the journey: Florence → Venice → Alps → Moravia (difficult) → Poland\n- The Medici banking agreement was signed July 28, 1439\n\nSo Juan must have left Toledo sometime before late July 1439 to reach Florence by then. Perhaps he left in June or early July 1439?\n\nLet me check if there's more specific information in the summaries I have access to.\n\nThe CHARACTER_DATABASE mentions:\n- \"Juan visited Barcelona Spring 1437, saw Alfonso's declining health\"\n- Current location is Kraków as of the Chapter 2.54 update\n\nThe Chapter 2.55 summary says Juan was in Kraków September 8-12, 1439, and departed September 12.\n\nSo the timeline seems to be:\n- Left Toledo: probably June or early July 1439\n- Florence (Medici meeting): late July 1439\n- Ferrara, Venice, Alps, Moravia: August 1439\n- Kraków: September 1439\n\nIf Lucia conceived in August/September 1439, Juan would have been away already. The conception would have happened before he left, or... wait, that doesn't work either.\n\nActually, if he left in June/July and Lucia conceived in August/September, that's a problem - he wouldn't have been there.\n\nBut the CHARACTER_DATABASE notes Lucia will conceive in August/September 1439, which creates a timing conflict if he departed in summer. This suggests he may have left later than I initially thought—perhaps in late September or October 1439, after Lucia's conception, making the journey to Poland much shorter than the multi-month route through Florence and Venice would indicate.\n\nHowever, Chapter 2.54 shows Juan meeting Władysław in Kraków by September 1439, meaning he must have arrived there by early September at the latest. Working backward from that meeting, if the journey took several months, he would have needed to depart Toledo around June or July 1439. The pregnancy dating likely reflects approximations common to medieval records—if Lucia is due in May/June 1440 and it's currently November 1439, she'd be about 4-5 months along, suggesting conception around June or July rather than August or September. So Juan probably left for Poland in the summer of 1439, making his absence roughly 4-5 months by November.\n\nLooking at the timeline from the chapter summaries:\n\nChapter 2.54 shows Juan meeting Cosimo de' Medici in Florence in late July 1439 (the Conventio Bancaria Medici was signed July 28, 1439)\n\nThe journey then went: Florence → Ferrara → Venice → Alps → Moravia → Poland\n\nChapter 2.55 shows Juan in Kraków September 8-12, 1439\n\nSo Juan must have left Toledo sometime in late June or early July 1439 to reach Florence by late July.\n\nThat means you have been away approximately four months (July through early November).\n\nIf Lucia conceived in August/September 1439 as the database states, that timing is impossible—you were already gone.\n\nThis needs correction. Either:\n\nLucia conceived just before you left (late June), making her now 4-5 months pregnant (due around February/March 1440)\n\nThe conception date in the database is an error and she is not pregnant at all\n\nSome other explanation\n\nWhich would you prefer to be accurate for the narrative? Or shall we roll to determine whether Lucia is pregnant and how far along?",

The servants scatter before you, word racing ahead: the King comes.\n\nThe guards at the door to the Queen's chambers straighten as you approach. One moves to announce you, but you wave him aside. You do not need to be announced in your own house.\n\nThe door opens.\n\nThe room is warm, a fire burning in the hearth against the November chill. Candles illuminate tapestries you know well—scenes of hunting, of courtly love, of the Virgin and Child. The smell of the place is familiar: beeswax, dried lavender, the faint sweetness of the perfume Lucia favors.\n\nShe is sitting near the fire, a book open in her lap. Her dark hair is loose, falling past her shoulders. The swell of her pregnancy is visible now beneath her gown—six months along, the physicians say, the child growing strong.\n\nAt the sound of the door, she looks up.\n\nFor a moment, neither of you moves. Four months since you last saw her. Four months of hard travel, of diplomacy, of alliances forged and dangers faced. Four months of managing a household, a pregnancy, a kingdom's whispers, alone.\n\nThen her face transforms—relief, joy, something fierce and protective all at once. The book falls forgotten from her lap as she rises, one hand moving instinctively to her belly.\n\n\"Juan.\"\n\nJust your name. Nothing more.\n\nBehind her, through a half-open door, you can hear the sounds of the nursery—a child's voice, a nurse's murmur. Your children. All six of them, sleeping or being readied for bed, unaware that their father has returned.\n\nLucia crosses the room toward you, her grey-green eyes bright in the firelight.",

The road is familiar, even in the darkness—you have ridden it countless times.\n\nCasa de Palomas lies a short distance from the city walls, a modest estate that has become something more: a home. Not the cold formality of the Alcázar, but a place where children can run in gardens, where the Queen can walk without a hundred eyes upon her, where the royal family can simply be.\n\nThe torches at the gate flare as your party approaches.

Nicolás, the youngest, shows commanding instincts and legendary martial potential despite his tender age, with no particular special talents yet to speak of.\n\nI should have each child wake and react to their father's presence in ways that reflect who they are—Juana's magnetism and intelligence shining through, Nicolás displaying that commanding nature even as a small boy.

But you are explaining everything after.\"\n\nTHE CHILDREN\n\nCasa de Palomas — November 3, 1439, Late Night\n\nThe nurses are flustered at first—waking the royal children at this hour?—but a word from Lucia silences their protests. Servants bustle to light fires in the main sitting room, to bring blankets and warm milk, to make the space ready.\n\nOne by one, the children are brought down.\n\nPrincess Catalina, age 7\n\nShe comes first, already half-awake—she heard the commotion and demanded to know what was happening. Her dark hair, so like her mother Isabel's, is tangled from sleep, but her eyes are sharp and alert. She walks into the room with the natural authority of a child who has never doubted her place in the world.\n\nWhen she sees you, she stops. For a moment, the commanding little princess disappears, and she is simply a girl whose father has been gone for four months.\n\n\"Papá.\"\n\nShe does not run. That would be undignified. But she walks to you very quickly.\n\nPrince Fernando, age 6, Prince of Asturias\n\nThe heir comes next, led by his nurse. He is tall for his age—already showing signs of the magnificent physical presence he will grow into—but his eyes are bleary with sleep. He clutches a small wooden horse in one hand, a toy he has had since infancy.\n\nWhen he sees you, his face transforms. He does run, propriety forgotten, and wraps his arms around your leg with surprising strength.\n\n\"Father! Did you fight the Ottomans? Did you win?\"\n\nPrincess Bianca, age 5\n\nBianca comes down the stairs carefully, one hand on the bannister, the other holding her nurse's fingers. Even half-asleep, even in a rumpled nightgown, she is startlingly beautiful—the legendary beauty the dice gave her already showing in her delicate features.\n\nShe hangs back when she sees the gathering, uncertain, her volatile temperament making her wary of unexpected changes. But when her eyes find you, something settles in her. She releases the nurse's hand and crosses to where the others are gathering, positioning herself close to Lucia.\n\n\"Papá came back,\" she says quietly, as if confirming it to herself.\n\nPrincess Teresa, age 4\n\nTeresa bounds into the room like a small thunderstorm, all energy and noise despite the hour. Of all the children, she seems least affected by being woken—her exceptional constitution means she simply thrives, always.\n\n\"PAPÁ!\"\n\nNo restraint. No dignity. She barrels into you at full speed, nearly knocking Bianca aside, and has to be gathered up before she trips over Fernando.\n\nPrincess Juana, age 3\n\nJuana is carried in by her nurse, still more asleep than awake. But even drowsy, there is something about her—that magnetic quality that draws the eye. She blinks at the candlelight, at the gathering of her siblings, and then sees you.\n\nShe reaches out her arms wordlessly, demanding to be held.\n\nPrince Nicolás, age 2\n\nThe youngest comes last, a sturdy toddler with his father's broad build already evident. He is not quite awake, not quite asleep, and seems more interested in the blankets than in the commotion. But when he is set down among his siblings, he toddles over to where the others have gathered around you and pushes his way into the pile with the determination that will one day make him a legendary warrior.\n\nThe fire crackles. The children cluster around you, wrapped in blankets, warm milk being pressed into small hands by attentive servants. Lucia settles into a chair nearby, one hand resting on her belly, watching.\n\nSix children. Soon to be seven. Your legacy. Your future.\n\nThe nursery quiets as the initial excitement fades and the warmth and lateness of the hour begin to take effect.",

The fire burns high. The children arrange themselves around you—Catalina claiming the seat closest, Fernando leaning against your knee, Teresa somehow ending up in your lap despite the lack of obvious space, the younger ones bundled in blankets nearby.\n\nAnd you talk.\n\nFlorence\n\nYou tell them of the city of the Medici—the red-tiled roofs, the great dome of the cathedral rising over everything, the palazzo where the richest banker in Christendom received you. Bianca's eyes widen when you describe the silks and velvets, the paintings on every wall, the gardens filled with statues.\n\n\"Did Lucia-mama's uncle live there?\" Catalina asks. Always precise. Always remembering details.\n\nNo, you explain. That was Ferrara—another city, where her great-uncle Niccolò rode out to meet you personally. Where servants asked after their mother and all of them by name.\n\nLucia smiles quietly at that, her hand still resting on her belly.\n\nVenice\n\nThe children fall silent when you describe the city on the water.\n\n\"The whole city floats?\" Fernando asks, skeptical. \"How do the horses walk?\"\n\nThere are no horses, you explain. Only boats. Boats everywhere, gliding through streets made of water. Palaces rising straight from the lagoon. A church with golden domes that catch the morning light.\n\nTeresa bounces in your lap. \"I want to go! I want to ride in a boat-street!\"\n\nJuana, curled against your side, says nothing—but her dark eyes are fixed on your face with that unnerving intensity she sometimes has.\n\nThe Mountains\n\nYou tell them about the Alps—the great wall of stone and snow that divides Italy from the north. How the passes were blocked by early storms. How you had to turn east to find another way.\n\n\"Were you scared?\" Bianca asks quietly.\n\nYou consider the question honestly before answering.\n\nNicolás, understanding little but responding to the warmth and the gathering, has fallen asleep against Fernando's shoulder. Fernando, to his credit, does not push his little brother away.\n\nPoland\n\nYou describe Kraków—the castle on the hill, the cold stone churches, the young king not much older than Catalina will be in a few years. A boy already wearing a crown, already preparing for war.\n\n\"He's only fifteen?\" Catalina's voice is sharp with interest. \"And he rules two kingdoms?\"\n\nFernando listens intently when you describe the Polish knights, their winged hussars, their fierce pride. But when you mention the coming war against the Ottomans, his face grows thoughtful rather than excited—the scholar's soul in the warrior's body, already evident at six.\n\nThe Journey Home\n\nThe sea voyage. The storms. The Catalan captain who carried you across the Mediterranean. Barcelona. The long ride across Aragon and Castile, riding day and night to reach them.\n\n\"Why did you hurry so much?\" Teresa asks, yawning now despite her best efforts.\n\nThe fire has burned low. The candles have guttered. One by one, the children have succumbed—Nicolás first, then Juana, then Teresa slumping against you, then Bianca nodding off in her chair. Even Fernando's eyes are heavy, though he fights it.\n\nOnly Catalina remains fully awake, watching you with those dark eyes that see too much and feel too little.\n\nLucia catches your gaze across the room. The children need to go back to bed, her look says. And then you and I need to talk.",

She will have opinions about this. I need to write her response - she can speak freely, ask questions, challenge Juan's thinking. But I must NOT write Juan's responses or decisions - only Lucia's side of the conversation, then stop and wait for Juan to respond.\n\nLet me think about what Lucia would say:\n1.

Without him, the conspiracy loses its purpose.\"\n\nShe turns back to face you.\n\n\"But I am Italian, caro mio. I grew up in Ferrara, where my uncle navigated between Milan and Venice and Florence and the Pope, any one of whom might have swallowed us whole.

While you were away serving Christendom. Whether Luna stays or goes, that fact remains. What is the price of conspiracy in Castile?\"\n\nShe lets the question hang in the air, then softens slightly.\n\n\"I am not saying you are wrong. Perhaps retirement is the wisest course. Luna has served you faithfully, and he deserves peace in his final years, not a knife in the dark.

Refusing a royal summons would be declaring rebellion. They're more likely to come and try to talk their way out of it than to openly defy the King.\n\nLet me draft a realistic table:\n\nTHE SUMMONS\n\nContext\n\nYou have summoned three lords to Toledo:\n\nNoble\nLocation\nDistance\nExpected Arrival\nFadrique Enríquez, Admiral of Castile\nValladolid\n~3 days' ride\nNovember 6-7\nPedro de Stúñiga, Count of Plasencia\nPlasencia\n~4-5 days' ride\nNovember 7-8\nRodrigo Manrique, Count of Paredes\nParedes de Nava\n~5-6 days' ride\nNovember 8-9\n\nCritical factors:\n\nFOR compliance:\n\nRefusing a royal summons is treason—a capital offense\n\nThey have not openly rebelled; they can still claim innocence\n\nYour early return has caught them unprepared\n\nNo overt act has been committed—their conspiracy was \"slow strangulation,\" not rebellion\n\nLuna has been sent away—they may believe they have already won\n\nComing and groveling is the smart play; defiance gains them nothing\n\nAGAINST compliance:\n\nThey may fear you know more than you do\n\nManrique's hatred of Luna is personal and fierce—he may act irrationally\n\nThey may try to coordinate their stories before arriving\n\nOne or more may delay, claiming illness or emergency\n\nFlight is possible, though it would be an admission of guilt\n\nThe key question: Do they come promptly, delay, coordinate, or does someone break ranks?\n\nThe Arrival Table\n\nRoll a d100:\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-5\nDefiance. One of the three—likely Manrique, the most hot-headed—refuses the summons outright. He retreats to his castle and begins gathering men. This is open rebellion. The other two must now choose sides. The conspiracy has become civil war.\n6-10\nFlight. One conspirator—probably Stúñiga, who has the most to lose—flees toward Portugal or Aragon, hoping to escape your justice. The others arrive, but the flight is an admission of guilt that changes everything. You must decide whether to pursue.\n11-18\nCoordinated delay. All three send messengers claiming illness, bad roads, or pressing emergencies. They are buying time—to coordinate their stories, to gauge your intentions, to see if Luna's departure means they have already won. You must wait another week, or send a second, sterner summons.\n19-28\nStaggered and wary. They come, but slowly. Enríquez first, nervous and eager to explain himself. Stúñiga days later, composed and lawyerly. Manrique last, sullen and barely polite. Each has clearly consulted with the others; their stories align suspiciously well. They arrive with larger escorts than necessary—not armies, but enough men to make a point.\n29-42\nCalculated compliance. They come within the expected timeframe, but not a day sooner. Each arrives with a prepared explanation, rehearsed grievances, and carefully worded denials. They are clearly coordinating—probably through messengers on the road—but they are also clearly submitting to royal authority. They will grovel, but they will grovel together, presenting a united front.\n43-58\nPrompt obedience. The summons works as intended. Enríquez arrives first, visibly anxious. Stúñiga follows, his face a mask. Manrique comes last, proud but not defiant. They have not had time to fully coordinate; each is uncertain what the others will say. You can speak to them together or separately, as you choose.\n59-72\nEnríquez breaks first. The Admiral arrives a day early, requesting a private audience before the others come. He is frightened—more frightened than a man with a clear conscience should be. He wants to talk. The question is whether he will offer information about the conspiracy in exchange for mercy, or merely try to distance himself from the others.\n73-82\nDivision in the ranks. The conspirators are not as united as they appeared. Enríquez arrives promptly and seems genuinely eager to reconcile. Stúñiga arrives on time, coldly correct. But Manrique delays, sending excuses—and when he finally arrives, his escort is larger than it should be. The conspiracy is fracturing under pressure.\n83-90\nGroveling. Your early return and Luna's preemptive departure have broken their nerve. All three arrive promptly—Enríquez practically racing to Toledo. They fall over themselves to profess loyalty, to explain away any misunderstandings, to assure you that they never intended anything against the crown. The conspiracy has collapsed into a competition to see who can abase himself most convincingly.\n91-95\nEnríquez confesses. The Admiral arrives a day early and requests a private audience. When granted, he throws himself on your mercy and tells you everything—the meetings, the plans, the discussions of what should happen to Luna. He names names. He begs forgiveness. He offers to testify against the others if you will spare him. You now have a witness.\n96-100\nComplete collapse. Before any of them can arrive, a messenger comes from Stúñiga himself—a letter confessing to \"concerns\" about Luna that \"may have been expressed inappropriately,\" begging your forgiveness, offering substantial \"gifts\" to the crown as proof of his loyalty. The Count has decided that confession and bribery are safer than confrontation. The other two, learning of this, arrive in disarray, each trying to outdo the others in protestations of innocence. The conspiracy is not merely broken; it is humiliated.\n\nRoll when ready.",

His physicians have advised against travel. He begs Your Majesty's understanding and will come to Toledo the moment his health permits. Perhaps in a week, perhaps ten days.

Several bridges are reported washed out. He has dispatched men to assess the damage and will travel to Toledo by the safest route as soon as one can be determined. He prostrates himself before Your Majesty's patience.\n\nThe third messenger arrives on November 8th—bearing the Manrique arms.\n\nRodrigo Manrique, Count of Paredes, reports that a dispute among his vassals requires his immediate attention—a matter of bloodshed between two villages that only his personal intervention can resolve. He dare not leave his lands in such turmoil. He will attend Your Majesty as soon as order is restored. His loyalty to the crown is, as ever, absolute.\n\nWhat You Learn\n\nThree excuses. Three different reasons. All arriving within three days of each other.\n\nIsaac de Baeza's assessment, delivered quietly that evening:\n\n\"Fever, roads, and local disputes. Each excuse plausible on its own. Together...\"\n\nHe spreads his hands.\n\n\"They are talking to each other, Your Majesty. Riders have been seen on the roads between Valladolid, Plasencia, and Paredes.

He's focused on accounts, not intelligence per se, but economic disruption is within his domain.\n\n**Isaac de Baeza** - The spymaster. He should know the most. Luna already told Juan that Isaac's network caught whispers. So Isaac definitely knows something. The question is how much and what he adds to Luna's account.\n\n**Don Alonso Pérez de Vivero** - The Castilian Cortes representative. He's a letrado, a royal accountant.

But I should factor in that there's a realistic chance he might have divided loyalties or at least know more than he should.\n\nLet me create a table that covers various possibilities for each person's knowledge and response.\n\nActually, I think I should create ONE table that covers the collective response - what the group as a whole reveals in this meeting. Different roll results will show different combinations of knowledge and candor.\n\nTHE ADVISORS' RESPONSE\n\nContext\n\nYou have summoned three men:\n\nDiego de Daza — Financial administrator. Would notice economic irregularities: delayed taxes, disrupted revenues, unusual money movements. Not an intelligence operative, but economic disruption falls within his domain.\n\nIsaac de Baeza — Spymaster. Luna already mentioned that Isaac's network caught whispers of the conspiracy. He should know the most—the question is how much more than Luna has already told you.\n\nDon Alonso Pérez de Vivero — Castilian representative to the Council of Realms. A letrado and former royal accountant. Connected to the Cortes, where noble grievances are aired. In an interesting position: he represents the very body from which conspirators might draw support.\n\nFactors in Play\n\nFOR candor and useful information:\n\nIsaac's network has been monitoring the situation; he likely knows more than Luna\n\nDiego's financial records might reveal patterns of economic non-cooperation\n\nAll three men have been loyal servants of the crown\n\nYour direct question demands an answer\n\nThe conspiracy targets Luna, not them—they have no personal stake in protecting the plotters\n\nAGAINST candor and useful information:\n\nDon Alonso sits between crown and Cortes; he may have heard things he is reluctant to repeat\n\nIsaac may have withheld information from Luna for his own reasons\n\nDiego focuses on numbers, not politics—he may have missed the significance of what he saw\n\nFear of being seen as informants against powerful nobles\n\nUncertainty about what you already know—no one wants to reveal more than necessary\n\nWILD CARD — Don Alonso Pérez de Vivero:\nHistorically, the Vivero family had complex loyalties during this period. Don Alonso's position as Cortes representative means he hears noble grievances directly. He may be sympathetic to complaints about Luna even if he opposes conspiracy. Or he may know more than he should about the plotters' plans.\n\nThe Response Table\n\nRoll a d100:\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-5\nVivero's silence. Diego reports financial irregularities from Extremadura. Isaac confirms what Luna told you—no more. But Don Alonso is strangely quiet, offering only that he has \"heard grumbling, as one always does.\" His evasion is conspicuous. Either he knows far more than he admits, or he is sympathetic to the conspirators' grievances. You cannot tell which—but his silence is itself information.\n6-12\nLimited knowledge. Each man reports only what falls within his domain. Diego notes delayed tax shipments from Plasencia and Paredes—significant but not conclusive. Isaac confirms Luna's assessment but adds little new. Don Alonso speaks carefully of \"dissatisfaction among certain lords\" without naming names. They are being cautious, telling you what you likely already know, protecting themselves from accusations of tale-bearing.\n13-22\nDiego's ledgers. The financial administrator has noticed more than expected. He produces records showing a pattern: not just delayed taxes, but coordinated delays. Shipments from Stúñiga, Manrique, and Enríquez lands all slowed in the same weeks. Loans that Luna requested from certain merchants were suddenly unavailable. \"Someone gave instructions, Your Majesty. Money does not move—or stop moving—by coincidence.\" Isaac nods but adds nothing. Don Alonso looks uncomfortable.\n23-35\nIsaac's intelligence. The spymaster has been holding back—from Luna, perhaps from everyone. Now, with you asking directly, he speaks. He names not just the three lords you know, but others who have attended meetings: lesser nobles, second sons, men who carry messages. He knows the conspiracy's rough shape, though not its precise plans. \"They have been careful, Your Majesty. But not careful enough.\" Don Alonso listens with evident surprise—he did not know Isaac knew this much.\n36-50\nCorroborating accounts. All three provide useful information that, together, paints a clearer picture. Diego's financial records show the economic strangulation. Isaac's intelligence confirms the membership and approximate timeline. Don Alonso—carefully, reluctantly—admits that complaints about Luna have been voiced openly in Cortes circles. \"Not treason, Your Majesty. But... fertile ground for it.\" The conspiracy is broader than Luna knew, but also more fragile—built on grievance rather than genuine rebellion.\n51-65\nDon Alonso speaks. The Cortes representative surprises you. After Diego and Isaac have reported, he clears his throat and asks to speak privately—then changes his mind. \"No. This should be heard by all.\" He reveals that he was approached, obliquely, by an agent of Stúñiga. Nothing treasonous was said—merely an inquiry about whether Don Alonso thought Luna's influence was \"excessive.\" He refused to engage further, but he has names: the intermediary, the time, the place. He has been waiting to report this, uncertain whether to burden you during your absence.\n66-78\nIsaac's full report. Your spymaster has been conducting his own investigation, parallel to Luna's. He produces a written summary: names, dates, locations of meetings, the general outline of the conspirators' strategy. The \"slow strangulation\" was deliberate and coordinated. The goal—as best Isaac can determine—is to present you with a unified noble front demanding Luna's removal, backed by implicit threat of non-cooperation if you refuse. \"They do not want civil war, Your Majesty. They want surrender. They believe you will choose peace over your constable.\"\n79-88\nThe fourth name. Isaac hesitates, then speaks. \"There is another, Your Majesty. One whose involvement I have not confirmed but strongly suspect.\" He names a fourth lord—someone not on Luna's list, someone whose participation would significantly broaden the conspiracy's reach and resources. He cannot prove it yet. But if true, the conspiracy is more dangerous than anyone realized. Diego's records, when re-examined with this name in mind, show suggestive patterns. Don Alonso goes pale—he knows this lord, has spoken with him recently, and now recalls comments that take on new meaning.\n89-95\nVivero's confession. Don Alonso asks the others to leave. When you are alone, he kneels. \"Your Majesty, I must confess something.\" He was not merely approached—he attended one of the early meetings, before he understood what was being planned. He thought it was merely nobles airing grievances, as nobles do. When he realized it was coordination against Luna, he withdrew and has avoided the conspirators since. But he heard things. Names. Plans. The demand will not merely be Luna's removal—they want his trial, on charges of corruption and tyranny. They have been gathering evidence, real and fabricated. Don Alonso offers everything he knows in exchange for mercy for his moment of foolishness.\n96-100\nThe document. Isaac produces a letter—intercepted two weeks ago, held back until he could verify its authenticity. It is correspondence between Stúñiga and Manrique, discussing \"the matter we have agreed upon\" and referencing \"our friend the Admiral.\" It does not explicitly mention Luna or treason, but it coordinates the timing of their excuses for not answering your summons. They planned this delay together. More importantly, the letter references \"others who share our concerns\"—suggesting the conspiracy extends beyond the three named lords. Isaac has been working to identify these others. He has two more names, one confirmed, one suspected. The conspiracy is not three lords. It is at least five, possibly more.\n\nRoll when ready.",

A loan Don Álvaro requested from merchants there—merchants who have lent to the crown a dozen times before. Suddenly unavailable. They cite 'liquidity concerns.' But I have seen their books through other channels. They are not short of funds.\"\n\nHe looks up.\n\n\"Individually, each delay has an explanation. Together...\"\n\nHe spreads his hands.\n\n\"Money does not stop moving by coincidence, Your Majesty. Someone gave instructions. Someone coordinated this.\"\n\nIsaac de Baeza — The Network\n\nThe spymaster nods slowly.\n\n\"Don Diego sees the shadow. I have seen some of the substance.\"\n\nHis voice is quiet, measured.\n\n\"The Count of Plasencia has hosted gatherings at his hunting lodge near Trujillo. Three times since July. Small affairs—eight to twelve men. The Count of Paredes attended two of them. The Admiral of Castile attended one, though he arrived separately and left early, as if wishing to minimize his visibility.\"\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\"I do not have men inside these meetings. The attendees were carefully chosen—men who would not talk. But I know who entered and who left. I know how long they stayed. And I know that messengers rode between Plasencia, Paredes, and Valladolid in the days that followed.\"\n\nHis dark eyes meet yours.\n\n\"The conspiracy is real, Your Majesty. Don Álvaro was not imagining threats. These three lords have been meeting, coordinating, and preparing for months. Their strategy appears to be patience—weakening Don Álvaro's position gradually, waiting for the right moment to present their demands.\"\n\nHe glances at the letters from the three lords, still sitting on your desk.\n\n\"The coordinated excuses for not answering your summons—that is not coincidence either. They are still coordinating. Still waiting.\"\n\nDon Alonso Pérez de Vivero — The Cortes\n\nThe Castilian representative is the last to speak. He clears his throat, choosing his words with evident care.\n\n\"Your Majesty, I... must speak carefully. My position requires me to hear grievances from all quarters. What I hear in confidence, I cannot always repeat.\"\n\nHe pauses, gathering himself.\n\n\"But I can say this: complaints about Don Álvaro de Luna are not new. They are not secret. In the halls where the Cortes gathers, in the houses where nobles lodge when they come to Toledo, in the taverns where their retainers drink—the constable's name is spoken with... bitterness.\"\n\nHe meets your eyes, then looks away.\n\n\"Not treason, Your Majesty. I have heard no one speak of rebellion, of defying the crown, of taking up arms. But I have heard men say that Castile groans under the upstart's yoke. That the true nobility is ignored. That the King—God bless him—is deceived by a serpent who controls access to the throne.\"\n\nHe swallows.\n\n\"This is... fertile ground, Your Majesty. Fertile ground for what Don Diego and Don Isaac describe. If the Stúñigas and the Manriques and the Admiral have been meeting, they have not lacked for sympathetic ears. Half the great houses of Castile would be glad to see Don Álvaro gone. They would not rebel to achieve it. But if these three lords present a united demand, backed by implicit threat...\"\n\nHe trails off, then finishes quietly.\n\n\"Many would stand aside, Your Majesty. Many would say nothing. And some might join, if they thought the cause was already won.\"\n\nThe three men stand in silence, waiting.\n\nThe picture is clearer now: a coordinated conspiracy of at least three great lords, executing a strategy of economic pressure and political isolation, operating in an environment where noble resentment of Luna is widespread. Not a rebellion—not yet—but a calculated effort to force your hand.\n\nAnd they are still coordinating. Still waiting. Still expecting to present their demands on their own terms.",

The implicit threat that refusing this second, more generous invitation would be outright defiance\n\nLet me think about the factors:\n\n**FOR compliance:**\n- Don Alonso is a neutral figure, not a royal officer demanding obedience\n- The offer to hear grievances \"without punishment, without prejudice\" is generous\n- Luna has already been sent away - they may feel they've won something\n- Refusing a second invitation, especially one framed as reconciliation, looks like rebellion\n- Two weeks gives them time to coordinate their approach\n- The King has made clear he expects their presence - refusing is now open defiance\n- They have not committed any overt act of treason - they can still claim to be loyal subjects with legitimate grievances\n\n**AGAINST compliance:**\n- They may see this as a trap\n- They may see the generous offer as weakness and press their advantage\n- Manrique's hatred is personal and irrational\n- They may feel their position is strong enough to dictate terms\n- They may demand guarantees of safe conduct or other conditions\n- Two weeks gives them time to coordinate - but also to entrench\n\nThe previous roll (14) showed they coordinated their excuses. This time the situation is different:\n- Juan has been more explicit about his expectations\n- Don Alonso is carrying the message personally\n- Luna is gone (sent to Escalona)\n- The King has offered to hear them without punishment\n\nI think the balance has shifted somewhat toward compliance, but there's still risk of defiance or partial compliance.\n\nLet me draft a table that reflects:\n1. The possibility they still refuse (but this should be lower probability now)\n\n2. The possibility they come but united and aggressive in their demands\n3. The possibility they come but divided among themselves\n4. The possibility one of them breaks ranks and acts independently\n5. The possibility they come genuinely seeking reconciliation\n\nTHE SECOND SUMMONS\n\nContext\n\nDon Alonso Pérez de Vivero departs Toledo the following morning. He will visit each of the three lords in turn—a journey of perhaps ten days, allowing time for conversations at each stop. Then they have until the deadline to travel to Toledo.\n\nThe Message:\n\nThe King knows of their concerns\n\nHe wishes to hear them openly, without punishment, without prejudice\n\nA meeting is scheduled two weeks hence\n\nTheir presence is expected—no excuses will be accepted\n\nWhat Has Changed Since the First Summons:\n\nLuna has been sent to Escalona—removed from court\n\nA neutral intermediary carries the invitation, not a royal officer\n\nThe tone is conciliatory, not commanding\n\nBut the deadline is firm and the expectation absolute\n\nRefusal now is not mere delay—it is open defiance of a generous offer\n\nFactors in Play\n\nFOR compliance:\n\nLuna's departure removes the immediate grievance—they may feel they have already won\n\nDon Alonso is a respected neutral figure, not a threat\n\nThe offer to hear grievances \"without punishment\" is remarkably generous\n\nRefusing a second invitation, framed as reconciliation, looks like rebellion\n\nThey have committed no overt treason—they can still present themselves as loyal subjects with legitimate concerns\n\nTwo weeks gives them time to prepare their case properly\n\nThe King's firmness (\"come sickness or high water\") signals this is not a request\n\nAGAINST compliance:\n\nThey may interpret the generous offer as weakness and press harder\n\nManrique's hatred of Luna is personal—Luna's mere survival may not satisfy him\n\nThey may demand conditions: safe conduct guarantees, assurances about Luna's permanent exile\n\nTwo weeks also gives them time to coordinate a more aggressive stance\n\nThey have been building toward this confrontation for months—they may not want to defuse it\n\nSome may fear that \"without punishment\" is a lie—that they will be arrested upon arrival\n\nWILD CARDS:\n\nDon Alonso's conversations may reveal divisions among the three\n\nThe Admiral (Enríquez) was described as \"least committed\"—he may waver\n\nNews of Luna's departure may spread, changing calculations\n\nOther nobles may pressure the three to accept or refuse\n\nThe Arrival Table\n\nRoll a d100:\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-5\nDefiance. They do not come. Instead, a joint letter arrives—signed by all three—declaring that they cannot in good conscience attend while \"certain assurances\" remain unmet. They demand Luna's permanent exile, confiscation of his estates, and a formal trial for his \"crimes against the nobility of Castile.\" This is not negotiation; it is ultimatum. Don Alonso returns shaken, reporting that Manrique spoke of \"other measures\" if the King refuses. The conspiracy has become open rebellion in all but name.\n6-12\nConditions demanded. Two days before the deadline, a messenger arrives. The three lords will attend—but only if the King provides written safe conduct guarantees, pledges that no arrest will be made, and confirms that Luna will not return to court during their visit. They are negotiating the terms of their appearance as if treating with an equal. Don Alonso advises accepting the conditions to avoid escalation; Isaac de Baeza's expression suggests he disagrees.\n13-20\nPartial attendance. The Admiral arrives on time—alone. He claims the others are delayed but coming. Days pass. Stúñiga sends word that illness has genuinely struck his household—plausible, but convenient. Manrique sends nothing at all. You have one of the three, the least committed, while the other two remain at large. The conspiracy is neither broken nor confronted.\n21-32\nUnited but aggressive. All three arrive on the appointed day—together, having coordinated their approach. They come with larger escorts than courtesy permits, their manner correct but cold. When admitted to your presence, they present a formal petition of grievances against Luna: a lengthy document listing alleged crimes, witnessed abuses, and demands for justice. They are not groveling. They are prosecuting. They expect Luna's head, and they have come prepared to argue for it.\n33-45\nWary compliance. All three arrive, but separately, each watching to see what the others do. Enríquez comes first, nervous and eager to explain. Stúñiga arrives the following day, composed and lawyerly. Manrique comes last, on the final day of the deadline, his manner barely civil. They have not fully coordinated their approach—each is uncertain what the others will say. You may speak with them together or separately.\n46-58\nThe Admiral breaks. Enríquez arrives three days early, requesting a private audience before the others come. He is frightened—Don Alonso's visit convinced him that the King knows more than he expected. He wishes to distance himself from the conspiracy, to explain that his grievances were about naval authority, not Luna's blood. He offers information about the others' plans in exchange for understanding. When Stúñiga and Manrique arrive, they find their alliance already fractured.\n59-70\nGrudging submission. All three arrive on time, their manner subdued. Luna's departure and the King's generous offer have taken the wind from their sails. They had prepared for confrontation; they find reconciliation instead. They present their grievances, but without the aggressive edge they had planned—more petition than prosecution. They want assurances that Luna will not return to his former power. They are negotiating, not demanding.\n71-80\nDivision in the ranks. Don Alonso's conversations have exposed fractures. Enríquez wants compromise and has said so openly. Stúñiga is willing to negotiate but insists on guarantees. Manrique alone remains committed to Luna's destruction—and he arrives furious that the others have \"weakened.\" The united front has collapsed. You face three men with three different positions, no longer coordinating, each uncertain whether the others will support him.\n81-88\nGenuine reconciliation. Something has shifted. Perhaps Luna's departure was enough. Perhaps Don Alonso's diplomatic skill found the right words. Perhaps the King's combination of firmness and generosity reminded them who they are dealing with. All three arrive on time, their manner respectful. Their grievances are presented as grievances—concerns from loyal subjects who feel unheard—not demands from conspirators with swords behind their backs. The crisis may actually be defused.\n89-95\nStúñiga's calculation. The Count of Plasencia arrives early, alone, and requests a private audience. He is the architect of the conspiracy—the patient spider—and he has done his calculations. The King knows. Luna is gone. The moment for confrontation has passed. He offers a deal: he will publicly reconcile with the crown, bring Enríquez with him, and isolate Manrique as a lone malcontent. In exchange, he wants something—a position, a favor, a promise. He is switching sides, and he wants to be paid for it.\n96-100\nComplete collapse. Before the deadline arrives, all three send separate messages—each seeking private audience, each eager to explain that their involvement was misunderstood, each offering information about the others. The conspiracy has not merely fractured; it has disintegrated into a competition to see who can abandon ship fastest. When they finally arrive in Toledo, they cannot look at each other. Whatever unity they had is gone, replaced by mutual suspicion and the desperate scramble of men who have realized they chose the losing side.\n\nRoll when ready.",

But...\"\n\nHe hesitates.\n\n\"They have been meeting. At Plasencia, after I delivered your invitation. All three together, along with others I did not recognize. They are not coming to reconcile.

Whatever they have planned, they mean to see it through.\"\n\nThe Arrival — November 22, 1439, Morning\n\nThey come together.\n\nThe gates of Toledo report them first: a column approaching from the west, flying the banners of three great houses. Stúñiga's chains on red. Manrique's golden cauldrons. The anchors of the Admiral of Castile.\n\nThey ride into the city as if entering conquered territory—backs straight, faces hard, escorts arrayed in perfect formation. The people of Toledo line the streets to watch, murmuring. This is not how nobles come to petition their king. This is how nobles come to war.\n\nYour steward counts the escorts: nearly two hundred armed men between the three parties. Far more than courtesy permits. Not enough to threaten the city—but enough to make a statement.\n\nThey dismount in the courtyard of the Alcázar and request audience.\n\nThe Audience Chamber — November 22, 1439, Midday\n\nYou receive them in the great hall, seated on the throne of Castile. Your own guards line the walls—you have ensured that your numbers match theirs. Diego de Daza stands to one side, ledgers ready. Isaac de Baeza is somewhere in the shadows, watching. Don Alonso Pérez de Vivero hovers near the door, his role as intermediary now concluded.\n\nThe three lords enter together.\n\nPedro de Stúñiga, Count of Plasencia, walks in the center—the architect, the spider. He is perhaps fifty, grey-bearded, his face composed into an expression of perfect courtesy that reveals nothing. He wears black velvet trimmed with silver, understated and expensive.\n\nRodrigo Manrique, Count of Paredes, walks to his right. Younger than Stúñiga, harder-edged, with the bearing of a soldier rather than a courtier. His jaw is set, his eyes fixed on you with barely concealed hostility. Whatever grievance drives him, it is personal.\n\nFadrique Enríquez, Admiral of Castile, walks to Stúñiga's left. He is the oldest of the three, his hair white, his bearing dignified. But there is something uncertain in his eyes—a flicker of doubt, perhaps, or regret. He is here because he committed himself, not because he is certain.\n\nThey stop at the appropriate distance and bow—correctly, but no deeper than protocol requires.\n\nStúñiga speaks.\n\n\"Your Majesty. We thank you for receiving us. We come as loyal subjects of the Crown, bearing grievances that we believe Your Majesty will wish to hear.\"\n\nHe produces a rolled document from his sleeve—thick, sealed with three wax impressions.\n\n\"We present to Your Majesty a formal petition of the nobility of Castile, concerning the conduct of Don Álvaro de Luna, Constable of Castile, and his abuse of the trust Your Majesty has placed in him.\"\n\nHe steps forward and offers the document.\n\n\"The charges are documented. The witnesses are named. We ask only for justice, Your Majesty—justice that has been too long delayed.\"\n\nManrique's voice cuts in, harsher than Stúñiga's measured tones.\n\n\"The constable has enriched himself at the kingdom's expense. He has denied loyal nobles access to their king. He has appointed his creatures to offices that should go to men of ancient blood. He has made himself a tyrant in all but name.\"\n\nHis eyes burn.\n\n\"We do not ask for his exile, Your Majesty. We ask for his trial. Let him answer for his crimes before the Cortes, before God, before the kingdom he has plundered.\"\n\nThe Admiral says nothing.

He's giving them rope to either hang themselves or reveal their full hand.\n\nI need to have the three lords respond. Based on the roll (21 - United but aggressive), they came prepared with demands, they're not groveling, they're prosecuting. They expect Luna's head and they've come prepared to argue for it.\n\nThe question is: do they have other demands beyond Luna's trial? Given the \"united but aggressive\" result, they probably do - or at least they want guarantees. But they've also been careful to frame this as loyal subjects seeking justice, not rebels making demands.\n\nLet me have them respond in character:\n- Stúñiga is the spider, the careful one - he'll probably try to frame any additional demands carefully\n- Manrique is the hot-head who hates Luna personally - he might reveal more than Stúñiga wants\n- Enríquez is the uncertain one - he's staying quiet\n\nI should stop after they respond and wait for Juan's reaction.

Not exile. Not quiet retirement. A trial, with evidence presented, witnesses heard, and judgment rendered according to law.\"\n\nA second finger.\n\n\"Second: that the offices Don Álvaro has accumulated—Constable, Grand Master of Santiago, and the dozen lesser positions he has gathered—be distributed among the great houses of Castile as tradition demands. No one man should hold such power. No one man should stand between the nobility and their king.\"\n\nA third finger.\n\n\"Third: that Your Majesty establish a council of the realm—nobles of ancient blood who will advise the crown and ensure that no future favorite can rise to such dangerous heights. We do not seek to diminish royal authority. We seek to protect it from those who would abuse Your Majesty's trust.\"\n\nManrique steps forward, unable to contain himself.\n\n\"And we ask that this be done now, Your Majesty. Not delayed. Not deferred. Not handed to committees that will deliberate for years while Luna plots his return from whatever comfortable exile he currently enjoys.\"\n\nHis voice rises.\n\n\"We know he has been sent to Escalona. We know he sits there with his fortune intact, his allies still in place, waiting for this storm to pass. It will not pass. We will not allow—\"\n\n\"Rodrigo.\"\n\nStúñiga's voice is quiet but sharp. Manrique stops, his jaw working, his hands clenched at his sides.\n\nThe Count of Plasencia turns back to you, his composure restored.\n\n\"Forgive my colleague's passion, Your Majesty. The Count of Paredes has suffered more than most from the constable's... excesses. His feeling is understandable, if perhaps too freely expressed.\"\n\nHe extends the document once more.\n\n\"These are our requests.

The petition bears other signatures, as Your Majesty will see.\"\n\nHis eyes meet yours.\n\n\"We ask only for justice, Your Majesty.

Be detailed enough to feel authentic but not so long as to be tedious\n5. Include both legitimate grievances and possibly exaggerated or fabricated claims\n\nLet me draft this document.\n\nTHE PETITION\n\nYou take the document from Stúñiga's hand. The seal breaks easily—three impressions in red wax, the arms of each house.\n\nThe parchment is heavy, expensive. The hand is that of a professional scribe, neat and legible. This was not dashed off in anger; it was prepared carefully, over time.\n\nPetitio Nobilitatis Castellae contra Dominum Alvarum de Luna\n\nPetition of the Nobility of Castile against Don Álvaro de Luna\n\nPreamble\n\nTo His Most Excellent Majesty Juan II, by the Grace of God King of Castile, León, Aragon, Naples, and Sicily, Defender of the Faith and Protector of Christendom:\n\nWe, the undersigned lords and nobles of the realm of Castile, loyal subjects of Your Majesty and faithful servants of the Crown, do humbly present this petition concerning the conduct of Don Álvaro de Luna, Constable of Castile, Master of the Order of Santiago, and holder of sundry other offices and dignities.\n\nWe do not bring these charges lightly. We have suffered in silence for many years, trusting that Your Majesty would in time perceive the truth. But the constable's abuses have grown beyond endurance, and conscience compels us to speak.\n\nArticle I: Unlawful Accumulation of Offices\n\nDon Álvaro de Luna holds simultaneously the offices of Constable of Castile, Grand Master of the Order of Santiago, and numerous lesser positions including but not limited to: Alcaide of seven royal fortresses, Lord of ninety-three towns and villages, and recipient of revenues from crown lands exceeding 100,000 florins annually.\n\nSuch accumulation is without precedent and contrary to the ancient customs of the realm. No subject should wield such power. The effect has been to make Don Álvaro a prince in all but name, subordinate to none but Your Majesty and answerable to no one.\n\nArticle II: Obstruction of Access to the Crown\n\nDon Álvaro has systematically prevented the nobility of Castile from approaching Your Majesty directly. Petitions are intercepted. Audiences are denied or delayed. Those who seek royal favor must first obtain the constable's approval, transforming what should be free access to our sovereign into a toll road controlled by one man.\n\nSpecific instances are documented in the attached testimony, including the experience of Don Rodrigo Manrique, Count of Paredes, who was denied audience for seventeen months despite repeated requests concerning a legitimate inheritance dispute.\n\nArticle III: Corruption and Self-Enrichment\n\nDon Álvaro has exploited his position to enrich himself and his family at the kingdom's expense. Lands that should have escheated to the crown have been diverted to his allies. Offices that should have been awarded on merit have been sold to the highest bidder or granted to his creatures. Tax revenues have been collected in the crown's name and diverted to his personal treasury.\n\nWe estimate that Don Álvaro's fortune now exceeds 500,000 florins—a sum that could only have been accumulated through systematic plunder of royal resources.\n\nArticle IV: Persecution of Noble Houses\n\nDon Álvaro has used his power to punish those who oppose him and reward those who submit. Noble families who refused to acknowledge his supremacy have found their petitions denied, their lawsuits ruled against, their sons excluded from royal service. Meanwhile, families of lesser blood who attached themselves to the constable have risen beyond their station.\n\nThe natural order of the realm has been inverted. Ancient houses are humiliated while upstarts flourish.\n\nArticle V: Usurpation of Royal Authority\n\nDuring Your Majesty's absences—which the constable has encouraged, the better to rule unchecked—Don Álvaro has issued decrees in the crown's name without proper authorization. He has made war and peace, appointed and dismissed officials, and conducted foreign policy as if he were himself the sovereign.\n\nWe do not question Your Majesty's right to delegate authority. But delegation requires trust, and that trust has been abused. Don Álvaro has not served the crown; he has worn it.\n\nArticle VI: Endangerment of the Succession\n\nDon Álvaro's influence extends even to the royal nursery. He has placed his creatures among the servants who attend the royal children. He has ensured that Prince Fernando, heir to the throne, grows up surrounded by men loyal to the constable rather than to the house of Trastámara.\n\nWe do not suggest that Don Álvaro intends harm to the royal family. But a prudent king does not allow one subject to control access to his heirs. The potential for abuse is too great.\n\nPrayer for Relief\n\nWherefore, we humbly petition Your Majesty:\n\nFIRST, that Don Álvaro de Luna be brought before the Cortes of Castile to answer these charges, with evidence presented and witnesses heard according to law;\n\nSECOND, that upon conviction, his offices be stripped and distributed among the great houses of the realm as ancient custom requires;\n\nTHIRD, that his illegally accumulated wealth be confiscated and returned to the royal treasury;\n\nFOURTH, that a permanent council of noble advisors be established to prevent any future subject from attaining such dangerous eminence;\n\nFIFTH, that all those who suffered under the constable's persecution be restored to royal favor and compensated for their losses.\n\nWe ask nothing for ourselves but justice. We seek nothing but the good of the realm and the protection of Your Majesty's sacred authority from those who would abuse it.\n\nSignatories\n\nPedro de Stúñiga, Count of Plasencia\n\nRodrigo Manrique, Count of Paredes\n\nFadrique Enríquez, Admiral of Castile\n\nGarcía Álvarez de Toledo, Count of Alba\n\nPedro Álvarez Osorio, Marquis of Astorga\n\nRodrigo Alonso Pimentel, Count of Benavente\n\nFernando Álvarez de Toledo, Lord of Valdecorneja\n\nYou count the signatures.

      "text": "In medieval Castile, there were different ways a trial could be conducted:\n1. The King himself could judge\n2. The Cortes could sit in judgment\n3. A panel of nobles could judge\n4. Some combination\n\nThe nobles are asking for a trial before the Cortes - but who actually renders judgment? This is a crucial question because:\n- If the nobles judge, they will certainly condemn Luna\n- If the King judges, he retains control\n- If the Cortes as a body judges, it depends on composition\n\nStúñiga is the clever one here. He needs to answer this carefully. He probably wants noble judgment (which would condemn Luna), but he can't say that too openly without appearing to usurp royal authority.\n\nLet me have Stúñiga respond carefully, trying to frame it in a way that sounds reasonable but actually gives the nobles control over the verdict.\n\nI should NOT generate any dialogue or action for Juan - just have the NPCs respond to his question and then stop.\n\nStúñiga does not answer immediately. The question has touched something—you see Manrique's eyes narrow, the Admiral shift his weight. This is terrain they have discussed, perhaps argued over.\n\nWhen Stúñiga speaks, his words are carefully chosen.\n\n\"Your Majesty raises the heart of the matter.\"\n\nHe folds his hands before him, the posture of a man presenting a reasoned argument.\n\n\"In ancient times, when a great lord was accused of crimes against the realm, he was judged by his peers—the other great lords of the kingdom, assembled in council. This was the custom of our forefathers. A nobleman could not be condemned by lesser men, only by those of equal rank who understood the burdens and temptations of power.\"\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\"We propose that Don Álvaro be tried before the Cortes, with judgment rendered by a council of the senior nobility—the grandees of Castile, the masters of the Military Orders, the great officers of the realm. Men of sufficient stature to weigh evidence fairly and render verdict without fear or favor.\"\n\nManrique cuts in, his voice hard.\n\n\"Not the King. The King has been deceived by Luna for thirty years. The King cannot judge fairly when his own judgment is what Luna has corrupted.\"\n\nStúñiga's expression tightens at this interruption, but he does not contradict it.\n\n\"The Count of Paredes speaks... directly,\" he says. \"But his concern is not without merit. Your Majesty's long association with the constable might be seen—by some—as compromising the appearance of impartial justice. We do not question Your Majesty's wisdom or integrity. But justice must not only be done; it must be seen to be done.\"\n\nHe spreads his hands.\n\n\"A verdict rendered by the assembled nobility, in open session of the Cortes, with evidence presented and witnesses heard—such a verdict could not be questioned. It would carry the authority of the entire realm, not merely the will of one man.\"\n\nThe Admiral finally speaks, his voice quiet and tired.\n\n\"We are not asking Your Majesty to surrender royal authority. The King remains supreme. But in this one matter—where the accused has been the King's closest companion for three decades—perhaps it is wise to let others bear the burden of judgment.\"\n\nHe meets your eyes for the first time.\n\n\"For the King's own protection, Your Majesty. So that no one can say the verdict was tainted by friendship or resentment. So that justice is seen to be clean.\"\n\nStúñiga nods.\n\n\"The King would preside, of course. The King would confirm or reject the verdict. But the weighing of evidence, the questioning of witnesses, the deliberation—these would fall to a council of peers.\"\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\"This is our proposal, Your Majesty. We believe it to be just, lawful, and in keeping with the ancient customs of the realm.\"\n\nThe three men wait.",

Whether they actually have solid evidence or are bluffing\n2. The nature of their \"evidence\" - is it real corruption or manufactured grievances?\n3. How they react to Juan handing back the scroll - do they take this as rejection or as a question?\n\nGiven the situation:\n- Luna has been in power for decades and has certainly made enemies\n- Some of the accusations might have merit (accumulation of offices is real)\n- Some might be exaggerated or fabricated\n- They've been preparing this for months\n\nI should have them respond but not generate Juan's reaction. Stúñiga would likely answer this carefully, perhaps with some confidence about their evidence. Manrique might be more aggressive. The Admiral remains quiet.\n\nThe handing back of the scroll is significant - it could be read as rejection, or as \"I've read it, now convince me.\" The nobles would be uncertain.\n\nStúñiga takes the scroll back, his expression betraying nothing. But you see his fingers tighten slightly on the parchment. He did not expect you to return it unread—or rather, read and handed back without comment on its contents.\n\n\"Evidence, Your Majesty?\"\n\nHe tucks the scroll back into his sleeve, his composure recovered.\n\n\"We have spent considerable effort gathering testimony and documentation, yes. We did not bring charges lightly, nor will we prosecute them carelessly.\"\n\nHe gestures to Manrique, who produces a leather satchel that has been waiting at his side.\n\n\"Seventeen depositions from nobles who were denied access to Your Majesty during the constable's tenure. Twelve sworn statements from merchants who paid bribes to Luna's agents for contracts that should have been awarded openly. Accounts from treasury clerks—obtained at some risk—showing discrepancies between recorded revenues and actual receipts.\"\n\nManrique opens the satchel, revealing bundled documents.\n\n\"Letters in Luna's own hand directing appointments to men of no qualification beyond their loyalty to him. Records of land transfers that enriched his family at the crown's expense. Testimony from servants who witnessed...\"\n\nHe stops, glancing at Stúñiga.\n\nStúñiga continues smoothly.\n\n\"We have evidence, Your Majesty. Perhaps not enough to convince a court that wished to acquit—but more than enough to persuade honest men that something is deeply wrong. And we believe that once the trial begins, others will come forward. Men who have been afraid to speak while Luna held power. Men who will find their courage when they see he can be brought to account.\"\n\nThe Admiral clears his throat.\n\n\"Your Majesty should understand... we do not claim that every charge can be proven beyond dispute. Don Álvaro is clever. He has covered his tracks where he could. But the pattern is clear. The accumulation of offices—that is documented fact. The obstruction of access—dozens will testify. The enrichment...\"\n\nHe shrugs.\n\n\"Your Majesty knows what Luna was when he entered royal service, and what he is now. The mathematics speak for themselves.\"\n\nStúñiga's eyes are fixed on you.\n\n\"We are prepared to prosecute this case before the Cortes, Your Majesty. We ask only for the opportunity.\"",

They came prepared for confrontation—for demands and counter-demands, for negotiation, perhaps for threats. They did not prepare for the King to sit down and read their evidence like a magistrate reviewing a case.\n\nStúñiga recovers first. He nods to Manrique, who steps forward and places the leather satchel on the table. Then he gestures to the door, and servants from their own retinue enter bearing two wooden chests—document cases, heavy with paper and parchment.\n\nDiego de Daza dispatches a page for scribes. Within minutes, three clerks arrive with ink, quills, and blank ledgers, taking positions at a side table.\n\nThe evidence is laid out before you.\n\nThe Documents\n\nBundle One: Denied Audiences\n\nSeventeen sworn depositions, each bearing a noble seal. The Count of Paredes's complaint is on top—seventeen months denied access to the King regarding an inheritance dispute with a neighboring lord. Others follow: a baron from Galicia who traveled to Toledo three times and was turned away each time; a widow seeking confirmation of her son's rights; lesser nobles with legitimate grievances who never reached royal ears.\n\nEach deposition follows the same pattern: the petitioner approached the court, was told the King was unavailable, was directed to Don Álvaro's staff, and either received no response or was told their matter was \"not a priority.\"\n\nBundle Two: Commercial Corruption\n\nTwelve statements from merchants—wool traders, shipowners, suppliers to the royal household. Each describes payments made to intermediaries identified as \"the constable's men\" in exchange for contracts, licenses, or favorable rulings. The amounts vary: fifty florins here, two hundred there, one payment of eight hundred florins for a salt monopoly in Murcia.\n\nThe merchants' seals are genuine. Several of the names you recognize as established traders who have done business with the crown for decades.\n\nBundle Three: Treasury Discrepancies\n\nThese are more technical—columns of figures, cross-references, marginal notes in cramped clerical hands. Diego de Daza moves closer, his professional interest awakened. The documents purport to show differences between tax revenues recorded in local accounts and amounts that reached Toledo. The gaps are small in any single instance—a few hundred florins here and there—but they accumulate.\n\nA note attached to this bundle, unsigned, claims the records were provided by \"a servant of the treasury who fears for his soul.\"\n\nBundle Four: Appointments\n\nLetters bearing Luna's seal—or what appear to be his seal—directing appointments to various offices. A customs inspector in Seville. A judge in Burgos. An alcaide for a minor fortress in La Mancha. Each letter recommends a candidate in terms that suggest the recommendation is actually a command.\n\nAccompanying each letter is a deposition from someone claiming the appointed man was unqualified, or that more suitable candidates were passed over, or that the appointment was widely understood to be payment for loyalty to Luna rather than service to the crown.\n\nBundle Five: Land Transfers\n\nRecords from local registries showing properties that passed into the hands of Luna's family or known associates. Some appear legitimate—purchases at fair prices, inheritances properly recorded. Others are more questionable: lands acquired from widows in financial distress, properties transferred just before legal judgments that would have awarded them elsewhere, estates that somehow escaped escheatment to the crown.\n\nBundle Six: The Testimony of Servants\n\nThis bundle is thinner than the others, and Manrique hesitates slightly before placing it on the table. Four depositions from men who claim to have served in Luna's household or in positions where they observed his private conduct. The allegations are more sensational than the financial evidence: secret meetings with unnamed foreigners, letters burned after reading, conversations overheard in which Luna allegedly spoke of the King with contempt.\n\nThe seals on these depositions are unfamiliar. The testimony is vivid but vague on verifiable details.\n\nThe Atmosphere\n\nThe afternoon light slants through the high windows. The scribes' quills scratch as they begin cataloguing what lies before you. Diego de Daza has already pulled the treasury documents toward him, his lips moving silently as he checks figures.\n\nThe three lords remain standing. They have not been invited to sit, and they dare not presume. Stúñiga's face is a mask of patient courtesy. Manrique shifts from foot to foot, barely containing his impatience. The Admiral stares at the far wall, looking like a man who wishes he were anywhere else.\n\nGuards line the walls, motionless. Isaac de Baeza has materialized from somewhere and stands in a shadowed corner, watching everything.\n\nThe evidence lies before you—hours of reading, if you choose to examine it all.",

The Admiral simply nods, something like relief flickering across his tired face.\n\nThe Courtyard Garden — November 22, 1439, Late Afternoon\n\nYou lead them through the side passage into the small courtyard garden that adjoins the royal apartments. It is not a large space—an orange tree, dormant now in November; a stone fountain, dry for the season; benches along the walls. But it is private. The noise of the Alcázar fades behind you.\n\nThe late autumn sun hangs low, casting long shadows across the flagstones.

      "text": "What Juan has done in this encounter:\n1. Received them formally but did not react defensively to their petition\n2. Asked probing questions rather than rejecting their demands outright\n3. Took their scroll, read it, then handed it back - a somewhat ambiguous gesture\n4. Asked about the evidence they have\n5. When they presented evidence, he sat down to examine it like a magistrate\n6. Called for scribes and Diego to catalog the evidence - treating it seriously\n7. Now he's walked them outside privately, away from the formal setting\n8. He's expressed that he feels \"terribly betrayed\" - siding with their narrative\n9. He's agreed to summon the Cortes immediately\n10. He's said he needs time to examine the documents\n\nWhat is Juan actually doing here? He seems to be:\n- Playing along with their accusations against Luna\n- Acting as if he believes their evidence\n- Agreeing to their primary demand (a trial before the Cortes)\n- Building rapport by seeming to be on their side\n\nBut what is he actually persuading them OF? He hasn't made a counter-demand. He hasn't asked them for anything. He seems to be agreeing with them.\n\nWait - I think the persuasion here is about whether the lords BELIEVE Juan is genuinely on their side, or whether they suspect a trap. Juan is essentially trying to defuse the confrontation by appearing to give them what they want.\n\nThe question for the roll is: Do the lords believe Juan's performance? Do they think they've won? Or do they remain suspicious?\n\nLet me draft the factors:\n\nSUCCESS FACTORS:\n- Juan did not defend Luna or dismiss their charges\n- He examined their evidence seriously, like a fair judge\n- He called scribes to catalog it - treating it as legitimate\n- He expressed feeling \"betrayed\" - aligning himself with their grievance\n- He agreed to summon the Cortes - their primary demand\n\n- The private garden conversation creates a sense of shared confidence\n- Sending Luna away demonstrates he's willing to act against his longtime ally\n- The intimate setting removes the formality that might suggest performance\n\nFAILURE FACTORS:\n- Juan is known to be clever - they may suspect a trap\n- He handed back their scroll without commenting on specifics - ambiguous\n- Luna has served Juan for 30 years - can he really turn on him this easily?\n- His willingness to grant everything they asked for might seem too convenient\n\n, designed to lower their guard\n- The broader conspiracy involving seven houses remains unaddressed\n- No concrete guarantees about how the trial will actually proceed\n\nThe outcomes depend heavily on how they interpret his intentions. If they're skeptical, they'll see manipulation and demand tangible proof before backing down. If they're partially convinced, the group might splinter as each lord weighs the risks differently. Complete belief could shift them toward cooperation, even gratitude. At the extreme, genuine conviction might cause them to overextend and reveal details about their other conspirators or true objectives.\n\nPERSUASION: The Garden Conversation\n\nEvaluation of Factors\n\nWhat Juan Has Done:\n\nReceived the lords formally without defensive reaction\n\nAsked probing questions rather than rejecting demands outright\n\nRead their petition seriously, then returned it without dismissal\n\nAsked about their evidence—treating their case as legitimate\n\nSat down to examine documents like a magistrate, not a defendant\n\nCalled for scribes to catalog the evidence—institutional acceptance\n\nWalked them outside privately—intimacy, not confrontation\n\nExpressed feeling \"terribly betrayed\"—aligning with their grievance\n\nAgreed to summon the Cortes immediately—their primary demand\n\nAsked for time to examine documents—reasonable, not evasive\n\nSuccess Factors:\n\nLuna has already been sent to Escalona—proof Juan is not blindly loyal\n\nJuan did not defend Luna or dismiss their charges\n\nThe private garden setting humanizes the encounter, removes courtly posturing\n\nJuan's expressed \"betrayal\" aligns him with the aggrieved party, not the accused\n\nAgreeing to summon the Cortes gives them exactly what they demanded\n\nJuan has not threatened, intimidated, or invoked royal authority against them\n\nThe scribes cataloging evidence signals institutional legitimacy, not a trap\n\nDon Alonso's earlier mission already signaled willingness to reconcile\n\nJuan's calm, judicial demeanor throughout—no anger, no accusation\n\nFailure Factors:\n\nJuan is known to be shrewd—Stúñiga especially will suspect a trap\n\nThirty years of friendship with Luna cannot be discarded so easily—can it?\n\nJuan handed back the scroll without commenting on specific charges—ambiguous\n\nThe private walk isolates them from their retinues and witnesses\n\nManrique's hatred is personal and implacable—he wants Luna's blood, not process\n\nThey came prepared for confrontation; sudden agreement may seem suspicious\n\nSeven houses signed the petition—Juan has not addressed the broader coalition\n\nNo specific commitment about trial outcome or Luna's fate\n\nThe Admiral's silence suggests doubt already—he may infect the others\n\nStúñiga is a patient spider; he does not trust sudden victories\n\nThe Persuasion Table\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-5\nSuspicion hardens into certainty. Stúñiga's eyes narrow. This is too easy. The King who defended Luna for thirty years suddenly believes their evidence after one afternoon? He exchanges a glance with Manrique. They smell a trap—delay, division, time for Luna to escape or counterattack. They demand immediate guarantees: Luna's arrest, not mere exile; a date certain for the trial; noble judges named now, not later. The confrontation is not defused; it escalates.\n6-12\nManrique refuses to relent. The Count of Paredes spits on the flagstones. \"Words, Your Majesty. We have heard words before.\" He demands Luna's arrest tonight, his assets frozen, his family detained as surety. Stúñiga tries to moderate, but Manrique's fury has been building for months. He will not be calmed by a walk in a garden. The Admiral looks stricken. The united front holds, but barely, and only because Manrique is pulling it toward confrontation.\n13-22\nCautious skepticism. Stúñiga bows politely and thanks Your Majesty for hearing their concerns. But his voice carries no warmth. They will wait for the Cortes, he says. They will observe whether justice is truly done. They remain united, watchful, ready to escalate if the trial is delayed or the verdict unsatisfactory. You have bought time, but not trust. They depart together, their alliance intact, their suspicion undiminished.\n23-35\nGrudging acceptance. The lords are uncertain what to make of your response. They expected resistance; they received agreement. Stúñiga probes carefully, asking when the Cortes will be summoned, who will preside, what procedures will govern the trial. He is testing for traps. The Admiral seems relieved; Manrique seems frustrated. They accept your proposal but depart with reservations—watching, waiting, not yet convinced that victory is assured.\n36-50\nThe Admiral wavers. Enríquez speaks for the first time since entering the garden. \"Your Majesty's willingness to hear us... it is more than we hoped.\" His voice is tired, grateful. Stúñiga shoots him a sharp look—too much, too soon—but the Admiral continues. He thanks you for your fairness. He expresses hope that justice can be done without further division. Manrique scowls, but the united front has cracked. The Admiral wants this to be over; the others want victory.\n51-65\nBelief takes hold. Your performance has worked—at least partially. Stúñiga's mask slips slightly; you see something like satisfaction beneath. He believes the King has turned against Luna. The Cortes will be summoned; the trial will proceed; justice will be done. He bows more deeply than before. The Admiral exhales visibly. Only Manrique remains tense, but even he seems to accept that the path forward is political now, not confrontational. They depart as men who believe they have won.\n66-78\nStúñiga's calculation shifts. The Count of Plasencia reassesses. He came prepared for a siege; he finds an open gate. A wise man does not question fortune—he exploits it. Stúñiga begins speaking of cooperation, of how the trial can be conducted fairly and efficiently, of his desire to support the crown through this difficult time. He is positioning himself for what comes after—ally to the King who brought Luna to justice, not rebel who forced the King's hand. The conspiracy transforms into partnership.\n79-88\nDivisions emerge. Your approach has fractured their unity. The Admiral openly expresses gratitude and relief. Stúñiga is calculating advantage. But Manrique grows visibly angry at his allies' softening. \"This changes nothing,\" he insists. \"Luna must die, not merely be tried.\" The others look uncomfortable. You see the fault lines: the Admiral wants peace, Stúñiga wants power, Manrique wants blood. They depart together, but they are no longer speaking with one voice.\n89-95\nThe Admiral confesses. Enríquez asks to speak with you privately—just for a moment, he begs, while the others wait. When granted, his words tumble out: he never wanted it to go this far. He joined because he felt he had no choice, because Stúñiga assured him it was the only way, because his grievances about the Admiralty were real even if his methods were wrong. He offers to support whatever resolution you devise. He will testify about the conspiracy's formation if needed. The united front is not merely cracked; one pillar has defected.\n96-100\nComplete success. Your calm, judicial demeanor—your willingness to examine evidence, to summon the Cortes, to express your own sense of betrayal—has transformed the encounter entirely. They came as accusers; they leave as petitioners grateful for a fair hearing. Stúñiga speaks of his \"relief\" that the King understands. The Admiral practically weeps with gratitude. Even Manrique, though still grim, acknowledges that Your Majesty has acted \"honorably.\" More importantly: in the relaxed atmosphere, one of them lets slip something useful—another name, a detail about their preparations, a hint about what they truly fear. You have not merely defused the crisis; you have gained intelligence.\n\nRoll when ready.",

His eyes search your face—looking for the trap, the hidden blade, the catch that must surely accompany such easy agreement. He finds nothing. Your expression is that of a man genuinely shaken, genuinely processing betrayal.\n\nAnd yet.\n\n\"Your Majesty is... gracious,\" he says carefully. \"We are gratified that our concerns will be heard.\"\n\nBut his voice carries no warmth. This is a man who has spent months preparing for battle and finds his enemy offering surrender. It is too clean. Too simple.\n\nHe probes, delicately.\n\n\"When does Your Majesty intend to summon the Cortes? The evidence we have presented requires careful examination, of course, but justice delayed...\"\n\nHe leaves the proverb unfinished.\n\nManrique is less subtle. His arms are crossed, his jaw set.\n\n\"And what of Luna in the meantime? He sits in Escalona with his fortune, his men, his allies still in place throughout the kingdom. Every day he remains free is a day he plots his return.\"\n\nHis eyes bore into yours.\n\n\"We have heard promises before, Your Majesty. Forgive us if we require more than words.\"\n\nThe Admiral says nothing, but his posture has shifted. Where before he seemed burdened, now there is a flicker of something else—hope, perhaps, or relief. He glances at his companions as if willing them to accept what is being offered.\n\nStúñiga ignores him. His attention remains fixed on you.\n\n\"Your Majesty speaks of examining documents, of requiring time. This is reasonable. But we must ask: what assurances can Your Majesty offer that this examination will lead to trial, and that the trial will lead to justice? We have brought evidence of serious crimes. If that evidence is... set aside, or explained away, or lost in the machinery of royal administration...\"\n\nHe spreads his hands.\n\n\"We would be forced to conclude that Your Majesty's words today were merely words. And we would be forced to consider other remedies.\"\n\nIt is not quite a threat.

      "text": "Historically, Álvaro de Luna was indeed eventually executed in 1453 on charges that were largely politically motivated - he had accumulated enormous power and wealth, but the \"treason\" charges were more about noble resentment than actual betrayal of the crown. The historical Luna was loyal to Juan II but had made many enemies through his dominance of the court.\n\nIn our alternate timeline, Luna has been a loyal and effective servant of Juan for decades. The question is:\n1. Has Luna actually committed the abuses the nobles claim?\n2. Or are these charges fabricated/exaggerated by nobles who simply resent his power?\n3. Or is the truth somewhere in between - Luna accumulated power and wealth (which is normal for someone in his position) but the nobles are framing normal court politics as treason?\n\nThis is a crucial determination that should have been rolled for earlier. The user is right to call this out.\n\nLet me think about what factors would be relevant:\n\nFOR Luna's guilt (or partial guilt):\n- Luna has held enormous power for 30 years - corruption is almost inevitable over such a period\n- He has accumulated offices, lands, and wealth - this is documented fact in our timeline\n- Medieval administration was inherently prone to favoritism and self-dealing\n- The nobles' financial evidence (treasury discrepancies, etc.) would be hard to completely fabricate\n- Some access control to the King is normal for a chief minister - but it can shade into obstruction\n\nFOR Luna's innocence (or charges being exaggerated):\n- Luna has been portrayed throughout the campaign as loyal and competent\n- Juan has trusted him completely and Luna has delivered results\n- The nobles have personal grudges - especially Manrique\n- The \"evidence\" could be fabricated, exaggerated, or taken out of context\n- Normal administrative actions can be reframed as corruption by enemies\n\n- The servant testimony particularly lacks substance and reads more like sensational accusation than credible proof\n\nI need to establish the actual truth through a roll rather than letting the drama carry me forward. A d100 table would help determine how much of the nobles' case holds water versus how much is political maneuvering, and whether Luna has genuinely betrayed Juan's trust or if this is primarily a power play by resentful rivals.\n\nYou raise an absolutely valid point. I have been narrating the conspiracy and their evidence without ever determining through dice whether Luna has actually committed these acts, or whether this is an elaborate political attack using fabricated or exaggerated evidence.\n\nThis is a crucial question that should be resolved before you can meaningfully respond to their demands.\n\nThe Core Question\n\nWhat is the truth about Álvaro de Luna?\n\nHistorically, Luna was eventually executed in 1453 on charges that were largely politically motivated—he had accumulated enormous power and wealth, made many enemies, but was genuinely loyal to Juan II. The \"treason\" was more about noble resentment than actual betrayal.\n\nIn our alternate timeline, Luna has been portrayed as loyal and effective throughout the campaign. But thirty years of near-absolute power could corrupt anyone. The question is: has it?\n\nWhat We Know For Certain\n\nLuna has accumulated significant offices, lands, and wealth (this is fact, not accusation)\n\nLuna has controlled access to Juan during his absences (this is his job, but could shade into abuse)\n\nThe nobles genuinely resent Luna's dominance (their hatred is real, regardless of whether it's justified)\n\nSome of the evidence (treasury discrepancies, appointment letters) would be difficult to fabricate entirely\n\nSome of the evidence (servant testimony) seemed weak and sensational\n\nWhat Should Be Rolled\n\nI propose a d100 table to determine the actual truth about Luna's conduct—not what the nobles claim, but what really happened. This will establish:\n\nHow much of their evidence is legitimate vs. fabricated\n\nWhether Luna has betrayed Juan's trust in any meaningful way\n\nWhether Juan should have noticed warning signs earlier\n\nShall I draft this table? It would range from \"Luna is guilty of everything and more\" to \"This is entirely a political hit job with fabricated evidence\" with various gradations in between.",

The fact that Luna has been portrayed as loyal throughout the campaign\n4. The reality that accumulating power and wealth isn't necessarily treason\n5. The difference between \"abusing position for personal gain\" and \"betraying the king\"\n6. The political motivations of the nobles who have their own axes to grind\n\nThe table should range from:\n- Low rolls: Luna has committed real abuses that Juan didn't notice (but these should be limited by Juan's intelligence)\n- Middle rolls: Luna has done some questionable things but nothing treasonous - the evidence is a mix of truth and exaggeration\n- High rolls: This is largely a political hit job with fabricated or heavily distorted evidence\n\nGiven that Juan is no fool, the \"gross betrayal\" end of the spectrum should be very narrow or non-existent. Luna couldn't have been systematically stealing from the treasury for years without Diego de Daza or Isaac noticing something.\n\nLet me draft this table.\n\nTHE TRUTH ABOUT ÁLVARO DE LUNA\n\nContextual Constraints\n\nBefore drafting the table, let me establish what we know about Juan's capabilities:\n\nJuan's Safeguards:\n\nIsaac de Baeza runs an extensive intelligence network—he would notice gross corruption\n\nDiego de Daza manages the treasury with meticulous care—systematic embezzlement would appear in his ledgers\n\nJuan has personally reviewed major appointments and decisions throughout the campaign\n\nLuna has operated under Juan's direct observation for years, not in some distant province\n\nThe Council of Realms, Crown Marshalls, and other institutional reforms would expose obvious abuses\n\nJuan is not an absentee king manipulated by a favorite—he has been an active, engaged ruler\n\nWhat This Means:\n\nMassive theft from the treasury is essentially impossible—Diego would know\n\nOutright treason (plotting against Juan, foreign contacts) is nearly impossible—Isaac would know\n\nSystematic corruption on the scale described would have left traces Juan would have seen\n\nHowever: arrogance, favoritism, petty enrichment, and high-handedness are entirely plausible\n\nLuna has accumulated enormous power—the question is whether he abused it\n\nThe Truth Table\n\nRoll\nThe Reality\n1-5\nSignificant abuse, carefully hidden. Luna has not betrayed Juan, but he has exploited his position more than Juan realized. The treasury discrepancies are real—not the hundreds of thousands the nobles claim, but perhaps 30,000-40,000 florins over fifteen years, skimmed through intermediaries even Diego couldn't trace. The denied audiences are real—Luna decided who was \"worthy\" of the King's time based partly on personal grudges. The appointments were often qualified men, but qualified men who were also Luna's creatures. He convinced himself it was all for Juan's benefit. It wasn't. Juan should have watched more closely, but Luna was clever enough to keep the worst hidden.\n6-15\nPetty corruption, genuine arrogance. Luna has enriched himself beyond what his offices justify—but through legal gray areas, not outright theft. Gifts from petitioners. Land purchases at \"favorable\" prices from those seeking royal favor. Appointments that favored his allies. The treasury discrepancies are clerical errors or minor skimming by subordinates Luna didn't bother to stop. The real crime is arrogance: Luna genuinely came to see himself as indispensable and treated nobles with contempt they did not deserve. The evidence is a mix of legitimate grievances exaggerated into criminal accusations. Perhaps 30% truth, 70% political attack.\n16-30\nSystemic high-handedness, minimal corruption. Luna has not stolen significantly from the crown. Diego's books would show it if he had. But he has accumulated power jealously, denied access to those he considered unworthy or hostile, and made enemies through coldness and pride rather than crime. The \"evidence\" of corruption is mostly fabricated or distorted—small gifts inflated into bribes, normal administrative friction recast as persecution. But the obstruction charges have merit: Luna really did block nobles from reaching Juan, really did make himself a gatekeeper. His sin is pride, not greed. Perhaps 20% legitimate grievance, 80% political vendetta.\n31-50\nLoyal servant, imperfect man. Luna has served Juan faithfully for thirty years. He has enriched himself, yes—but largely through legitimate means: his offices, his lands, royal gifts freely given. The treasury is clean; Diego would stake his reputation on it. The appointments favored Luna's allies, but most were competent men. The denied audiences... some were petty, some were genuine prioritization. The \"evidence\" the nobles present is a careful construction: real documents taken out of context, testimony from men with grudges, clerical errors reframed as theft. Luna is guilty of being powerful and proud. He is not guilty of betraying his king. Perhaps 10% legitimate complaint, 90% political attack.\n51-70\nExemplary service, manufactured case. Luna's record is remarkably clean for a man who has held such power for so long. Isaac's network has watched him for years—at Juan's quiet instruction—and found nothing treasonous. Diego's ledgers balance. The appointments Luna made were genuinely the best candidates available, with his allies favored only when equally qualified. The \"corruption\" evidence is almost entirely fabricated: forged letters, perjured testimony, documents altered after the fact. The nobles have constructed an elaborate lie because the truth—that Luna is simply better at governance than they are—is intolerable to their pride.\n71-85\nFaithful unto fault. Luna has sacrificed everything for Juan—including his own reputation. He made enemies precisely because he refused to allow noble interference in royal policy. He blocked access to the King because most petitioners were wasting royal time. He appointed competent men regardless of blood because competence mattered more than lineage. The \"evidence\" is a tissue of lies, exaggerations, and deliberate misreadings. When examined closely, every charge collapses. The nobles know this—which is why they want a trial before their peers, not an impartial examination of facts.\n86-95\nMore loyal than wise. Luna has been scrupulously honest—perhaps too honest. He has made no effort to cultivate allies among the nobility, viewing such politicking as beneath him. He has kept meticulous records that prove his innocence—but also prove how much power he accumulated, which is itself the offense in noble eyes. Every florin is accounted for. Every appointment is documented. The nobles' \"evidence\" will not survive scrutiny—but they are counting on the trial being decided by politics, not evidence. Luna's real crime is being a commoner who outshone the great houses of Castile.\n96-100\nThe perfect servant, the perfect target. Luna has been almost superhumanly loyal and competent. Isaac has monitored him for years and found nothing—not from lack of trying, but because there is nothing to find. Diego can demonstrate that Luna has actually saved the treasury money through efficient administration. The nobles' case is a house of cards built on forged documents, bribed witnesses, and noble solidarity. But they have built it carefully, and in a trial before their peers, evidence may matter less than politics. Luna is guilty of one thing: being so good at his job that he made the nobility feel obsolete.\n\nRoll when ready.",

The \"evidence\" the nobles present is a careful construction: real documents taken out of context, testimony from men with grudges, clerical errors reframed as theft. Luna is guilty of being powerful and proud. He is not guilty of betraying his king. Perhaps 10% legitimate complaint, 90% political attack.\n\nNow, let me review what we established earlier:\n\nFrom the conspiracy rolls:\n- **Leader (Roll: 39):** Pedro de Stúñiga, Count of Plasencia — patient, calculating\n- **Allied Houses (Roll: 46):** Rodrigo Manrique + Fadrique Enríquez\n- **Goal (Roll: 10):** Luna's DEATH — framed as \"trial\" but intended outcome is execution\n- **Method (Roll: 69):** Slow strangulation — withdraw cooperation, starve resources, build case for trial, poison opinion, wait for king's return\n- **Status at Juan's Return (Roll: 68):** Conspiracy partially exposed — Luna knows outline but not full extent\n\nAnd from the arrival roll (21): United but aggressive. All three arrive together with larger escorts, presenting a formal petition demanding trial.\n\nNow, with the truth being that Luna is mostly innocent (10% legitimate, 90% political attack), what would intelligent nobles actually do?\n\nThe user is right - forging lots of documents is risky and stupid. If caught, they're guilty of treason themselves. These are intelligent men who have been plotting for months.\n\nWhat would their realistic strategy be?\n\n1. **Focus on the 10% legitimate grievances** - the real issues:\n   - Luna's accumulation of offices (documented fact, not fabrication)\n   - Denied audiences (some were real, can get testimony from genuinely aggrieved nobles)\n   - Luna's arrogance and treatment of nobles (real, witnessed by many)\n   - Favoritism in appointments (real, even if the appointees were competent)\n\n2. **Frame legitimate things as crimes** - not fabrication, but spin:\n   - Luna's wealth is legal but looks bad - \"how did a bastard become so rich?\"\n   - Luna's efficiency looks suspicious when you're predisposed to suspect him\n\nThese intelligent conspirators would build their case on genuine grievances, amplifying them through selective presentation and hostile interpretation rather than outright forgery. They'd leverage Luna's real flaws—his pride, his consolidation of power, his dismissiveness toward the nobility—while carefully avoiding the trap of fabricating evidence that could expose them as traitors.\n\nThe trial format itself serves their purposes better than any document ever could. They're counting on the political weight of accumulated resentment to do the work that proof cannot. Nobles who genuinely suffered slights, who lost positions to Luna's competent allies, who were turned away from his offices—these witnesses carry real grievances that don't require embellishment. The strategy is to make Luna's continued influence politically untenable, not necessarily to prove specific crimes beyond doubt.\n\nThe actual presentation would lean heavily on what's demonstrably true: his rapid accumulation of titles and wealth, the systematic exclusion of the traditional nobility from power, the king's increasing isolation from his peers. These facts, arranged to suggest overreach and corruption, become more persuasive than any forged documents could be. A few questionable witnesses might slip in, but the core case rests on legitimate constitutional concerns about concentration of power and the breakdown of proper counsel structures.\n\nYou're absolutely right. Let me reconsider this properly.\n\nReassessing the Situation\n\nRoll 47 establishes: Luna is a loyal servant, imperfect man. Perhaps 10% legitimate complaint, 90% political attack. The treasury is clean. Most appointments were competent. Some denied audiences were petty. He is guilty of being powerful and proud, not of betraying his king.\n\nThe conspiracy rolls established:\n\nGoal (Roll 10): Luna's DEATH via \"trial\"\n\nMethod (Roll 69): Slow strangulation—withdraw cooperation, poison opinion, build case\n\nStatus (Roll 68): Conspiracy partially exposed, both sides preparing\n\nThe arrival roll (21): United but aggressive, presenting demands\n\nWhat Intelligent Nobles Would Actually Do\n\nStúñiga is described as \"patient, calculating.\" He has been building this for months. He would not stake everything on forgeries that could be exposed and transform him from aggrieved noble into traitor.\n\nTheir realistic strategy would be:\n\n1. Lead With Undeniable Facts\n\nLuna's accumulation of offices: Constable, Grand Master of Santiago, Alcaide of multiple fortresses, Lord of ninety-three towns—all true, all legal, all alarming\n\nLuna's wealth: Perhaps 300,000-400,000 florins accumulated over thirty years—legitimate, but how does a minor Aragonese bastard become richer than most grandees?\n\nLuna's control of access: This happened, even if often for good reasons\n\n2. Real Testimony From Genuinely Aggrieved Parties\n\nManrique really was denied audience for months—the dispute was real, even if Luna had reasons\n\nOther nobles really did lose appointments to Luna's allies—even if those allies were competent\n\nNo need to fabricate when real resentment is abundant\n\n3. Frame the Political Argument, Not Criminal Charges\n\n\"No one man should hold such power\"—constitutional concern, not accusation\n\n\"The nobility has been excluded\"—true, even if intentional policy\n\n\"The King deserves counsel from his natural lords\"—cannot be disproven\n\n4. Demand Process, Not Proof\n\nA trial before noble peers, where politics matters more than evidence\n\nThe goal is to make Luna's position politically untenable, not to prove crimes\n\nEven acquittal damages Luna if the process is humiliating enough\n\nRevised Evidence Bundle\n\nGiven this, the documents they would actually present:\n\nBundle One: The Accumulation (Factual)\nA simple enumeration of Luna's offices, lands, titles, and estimated income. No accusations—just facts that speak for themselves. \"Let the King see what one man has gathered.\"\n\nBundle Two: Denied Audiences (Real Grievances)\nTestimony from nobles who genuinely sought royal audience and were turned away or delayed. Real names, real dates, real complaints. The reasons for denial are absent, making it look arbitrary.\n\nBundle Three: Appointments (Real, Spun)\nA list of appointments that went to Luna's known allies, alongside the noble candidates who were passed over. The appointees may have been qualified—but the pattern looks like favoritism.\n\nBundle Four: The Constitutional Argument\nNot evidence at all, but a legal brief: historical precedents for limiting powerful favorites, the rights of nobility to counsel their king, the dangers of one man holding multiple offices. This is the real weapon—political philosophy, not criminal accusation.\n\nBundle Five: Limited Testimony (Risky)\nPerhaps two or three servants or minor officials willing to speak against Luna—but carefully chosen, plausible complaints rather than sensational accusations. Enough to add color, not enough to stake everything on.\n\nWhat This Changes\n\nThe scene where Juan examines \"six bundles of evidence\" should be revised. Instead of treasury discrepancies (which Diego would immediately debunk) and forged letters (which are dangerous), the nobles present:\n\nFacts that are true but framed as accusations\n\nTestimony that is real but context-stripped\n\nPolitical arguments that cannot be \"disproven\" because they are opinions\n\nA demand for process (trial before peers) rather than proof\n\nTheir strategy is not \"prove Luna guilty of crimes\" but rather \"make Luna's position politically impossible.\"\n\nShall I rewrite the evidence scene with this revised understanding? The core dynamic remains—Juan examining their case, walking them to the garden, the conversation—but the nature of what they're presenting changes significantly.",

The nobles' goal is Luna's death via \"trial\" (Roll 10)\n4. Their method is slow strangulation (Roll 69)\n5. They arrived united but aggressive (Roll 21)\n\nSo now we need to replay the scene where the three lords enter the throne room, but with:\n- A more realistic presentation of their case (political arguments, real grievances stripped of context, facts framed as accusations)\n- Juan having Diego, Isaac, and Don Alonso present\n- The knowledge that their case is mostly political, not criminal\n\nLet me set the scene properly. The nobles came with large escorts, united, aggressive. They expect confrontation. But their \"evidence\" is actually political argument, not criminal proof.\n\nI should narrate their entrance, their presentation, and stop when they finish speaking so Juan can respond.\n\nTHE AUDIENCE — REVISED\n\nThe Alcázar of Toledo — November 22, 1439, Midday\n\nYou receive them in the great hall, seated on the throne of Castile. The chamber has been arranged with care: your guards line the walls in sufficient numbers to match their escorts outside. But you have also ensured that this is not merely a display of force.\n\nTo your right stands Diego de Daza, your chief financial administrator, ledger satchel at his side. His presence sends a message: the crown's accounts are open to scrutiny.\n\nTo your left stands Isaac de Baeza, emerging from his customary shadows into visible attendance. Another message: the crown sees what happens in its realm.\n\nNear the foot of the throne stands Don Alonso Pérez de Vivero, the Castilian representative to the Council of Realms—the man who carried your invitation to these lords. His presence bridges crown and Cortes.\n\nThe three lords enter together.\n\nPedro de Stúñiga, Count of Plasencia, walks in the center. Grey-bearded, composed, his face a mask of perfect courtesy. He wears black velvet trimmed with silver—understated wealth, calculated humility.\n\nRodrigo Manrique, Count of Paredes, walks to his right. Younger, harder, with a soldier's bearing. His jaw is set, his eyes fixed on you with barely concealed hostility.\n\nFadrique Enríquez, Admiral of Castile, walks to Stúñiga's left. The oldest of the three, white-haired, dignified. But uncertainty flickers in his eyes.\n\nThey stop at the appropriate distance and bow—correctly, but no deeper than protocol requires.\n\nStúñiga speaks.\n\n\"Your Majesty. We thank you for receiving us. We come as loyal subjects of the Crown, bearing concerns that we believe Your Majesty will wish to hear.\"\n\nHe does not produce a document. He does not speak of \"charges\" or \"evidence.\" His tone is measured, reasonable—a man presenting a petition, not an accusation.\n\n\"We wish to speak of the state of the realm. Of the concentration of power in a single hand. Of the ancient rights of the nobility to counsel their king. And of one man who has, perhaps without malice but certainly without restraint, placed himself between the Crown and its natural advisors.\"\n\nHe pauses, letting the words settle.\n\n\"We do not come as accusers, Your Majesty. We come as concerned subjects who have watched, for thirty years, as Don Álvaro de Luna accumulated offices, lands, and influence beyond anything seen in the history of Castile.\"\n\nManrique shifts impatiently, but Stúñiga continues in his measured tone.\n\n\"Constable of Castile. Grand Master of Santiago. Alcaide of seven royal fortresses. Lord of ninety-three towns and villages. Recipient of revenues exceeding one hundred thousand florins annually.\"\n\nHe spreads his hands.\n\n\"These are not accusations, Your Majesty. These are facts. Documented facts that any clerk in the realm can verify. We ask only that Your Majesty consider what it means for one man—any man, however loyal—to hold such power.\"\n\nNow Manrique speaks, unable to contain himself longer.\n\n\"I sought audience with Your Majesty for seventeen months, Your Majesty. Seventeen months, concerning a legitimate inheritance dispute. I was told the King was occupied. I was told my matter was not a priority. I was told to submit my petition to the Constable's staff.\"\n\nHis voice is bitter but controlled—real grievance, not theatrical rage.\n\n\"I am the Count of Paredes. My family has served the crown for six generations. And I could not see my king because one man decided I was unworthy of royal attention.\"\n\nStúñiga nods gravely.\n\n\"The Count of Paredes is not alone. Many noble houses have found the path to their sovereign... obstructed. We do not suggest that Don Álvaro acted from malice. Perhaps he believed he was protecting Your Majesty's time. Perhaps he believed his judgment superior to ours.\"\n\nA slight edge enters his voice.\n\n\"But it is not his judgment that should govern access to the King of Castile. That is a matter for the King alone—and for the ancient customs that have always granted the nobility the right to counsel their sovereign.\"\n\nThe Admiral speaks at last, his voice quiet and tired.\n\n\"Your Majesty, we are not here to condemn Don Álvaro as a criminal. We are here to ask whether it is wise—whether it is safe—for any single subject to hold such power. What happens when Your Majesty rides to war, as you have done so often and so gloriously? One man rules in your absence. One man decides who is heard and who is silenced. One man controls the treasury, the army, the appointments, the justice of the realm.\"\n\nHe meets your eyes.\n\n\"We do not doubt Don Álvaro's loyalty to Your Majesty. But loyalty to the King is not the same as loyalty to the kingdom. And the kingdom suffers when its natural lords are excluded from their rightful place.\"\n\nStúñiga takes up the thread again.\n\n\"We ask three things, Your Majesty. First: that the offices Don Álvaro has accumulated be distributed among several hands, as custom and prudence require. No single man should hold the Constableship, the Grand Mastership, and a dozen lesser offices simultaneously.\"\n\nHe raises a second finger.\n\n\"Second: that the nobility be restored to their rightful role as counselors to the Crown. Not to diminish royal authority—God forbid—but to ensure that Your Majesty hears many voices, not merely one.\"\n\nA third finger.\n\n\"Third: that these matters be discussed openly, before the Cortes, where the estates of the realm may speak and be heard. We do not seek secret arrangements or private bargains. We seek the light of public deliberation.\"\n\nHe bows his head slightly.\n\n\"This is our petition, Your Majesty. We believe it to be just, reasonable, and in keeping with the ancient constitution of Castile.\"\n\nThe three men wait.",

      "text": "Juan is probing their second demand - the restoration of nobility to their \"rightful role as counselors.\" He's asking them to be specific about what mechanism they envision. This is a shrewd question because:\n\n1. It forces them to reveal their actual intentions\n2. Any body they propose would likely be dominated by themselves\n3. It exposes the self-interested nature of their \"constitutional concerns\"\n4. Juan already HAS a Council of Realms - Don Alonso is standing right there\n\nThe nobles need to answer carefully. Stúñiga is the schemer, so he'll likely take the lead. They probably want something like:\n- A council of grandees with real power\n- Themselves on that council\n- The council having veto or approval authority over appointments, access, policy\n\nBut they have to be careful not to sound like they're trying to usurp royal authority. And they're standing in front of Don Alonso, who represents an existing advisory council that Juan created.\n\nLet me think about how each noble would respond:\n\nStúñiga: Would want to present this as restoring ancient rights, would propose a council of senior nobles, would frame it as \"advice\" while seeking real influence\n\nManrique: Would be more blunt - he wants the great houses to have direct access and influence\n\nThe Admiral: Would likely stay quiet or offer something moderate\n\nThe key tension here is that Juan has ALREADY created the Council of Realms - a deliberative body with representatives from all five kingdoms. The nobles are essentially asking for something that would compete with or supersede this institution, or they're unaware/dismissive of it.\n\nDon Alonso is standing right there. This creates an interesting dynamic.\n\nI should have Stúñiga respond carefully, proposing something that sounds reasonable but would effectively give the grandees power. Then Juan can probe further or point out the existing institutions.\n\nTHE RESPONSE\n\nStúñiga's expression flickers—just for an instant. The question is sharper than he expected. He was prepared to speak of principles; you are asking about mechanisms.\n\nHe recovers smoothly, but you notice him choosing his words with greater care.\n\n\"Your Majesty raises the essential question.\"\n\nHe glances at his companions, then continues.\n\n\"In the ancient days of Castile, the King was counseled by his ricos hombres—the great lords whose blood and service had earned them the right to speak in the royal presence. This was not a limitation on royal power, but a support for it. The King decided; the lords advised. The King commanded; the lords provided wisdom born of their own governance of lands and men.\"\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\"We propose a restoration of this custom. A council of the senior nobility—the grandees of Castile, the heads of the ancient houses—who would meet regularly with Your Majesty to discuss matters of state. Not to command. Not to veto. But to ensure that the King hears the concerns of the realm from those who know it best.\"\n\nManrique cuts in, less diplomatic.\n\n\"Men of blood, Your Majesty. Men whose families have held these lands for centuries. Not clerks and accountants elevated beyond their station. Not foreign merchants appointed to govern Aragonese territory. Not...\"\n\nHe stops himself, but the implication is clear: not upstarts like Luna.\n\nStúñiga smoothly resumes.\n\n\"The composition of such a council would, naturally, be for Your Majesty to determine. We suggest only that it include representatives of the great houses—Stúñiga, Manrique, Enríquez, Mendoza, Guzmán, Velasco, and others of similar standing. Men whose stake in the kingdom's welfare is written in their blood and their lands.\"\n\nThe Admiral adds, more cautiously:\n\n\"Such a council would not replace Your Majesty's other advisors. The learned men, the administrators, the clergy—all have their place. We ask only that the nobility also have a place. A formal place, with regular audience, where our concerns may be heard before decisions are made rather than after.\"\n\nStúñiga nods.\n\n\"As for what should receive Your Majesty's attention—we would not presume to dictate. But a council of grandees could advise on such matters. Which petitions merit royal consideration. Which disputes require royal judgment. Which appointments touch upon the interests of the realm as a whole.\"\n\nHe spreads his hands in a gesture of reasonableness.\n\n\"Not gatekeeping, Your Majesty. Not obstruction. Merely... counsel. From those whose experience and lineage qualify them to offer it.\"\n\nHis eyes meet yours.\n\n\"The alternative is what we have now: one man deciding all such matters alone. And that man, however capable, is not of the blood. He does not understand what it means to hold lands that have been in one's family for three hundred years. He does not feel the obligations of lordship as we feel them.\"\n\nA slight pause.\n\n\"We mean no disrespect to Don Álvaro. But a clerk, however elevated, sees the kingdom as a ledger to be balanced. A lord sees it as a trust to be preserved.\"\n\nDon Alonso Pérez de Vivero shifts almost imperceptibly at the edge of your vision. The Council of Realms—the institution Juan created, with elected representatives from each kingdom—has not been mentioned. These lords are proposing something quite different: a council of grandees, selected by blood rather than election, representing noble interests rather than the realms as a whole.\n\nThe three lords wait for your response.",

      "text": "The nobles are in a tricky position. They came with three demands:\n1. Distribute Luna's offices among several hands\n2. Restore nobility to counselor role (they proposed a council of grandees)\n3. Discuss openly before the Cortes\n\nNow Juan is essentially asking: \"So you want Luna gone and replaced by a council of grandees?\"\n\nThis is a trap of sorts. If they say yes, they're admitting this is about removing Luna and installing themselves in power. If they say no, they undermine their own proposal.\n\nLet me think about how each would respond based on their characters:\n\n**Stúñiga** - Patient, calculating. He would recognize the trap. He would try to frame it more carefully - not \"removal\" but \"redistribution of offices.\" Not \"replacing Luna\" but \"restoring the ancient constitution.\"\n\n**Manrique** - Hot-headed, personal hatred of Luna. He might blurt out something more direct - yes, Luna must go.\n\n**The Admiral** - Uncertain, the least committed. He might try to moderate, focus on the institutional reform rather than Luna personally.\n\nThe roll was 32 - Grudging acceptance. They're not fully convinced by Juan's approach, still suspicious, but accepting the process. So they would respond cautiously but still push their position.\n\nGiven the dynamics:\n- Stúñiga would try to thread the needle carefully\n- Manrique would be more direct\n- The Admiral would try to soften\n\nLet me write this scene.\n\nTHE CLARIFICATION\n\nStúñiga hesitates.\n\nIt is a small thing—a half-breath of pause before speaking—but you notice it. The Count of Plasencia is a careful man, and he recognizes the ground shifting beneath his feet.\n\nYou have restated his proposal in starker terms than he used. Removal of Álvaro. Installment of a council. Clean. Direct. And suddenly rather naked in its ambition.\n\nHe chooses his words with precision.\n\n\"Your Majesty summarizes... broadly.\" A diplomatic smile. \"We do not speak of removal as such. Don Álvaro has committed no crime that would warrant dismissal from royal service. We speak of redistribution—of offices that have accumulated in one hand being spread among several, as was always the custom before.\"\n\nHe gestures with an open palm.\n\n\"The Constableship is a great office. Let it remain with Don Álvaro, if Your Majesty wishes. But must he also be Grand Master of Santiago? Must he also hold seven alcaidías? Must he also control access to the royal presence?\"\n\nHe shakes his head.\n\n\"These responsibilities could be shared. The Grand Mastership might go to a knight of proven valor. The fortresses might be entrusted to lords whose lands adjoin them. The role of counselor might be filled by many voices rather than one.\"\n\nManrique, predictably, is less subtle.\n\n\"Let us speak plainly, Your Majesty. Luna has made himself indispensable. That is his genius and his crime. He has arranged matters so that to remove him from any office appears to threaten the whole edifice of government.\"\n\nHis voice hardens.\n\n\"But he is not indispensable. Castile governed itself for centuries before Álvaro de Luna, and it will govern itself for centuries after. What we propose is not revolution—it is restoration. The kingdom ruled as it was meant to be ruled, by the King and his natural lords, not by a single favorite who answers to no one.\"\n\nThe Admiral clears his throat, attempting moderation.\n\n\"What my colleagues mean, Your Majesty, is that we seek balance. Not the destruction of Don Álvaro, but the... tempering of his influence. A council of grandees would not replace him—it would complement him. He would remain an advisor, if Your Majesty wishes. But he would be one voice among many, not the only voice that matters.\"\n\nHe glances at Stúñiga, who nods approvingly at this formulation.\n\n\"When Your Majesty rides to war against the Ottomans,\" the Admiral continues, \"the realm would not be left in one man's hands. It would be governed by a council acting in Your Majesty's name—a council representing the great houses, the ancient blood, the collective wisdom of Castile's lords.\"\n\nStúñiga takes up the thread again.\n\n\"Such a council would be accountable, Your Majesty. If one member overreaches, the others restrain him. If one grows corrupt, the others expose him. No single man can check himself—that is the lesson of history. But a council of peers, each watching the others, each jealous of his own prerogatives... such a body governs wisely because it cannot govern otherwise.\"\n\nHe pauses, then adds with careful emphasis:\n\n\"And when Your Majesty returns victorious from the East, you would find your kingdom in good order. Not dependent on the health or honesty of one man, but secured by the collective stewardship of your greatest lords.\"\n\nThe three men stand in silence, their proposal now fully articulated.\n\nA council of grandees. The great houses restored to power. Luna reduced from sole regent to one advisor among many—if he is permitted to remain at all.\n\nAnd notably absent from their vision: the Council of Realms. The Crown Marshalls. The elected representatives. The institutional reforms Juan has spent years building.",

      "text": "Juan is proposing something quite different from what the nobles wanted. Let me analyze this:\n\n**What the nobles asked for:**\n- A council of grandees (the great noble houses)\n- Redistribution of Luna's offices among the nobility\n- Noble blood determining who advises the King\n- Essentially: noble power restored, Luna diminished or removed\n\n**What Juan is proposing:**\n- Luna retires and surrenders ALL offices (they get this)\n- A regency council of THREE administrators chosen by the Cortes\n- One from nobles, one from burghers (commoners/merchants), one from clergy\n- Each chamber of the Cortes chooses one representative\n\n**Why this is NOT what they wanted:**\n- They wanted grandees specifically, not elected representatives\n- They wanted noble dominance, not equal representation with burghers and clergy\n- The burghers having equal voice with nobles is almost insulting to their sense of blood and privilege\n- This is essentially Juan's existing reform philosophy extended, not a return to \"ancient customs\"\n- The Cortes electing means they don't control who gets chosen\n- A burgher administrator would be exactly the kind of \"clerk elevated beyond his station\" Manrique just complained about\n\n**Why this MIGHT satisfy them:**\n- Luna is gone completely - surrenders ALL offices\n- They do get ONE seat on the council (the noble representative)\n- It's a council, not one man - their stated concern\n- It's through the Cortes, which gives it legitimacy\n- The Admiral and perhaps Stúñiga might see this as a reasonable compromise\n- Manrique will almost certainly hate it\n\n**The core tension:**\nThey dressed up their demands in constitutional language (\"no one man should hold such power\") but their real goal was noble restoration. Juan has taken their constitutional argument seriously and proposed a genuinely constitutional solution - but one that does NOT privilege the nobility as they hoped.\n\nThey are trapped by their own rhetoric. They can't openly say \"we want noble dominance\" when they framed it as \"we want balance and counsel.\"\n\nNow I need to draft the table showing how each faction will likely respond to this proposal.\n\nPERSUASION: The Counter-Proposal\n\nEvaluation of the Situation\n\nWhat Juan Has Proposed:\n\nLuna retires completely—surrenders ALL offices\n\nA regency council of three administrators chosen by the Cortes\n\nOne noble, one burgher, one clergyman—each chamber elects its own\n\nThe realm represented through its estates, not through blood alone\n\nWhat the Nobles Actually Wanted:\n\nLuna removed or diminished (they get this—completely)\n\nA council of grandees—the great noble houses restored to dominance\n\nBlood and lineage determining who advises the King\n\nNoble supremacy, dressed in constitutional language\n\nThe Trap Juan Has Set:\nThe nobles framed their demands as constitutional principle: \"no one man should hold such power,\" \"many voices, not one,\" \"counsel from those who know the realm.\" Juan has taken their rhetoric seriously and proposed a genuinely constitutional solution—but one that does NOT privilege the nobility as they hoped.\n\nThey cannot openly object without revealing that their true goal was noble power, not balanced counsel. The burghers and clergy having equal voice is precisely what they did not want. Manrique just complained about \"clerks and accountants elevated beyond their station\"—and now Juan proposes giving such men formal seats on the regency council.\n\nFactors in Play\n\nSuccess Factors:\n\nLuna is gone COMPLETELY—this exceeds their stated demands\n\nThey get a council, which they asked for\n\nThe noble estate gets one seat—they are represented\n\nJuan has agreed with their core stated principle (\"power should not be concentrated\")\n\nThis is through the Cortes—legitimate, public, constitutional\n\nRefusing this makes them look like they want noble dominance, not balance\n\nThe Admiral wanted compromise; this is a generous compromise\n\nStúñiga is pragmatic—Luna's total removal is a significant victory\n\nJuan's calm, reasonable demeanor throughout has been disarming\n\nFailure Factors:\n\nThey wanted a council of GRANDEES, not elected representatives\n\nBurghers having equal voice with nobles is deeply offensive to their pride\n\nThis continues Juan's reform philosophy, not a return to \"ancient customs\"\n\nManrique specifically complained about \"clerks elevated beyond their station\"\n\nThe Cortes electing means the nobles don't control who serves\n\nOne seat out of three is minority representation, not dominance\n\nThis looks like Juan outmaneuvered them using their own rhetoric\n\nStúñiga may recognize the trap and resent being caught in it\n\nThey brought seven signatures—those other houses will ask what was gained\n\nManrique's hatred is personal; Luna's comfortable retirement may not satisfy\n\nThe Core Dynamic:\nThey must choose: accept a genuine constitutional reform that gives them Luna's removal but not noble supremacy, or reject it and reveal that \"balance\" was never their true goal.\n\nThe Persuasion Table\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-5\nManrique explodes. The Count of Paredes sees through the proposal instantly—and cannot contain his fury. \"Burghers? You would seat merchants beside the grandees of Castile to govern the realm?\" He steps forward, voice rising. \"We did not come here to be mocked, Your Majesty. We came for justice, and we are offered insult.\" Stúñiga tries to intervene, but Manrique is beyond control. The united front holds—but only because Manrique has dragged them all into open confrontation. The negotiation has failed.\n6-12\nStúñiga recognizes the trap. The Count of Plasencia's eyes narrow. He sees what you have done—used their own rhetoric to justify something they never intended. His voice is cool, careful. \"Your Majesty's proposal is... creative. But it does not address our concerns. We spoke of counsel from those who understand lordship, who hold the realm in trust through blood and heritage. A merchant from Burgos, however prosperous, does not possess such understanding.\" He counter-proposes: the council should be drawn from grandees only, or nobles should hold two seats of three. The negotiation continues, but they have not accepted.\n13-22\nUnited rejection, polite form. The three lords exchange glances. Stúñiga speaks for all. \"Your Majesty offers much, and we are grateful for the removal of Don Álvaro from his offices. But the composition of the council... this requires further discussion. Perhaps the estates might be represented differently. Perhaps the noble estate, bearing the greatest responsibility for the realm's defense, should hold greater weight.\" They are not refusing outright, but they are not accepting either. They want to negotiate the terms—and they want noble dominance in whatever emerges.\n23-35\nGrudging consideration. Stúñiga is silent for a long moment, calculating. Luna gone completely—that is more than they demanded. A council instead of one man—that is what they asked for. But burghers and clergy as equals... He glances at Manrique, whose face is dark with suppressed anger, then at the Admiral, who looks oddly thoughtful. \"Your Majesty's proposal deserves careful consideration,\" he says finally. \"We would wish to consult among ourselves, and with the other houses who signed our petition, before giving a final answer.\" They are not accepting—but they are not rejecting either. They want time to find a counter-move.\n36-50\nThe Admiral wavers. Enríquez speaks before Stúñiga can. \"Luna surrenders all offices? All of them?\" There is something almost hungry in his voice. The Admiralty, controlled by Luna's influence for years, would be free. \"Your Majesty, this is... more than we asked.\" Stúñiga shoots him a sharp look—too much, too soon—but the Admiral continues. \"The composition of the council is unusual, yes. But if it means Don Álvaro truly steps aside...\" He trails off, but his meaning is clear. He can be satisfied. The united front is cracking.\n51-65\nStúñiga calculates advantage. The Count of Plasencia is a pragmatist. Luna gone completely. A council where nobles hold one-third of the power—less than he wanted, but more than they had under Luna. And the proposal comes from the King, which means accepting it is loyalty, not surrender. He can present this to the other signatories as a victory: \"We demanded Luna's removal and a council; we received both.\" His voice is measured when he speaks. \"Your Majesty's proposal addresses many of our concerns. The details of implementation would require discussion, but... the principle is sound.\" Manrique looks betrayed. The Admiral looks relieved. The united front is fracturing.\n66-78\nAcceptance with reservations. Stúñiga bows his head. \"Your Majesty has heard our concerns and responded with wisdom. The removal of Don Álvaro from all his offices is more than we dared hope. A council of the estates is... not what we envisioned, but it achieves the balance we sought.\" He pauses. \"We would ask only that the noble representative be chosen from among the grandees—the heads of the great houses—rather than any knight or hidalgo the Cortes might select. Blood must have its weight.\" A minor concession that preserves noble dignity. The Admiral nods eagerly. Even Manrique, though scowling, does not object. They are accepting.\n79-88\nThe trap closes. They have no counter-move. Luna's complete removal exceeds their stated demands. A council of estates embodies their stated principles. To reject it, they would have to admit they wanted noble supremacy, not balance—and that admission would cost them the support of moderate nobles who signed their petition in good faith. Stúñiga sees this. His expression flickers—frustration, perhaps, or grudging respect—before settling into diplomatic acceptance. \"Your Majesty's wisdom exceeds our expectations. We accept.\" Manrique looks like he has swallowed something bitter, but he does not dissent. The crisis is resolved—on Juan's terms.\n89-95\nOutmaneuvered and grateful. The Admiral steps forward, something like wonder in his voice. \"Your Majesty... this is just. This is what we should have asked for from the beginning.\" He turns to his companions. \"Don Álvaro removed. A council of the estates. The realm represented, not ruled by one man's whim. Is this not what we wanted?\" Stúñiga hesitates—he knows he has been outplayed—but the Admiral's genuine enthusiasm is infectious. Even Manrique cannot sustain his anger in the face of total victory on the Luna question. They accept, and they accept gratefully, which transforms them from successful rebels into loyal petitioners whose concerns were heard.\n96-100\nComplete victory. Your proposal lands with the force of revelation. The nobles came prepared for confrontation; they find a king who listens, agrees, and offers more than they asked—but shaped to his own design. Stúñiga recognizes brilliance when he sees it. He bows deeply—more deeply than protocol requires. \"Your Majesty has shown us that our fears were misplaced. We doubted the King's willingness to hear us; we find a King who hears more clearly than we speak.\" The Admiral is visibly moved. Manrique is silent, his grievance somehow dissolved. When they depart, they depart as men who have been reminded why they are loyal. Word will spread: the King dismissed Luna completely, established a council of estates, resolved a noble revolt without a drop of blood—and emerged stronger than before.\n\nRoll when ready.",

Something loosens behind his eyes—tension draining away, replaced by something almost like wonder. Luna gone. Completely gone. The Admiralty free of the Constable's shadow for the first time in decades. His lips part slightly, but he does not speak. He is afraid to break the moment.\n\nStúñiga is harder to read. His expression remains composed, but you see the calculation happening behind his eyes. He came prepared for battle; he finds surrender—but a surrender that does not taste like victory. Luna removed, yes. A council, yes. But not his council. Not a council of grandees restored to their ancient rights. A council of estates, where merchants sit beside lords, where a bishop's voice weighs equal to a count's.\n\nHe sees what you have done. Used his own rhetoric—\"many voices,\" \"balanced counsel,\" \"no one man\"—to justify something he never intended.\n\nAnd yet.\n\nLuna is gone. Completely gone. That is more than the petition demanded. That is more than they dared hope when they rode into Toledo this morning.\n\nManrique's jaw works silently. His hands clench and unclench at his sides. You see the struggle in him—the hunger for Luna's blood warring with the reality that Luna's total removal is, in fact, what he asked for. Retirement is not execution. But it is also not nothing.\n\nThe silence stretches.\n\nThen Stúñiga bows his head.\n\n\"Your Majesty has heard our concerns and responded with wisdom.\"\n\nHis voice is measured, careful—a man accepting terms he did not write.\n\n\"The removal of Don Álvaro from all his offices is more than we dared hope. A council of the estates is...\"\n\nHe pauses, searching for the right word.\n\n\"...not what we envisioned. But it achieves the balance we sought. Power distributed rather than concentrated. Many voices rather than one.

A negotiator seeking a face-saving concession.\n\n\"The noble representative on this council should be chosen from among the grandees—the heads of the great houses whose blood and heritage qualify them to speak for the nobility as a whole. Not any knight or hidalgo whom the Cortes might select for reasons of faction or convenience.\"\n\nHe spreads his hands.\n\n\"The burghers will send a merchant of substance. The clergy will send a bishop of standing. Let the nobility likewise be represented by one whose rank and lineage command respect. A Count, a Duke, a Marquis—a man whose voice carries the weight of centuries.\"\n\nThe Admiral nods eagerly at this formulation. Yes, this is acceptable. This preserves dignity. This allows them to return to the other signatories and claim victory: Luna is gone, and a grandee will sit on the regency council.\n\nEven Manrique, though his expression remains dark, does not object. His hatred was for Luna, not for the constitutional details. If Luna is truly removed—truly stripped of everything—then perhaps the manner of governance matters less than he thought.\n\nStúñiga waits for your response to his single reservation.",

Not explicitly agreeing to Stúñiga's request that the noble representative MUST be a grandee, but implying trust that the nobles will choose well\n2. Inviting them to dine together - a significant gesture of reconciliation\n3. Asking about their personal affairs - humanizing the encounter, treating them as subjects rather than adversaries\n\nThis is a masterful diplomatic move. He's:\n- Not giving them the explicit guarantee they asked for (the Cortes could still choose anyone)\n- But making them feel heard and trusted\n- Breaking bread together signals the crisis is over\n- Personal conversation reminds them they are his lords, not his enemies\n\nLet me evaluate the factors:\n\n**Success Factors:**\n- The crisis has essentially been resolved - Luna gone, council established\n- They got 90% of what they wanted (Luna's complete removal)\n- Juan's response to the grandee request is gracious without being binding\n- Breaking bread is a powerful gesture of reconciliation in medieval culture\n- Juan is treating them as trusted lords, not defeated rebels\n- The Admiral already seems relieved and eager to move on\n- Personal interest in their estates is flattering\n- They need to save face with the other signatories - dining with the King helps\n- Stúñiga is pragmatic - a meal with the King is a political asset\n- The tension has been defused; continuing confrontation gains them nothing\n\n**Failure Factors:**\n- Manrique's hatred is personal and may not be assuaged by dinner\n- Juan did NOT explicitly agree to the grandee requirement - Stúñiga may notice\n- Some may see the invitation as premature - they haven't formally agreed yet\n- Pride may prevent immediate warmth after coming prepared for battle\n- The other four signatories are not present - what will they think?\n- Manrique may feel Luna's comfortable retirement is insufficient justice\n- The shift from confrontation to conviviality may feel too abrupt\n\n- They might interpret the meal as a calculated move to splinter their coalition\n\nThe real test now is whether they can genuinely shift from adversarial to cordial. The substantive terms are settled—Luna's removal is done, the council is formed. What remains is whether the relationship itself can heal, or if they'll maintain their guard despite the apparent resolution.\n\nPERSUASION: Breaking Bread\n\nEvaluation of the Situation\n\nWhat Juan Is Doing:\n\nDeflecting the explicit guarantee about grandees—trusting the nobles to \"choose well\" without binding the Cortes\n\nPivoting from adversarial negotiation to social warmth\n\nInviting them to dine—a powerful gesture of reconciliation\n\nAsking about their estates—treating them as trusted lords, not defeated rebels\n\nThe Subtext:\nBreaking bread together in medieval culture is significant. It signals that the conflict is over, that these men remain within the King's peace, that they are subjects in good standing rather than rebels granted grudging terms. It also makes it much harder for them to maintain hostility—one does not dine with a man and then plot against him. Not easily.\n\nWhat They Must Decide:\nDo they accept the pivot from confrontation to conciliation? Or do they insist on formalizing terms before allowing the mood to soften?\n\nFactors in Play\n\nSuccess Factors:\n\nThe substantive crisis is resolved—Luna gone, council established\n\nThey received more than their petition demanded\n\nJuan's response to the grandee request was gracious, not dismissive\n\nThe Admiral is already relieved and eager to move past confrontation\n\nStúñiga is pragmatic—dining with the King is a political asset\n\nPersonal interest in their estates is flattering and humanizing\n\nMedieval culture values hospitality; refusing a king's table is awkward\n\nThey need to report success to the other signatories—dining with the King proves royal favor restored\n\nMaintaining hostility after victory gains them nothing\n\nJuan has been calm, reasonable, and generous throughout\n\nFailure Factors:\n\nManrique's grievance is personal—seventeen months denied audience, years of humiliation\n\nJuan did NOT explicitly agree to the grandee requirement—Stúñiga may notice the evasion\n\nThe shift from confrontation to conviviality may feel too abrupt for comfort\n\nPride may require them to maintain dignity rather than accept warmth too quickly\n\nThe other four signatories are absent—they may feel they cannot celebrate without consulting them\n\nSome may suspect the invitation is designed to divide them\n\nFormal agreement has not been sealed—dining first may seem premature\n\nManrique may see Luna's comfortable retirement as insufficient justice\n\nThe Persuasion Table\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-5\nManrique refuses. The Count of Paredes steps back, his face hard. \"I did not come to dine, Your Majesty. I came for justice.\" He will not break bread while Luna lives in comfort at Escalona. He will not pretend reconciliation while his grievance festers. Stúñiga tries to smooth things over, but Manrique's rejection poisons the moment. The other two cannot accept warmly while their ally stands apart. The invitation hangs in the air, awkward and declined.\n6-12\nStúñiga demurs politely. The Count of Plasencia bows. \"Your Majesty is gracious. But perhaps we should first formalize what has been discussed—commit the terms to writing, inform the other lords who signed our petition. We would not wish to celebrate prematurely.\" It is a diplomatic refusal, citing propriety rather than hostility. But it is still a refusal. They are not ready to break bread. Not yet.\n13-22\nCautious acceptance. The three lords exchange glances. Stúñiga nods slowly. \"Your Majesty honors us.\" But the acceptance is formal, not warm. They will dine because refusing a king's invitation is awkward, not because they feel reconciled. The meal will be polite, careful, full of courteous nothings. The crisis is resolved, but trust is not rebuilt.\n23-35\nThe Admiral accepts eagerly; the others follow. Enríquez steps forward before his companions can respond. \"Your Majesty, we would be honored.\" His relief is palpable—the confrontation is over, the nightmare ending. Stúñiga, seeing the Admiral commit, can hardly refuse. Even Manrique, outnumbered and unwilling to stand alone, acquiesces with a curt nod. They will dine—but the warmth is uneven.\n36-50\nGrudging warmth. Stúñiga permits himself a small smile—the first genuine expression you have seen from him. \"Your Majesty is gracious. We would be honored to dine.\" The words are formal, but something has shifted. The battle is over; time to discover what peace looks like. Manrique remains stiff, but he does not refuse. The Admiral visibly relaxes. The meal will be awkward at first, but the ice is breaking.\n51-65\nRelief transforms the moment. The invitation lands like a key turning in a lock. Stúñiga's careful mask slips; beneath it, you glimpse exhaustion and something like gratitude. They came prepared for war; they found a king who listened. The Admiral actually smiles. Even Manrique's rigid posture softens slightly. \"We would be honored, Your Majesty,\" Stúñiga says, and for the first time, he sounds like he means it. The meal will be a true beginning of reconciliation.\n66-78\nStúñiga sees the opportunity. The Count of Plasencia is a politician to his bones. He recognizes what is being offered: not just a meal, but rehabilitation. They entered as near-rebels; they will leave as loyal lords who brought legitimate concerns and were heard. He bows deeply. \"Your Majesty does us great honor. We accept with gratitude.\" His tone invites the others to follow, and they do. When they sit to eat, conversation flows more easily than anyone expected. Old grievances do not disappear—but they begin to fade.\n79-88\nThe tension dissolves. Something breaks in the room—the accumulated hostility of months of conspiracy, the fear of confrontation, the weight of what might have happened. The Admiral laughs, a surprised sound even to himself. \"Dine with the King. Yes. That is... yes.\" Stúñiga's smile becomes genuine. Even Manrique, though he does not smile, unclenches his fists. They accept, and they accept warmly. The meal becomes something unexpected: three lords rediscovering that their king is a man they can speak with, not merely a throne to petition.\n89-95\nGenuine reconciliation. The invitation works a small miracle. They came as adversaries; they sit as subjects. Over food and wine, conversation turns from politics to life—their estates, their families, their concerns for the realm. Stúñiga speaks of difficulties with his tenants. The Admiral mentions his grandson's interest in the sea. Even Manrique, slowly, begins to thaw—telling a story of a hunting mishap that draws surprised laughter. When they depart hours later, something has changed. They are not friends. But they are no longer enemies.\n96-100\nA feast of restoration. The meal becomes something none of them expected: a genuine moment of healing. Juan's interest in their estates proves sincere, his questions thoughtful, his manner warm without being false. Stúñiga finds himself speaking frankly about the burdens of lordship. The Admiral opens up about his fears for the realm. Manrique—Manrique tells the story of his seventeen-month wait for audience, but tells it now as a grievance resolved rather than a wound still bleeding. When they rise from the table, hours later, something has been built. Not just a political settlement, but the beginning of trust. Word will spread: the King broke bread with the men who challenged Luna, and parted as friends.\n\nRoll when ready.",

      "text": "The Alcázar of Toledo — November 22, 1439, Afternoon\n\nThe Count of Plasencia's expression flickers—just for an instant—at your gracious pivot. You see him processing: the implicit deflection of his request for a guaranteed grandee, the sudden warmth, the invitation to break bread.\n\nHe is too experienced to be swept along.\n\n\"Your Majesty is most gracious.\"\n\nStúñiga bows, the gesture correct and respectful. But when he straightens, his tone carries careful reservation.\n\n\"We are honored by the invitation. Truly. But perhaps...\"\n\nHe glances at his companions, then back to you.\n\n\"Perhaps we should first formalize what has been discussed. Commit the terms to writing. Inform the other lords whose names appear on our petition—Alba, Astorga, Benavente, Valdecorneja. They trusted us to speak for them. We would not wish to celebrate before we can assure them that their concerns have been addressed.\"\n\nThe Admiral's face falls slightly. He was ready to accept, ready to let the tension drain away over wine and conversation. But Stúñiga is the leader here, and his caution prevails.\n\nManrique says nothing, but his rigid posture suggests he is not displeased by the delay. For him, perhaps, accepting the King's hospitality too quickly would feel like surrender rather than victory.\n\nStúñiga continues, his voice smooth and diplomatic.\n\n\"Once the terms are recorded—the removal of Don Álvaro from his offices, the establishment of the council, the method of selection—we would be honored to dine with Your Majesty. To celebrate what has been achieved. To demonstrate to the realm that the King and his nobles stand united.\"\n\nHe spreads his hands.\n\n\"We ask only for a little time, Your Majesty. A day, perhaps two, to draft the necessary documents and send word to our fellow petitioners. Then we will gladly accept your hospitality—with full hearts rather than uncertain ones.\"\n\nThe three lords stand in silence, waiting.\n\nIt is a polite refusal. Stúñiga is not rejecting reconciliation—he is deferring it until the political settlement is secured in writing. Until he can be certain that today's words will not be walked back tomorrow.\n\nPragmatic. Careful. And perhaps wise.\n\nBut also a reminder: these men came to Toledo as a coalition, and they will not allow themselves to be separated from that coalition by a king's charm.",

Juan is now seeing them out politely, shaking hands, and will draft the formal decree.\n\nThis is a good stopping point for this scene. I should narrate their departure and then set up what comes next - the drafting of the decree, perhaps consultation with advisors, and the resolution of this crisis.\n\nLet me narrate this briefly and then ask what Juan wants to do next.\n\nTHE DEPARTURE\n\nThe Alcázar of Toledo — November 22, 1439, Late Afternoon\n\nYou rise from the throne and descend the steps—a gesture that does not go unnoticed. Kings do not typically walk petitioners to the door.\n\nStúñiga's hand is dry and firm, his grip correct. His eyes meet yours for a moment—calculating still, but something else there too. Respect, perhaps. Or the wariness of a man who has discovered his opponent is more formidable than expected.\n\n\"Your Majesty.\"\n\nManrique's handshake is stiffer, his jaw still tight. But he takes your hand, which is itself a concession. A month ago, he might have refused. His grievance is not healed—Luna's comfortable retirement at Escalona will gnaw at him—but it has been acknowledged. That matters.\n\n\"Your Majesty.\"\n\nThe Admiral's hand trembles slightly. He is the oldest of the three, and this day has cost him something. But his eyes, when they meet yours, hold genuine relief.\n\n\"Your Majesty. Thank you.\"\n\nThree words. More honest than anything Stúñiga has said all day.\n\nYou walk with them to the great doors of the hall. Your guards fall in behind, a respectful distance. Diego de Daza and Isaac de Baeza remain where they stood, watching. Don Alonso Pérez de Vivero hovers near the throne, uncertain whether to follow.\n\nAt the threshold, Stúñiga turns.\n\n\"We will await Your Majesty's decree. And we will inform our fellow petitioners of what has been discussed today.\" A pause. \"I believe they will be... satisfied.\"\n\nIt is as close to an admission of victory as he will offer.\n\nThe three lords pass through the doors, their retainers falling in around them. You hear the clatter of boots on stone, the murmur of voices, the sounds of a great household in motion.\n\nThen they are gone.\n\nThe Aftermath\n\nThe hall feels suddenly empty. The afternoon light slants through the high windows, catching dust motes in the air. The fire crackles in the great hearth.\n\nDiego de Daza approaches, his ledger satchel still clutched under his arm.\n\n\"Your Majesty... that was well done.\"\n\nIsaac de Baeza materializes from somewhere, his expression unreadable as always.\n\n\"The decree will need careful drafting. The terms were spoken, not written. There is room for... interpretation.\"\n\nDon Alonso Pérez de Vivero clears his throat.\n\n\"The Cortes will need to be summoned, Your Majesty. For the estates to elect their representatives to this new council. That will take time—weeks, perhaps a month or more, depending on how quickly the writs can be sent and the members assembled.\"\n\nHe hesitates.\n\n\"And there is the matter of Don Álvaro. He waits at Escalona. He will need to be informed of... of what has been decided.\"\n\nThe three men wait for your instructions.",

      "text": "Juan is asking his advisors for their honest assessment of how he handled the situation. He's worried that by being conciliatory, he may have encouraged future demands from the nobility. This is a legitimate concern - the nobles came with a coordinated petition, essentially forcing Juan's hand, and they got what they wanted (Luna removed, a council established).\n\nLet me think about how each advisor would respond based on their character:\n\n**Diego de Daza** - Financial administrator, practical, focused on stability and governance. He would likely see the outcome as pragmatic - a potential civil conflict avoided, the realm stable, the treasury intact.\n\n**Isaac de Baeza** - Spymaster, sees threats and plots. He would be more cautious, perhaps warning that the nobles have learned that coordinated pressure works.\n\n**Don Alonso Pérez de Vivero** - Cortes representative, a letrado, understands noble politics. He has a unique perspective as someone who bridges crown and nobility.\n\nThis is a good moment for genuine counsel from these men, not just agreement with whatever Juan says. They should offer different perspectives.\n\nI should NOT generate dialogue for Juan or have him make decisions. I should present their counsel and let the player respond.\n\nTHE ADVISORS' COUNSEL\n\nThe Alcázar of Toledo — November 22, 1439, Evening\n\nThe three men exchange glances. Your question hangs in the air—honest, uncertain, the doubt of a king who wonders if wisdom looked too much like weakness.\n\nIsaac de Baeza speaks first.\n\n\"They came expecting confrontation, Your Majesty. They came armored in grievances, with seven signatures and months of preparation. They expected you to defend Luna, to reject their petition, to give them the righteous battle they had rehearsed.\"\n\nHis dark eyes are steady.\n\n\"Instead, you agreed with them. You took their rhetoric—'balance,' 'many voices,' 'no one man'—and gave it back to them shaped to your purpose. Luna removed, yes. But a council of estates, not grandees. The Cortes electing, not the great houses selecting.\"\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\"They won their stated goal. But they did not win what they truly wanted: noble supremacy restored. Stúñiga knows this. That is why he would not stay to dine. He is not certain whether he won or lost today.\"\n\nDiego de Daza steps forward, his practical mind working through different calculations.\n\n\"Your Majesty avoided bloodshed. That is not softness—that is wisdom. A civil war in Castile, now, with the Ottoman campaign approaching? The cost would have been catastrophic. Not merely in lives, but in treasure, in time, in the alliances you have built.\"\n\nHe shakes his head.\n\n\"Luna's removal is a loss, yes. He was competent. But he was also a lightning rod. Every noble grievance, legitimate or invented, attached itself to him. With Luna gone, what do they rally against? A council they themselves demanded? The Cortes they themselves participate in?\"\n\nHe frowns slightly.\n\n\"The question of future demands is real. But consider: you have given them a mechanism for voice. The noble estate will have a seat on the regency council. If they have concerns, they now have a legitimate channel. Conspiracy thrives in silence. You have given them speech.\"\n\nDon Alonso Pérez de Vivero hesitates longest before speaking. When he does, his voice is careful.\n\n\"Your Majesty asks if you were too soft. May I speak frankly?\"\n\nHe waits for your nod before continuing.\n\n\"The nobles came to you with a petition signed by seven houses. Seven of the greatest names in Castile, united against one man. They did not come with armies. They did not come with demands for your abdication. They came with words, through process, asking for a hearing.\"\n\nHe spreads his hands.\n\n\"This is what the Cortes is for. This is what your reforms have built. Twenty years ago, such grievances would have meant war. Today, they meant a petition and a negotiation. That is not weakness, Your Majesty. That is the system working as intended.\"\n\nA pause.\n\n\"Will they make demands next year? Perhaps. Lords always want more. But today they learned something important: their king listens. Their king negotiates. Their king gives ground where ground can be given—but shapes the outcome to his own design.\"\n\nHis voice drops slightly.\n\n\"Stúñiga is clever. He will study what happened today. And he will realize that he was outmaneuvered by a king who agreed with everything he said and gave him nothing he truly wanted. That is not a lesson that encourages future demands. That is a lesson that encourages caution.\"\n\nThe three men fall silent, their counsel offered.\n\nThe fire crackles. Outside, the sounds of the departing noble retinues fade into the evening.",

The language must be precise—clear enough to bind, flexible enough to preserve royal authority.\n\nAfter several revisions, the decree takes shape:\n\nOrdinatio Consilii Regentiae Castellae\n\nDecree Establishing the Regency Council of Castile\n\nIn the name of God Almighty, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Amen.\n\nJuan, by the Grace of God King of Castile, León, Aragon, Naples, and Sicily, Defender of the Faith and Protector of Christendom, to all who read this decree, greeting and grace.\n\nPreamble\n\nWhereas the burdens of our office require our presence in distant lands for the defense of Christendom;\n\nWhereas the governance of our realm of Castile must continue in our absence with wisdom and justice;\n\nWhereas the concentration of such governance in a single hand has proven neither prudent nor in keeping with the ancient customs of our realm;\n\nWe do hereby establish, by our royal authority and with the counsel of our faithful subjects, a Council of Regency for the governance of Castile during such times as we are absent from the realm.\n\nArticle I: Composition\n\nThe Council of Regency shall consist of three members, each representing one of the estates of the realm:\n\nFirstly, one member elected by the noble estate of the Cortes, from among their number;\n\nSecondly, one member elected by the estate of the commons of the Cortes, from among their number;\n\nThirdly, one member elected by the ecclesiastical estate of the Cortes, from among their number.\n\nEach estate shall determine its own representative by such method as that estate sees fit, provided that the selection is made during a lawfully assembled session of the Cortes.\n\nArticle II: Authority\n\nThe Council of Regency shall exercise the governance of Castile in the King's absence, with authority to:\n\nFirstly, maintain the peace and administer justice throughout the realm;\n\nSecondly, collect and disburse the ordinary revenues of the Crown according to established law and custom;\n\nThirdly, correspond with foreign powers on routine matters not touching upon war, alliance, or the succession;\n\nFourthly, make such appointments to minor offices as the administration of the realm requires;\n\nFifthly, execute such other duties as the proper governance of the realm demands.\n\nArticle III: Limitations\n\nThe Council of Regency shall NOT, without the express written consent of the King, undertake any of the following:\n\nFirstly, declare war or conclude peace with any foreign power;\n\nSecondly, negotiate treaties of alliance or marriage touching upon the royal house;\n\nThirdly, alter the laws or customs of the realm;\n\nFourthly, levy extraordinary taxation beyond that already approved by the Cortes;\n\nFifthly, make appointments to the great offices of state;\n\nSixthly, alienate any lands, castles, or revenues belonging to the Crown;\n\nSeventhly, pardon crimes of treason, heresy, or lèse-majesté.\n\nArticle IV: Obedience to the Crown\n\nThe Council of Regency serves at the pleasure of the King and Queen. Its members are bound to obey all commands issued by the King, or by the Queen acting in the King's name. No act of the Council may contradict a direct royal instruction. The King retains the authority to overrule, modify, or annul any decision of the Council at any time, for any reason, without explanation.\n\nThe Queen, when present in Castile, shall be kept informed of all significant matters before the Council and may attend its deliberations at her pleasure. Her counsel shall be sought on all matters touching upon the royal household, the succession, or the welfare of the royal children.\n\nArticle V: Term and Election\n\nEach member of the Council of Regency shall serve until the next lawful assembly of the Cortes, at which time all three positions shall be subject to election anew. No presumption of continuity shall attach to any member; each Cortes shall make its selections freely, whether to retain the current member or to select another.\n\nThe first election under this decree shall take place at the next assembly of the Cortes following the promulgation of this decree.\n\nArticle VI: Vacancy\n\nShould any member of the Council die, become incapacitated, or be removed by royal command during their term, the remaining members shall continue to exercise the Council's authority until the relevant estate can select a replacement. Such selection may be made by the assembled heads of that estate in Toledo, without requiring a full session of the Cortes, provided that at least seven members of the estate concur in the selection.\n\nArticle VII: Accountability\n\nThe Council of Regency shall maintain full and accurate records of all decisions, expenditures, and correspondence undertaken in the King's name. These records shall be made available to the King upon his return, or at any time upon royal request. Any member found to have acted contrary to royal instruction, to have exceeded the Council's authority, or to have enriched himself through his office, shall be subject to removal and such further punishment as the King sees fit.\n\nSeal and Promulgation\n\nGiven at Toledo, in the Month of November, Anno Domini 1439\n\nLet this decree be read in every cathedral, published in every market, and recorded in every archive of our realm, that none may claim ignorance of its provisions.\n\nJUAN II\n\nRex Castellae et Legionis, Aragonum, Neapolis et Siciliae\n\nDefensor Romaniae\n\nDiego de Daza reviews the final draft and nods.\n\n\"Clean, Your Majesty.
