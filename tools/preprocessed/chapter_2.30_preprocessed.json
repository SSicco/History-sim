My martial skills are improving, focusing on poleaxe and lance techniques. The potential meeting with Sultan Murad II remains a critical diplomatic opportunity, though its status is still uncertain.\n\nSeveral pending matters require attention: the Admiral's arrival from Aragon, integrating Demetrios Komnenos, reviewing Morocco mission outcomes, and coordinating foreign manufacturing experts. These elements will shape strategic developments in the coming months.\n\nNow I have the full picture. Let me provide a concise introduction.\n\nChapter 2.30 — Late Summer 1435\n\nToledo, Kingdom of Castile\n\nThe months since your return to Toledo have been consumed by the patient work of building. While Lucia tends the nursery—Fernando now walks with determined purpose, Catalina chatters endlessly to her new Italian aunts, and Bianca's first teeth have emerged—you have held councils, signed charters, and set in motion the machinery of economic transformation.\n\nThe kingdom's coffers remain healthy. Your treasury stands near 545,000 florins, with 200,000 reserved for the naval expansion that awaits only an admiral's direction. Diego de Daza's first year of infrastructure investment is underway: drove roads are being surveyed, bridges assessed, watering points catalogued by the Mesta and the goatherds alike.\n\nYour shadow capabilities are taking shape. Isaac de Baeza has established listening posts in Venice, Rome, and Naples. Demetrios Komnenos arrived from Venice some months past—a haunted man with watchful eyes who now shadows Lucia and the children with the silent focus of one who has finally found something worth protecting. Tomás de Cuenca serves as court physician, his other skills known only to you.\n\nThe manufacturing councils have met. The leather guild of Córdoba is expanding; Sevillian fishermen are learning their new vessels; Granada's silk looms multiply. The Junta de Manufacturas coordinates what was once disconnected.\n\nConstantinople thrives beyond all expectation. Reports indicate the settlement campaign has drawn thousands of Latin families eastward. The Military Orders establish their commanderies. Emperor John VIII has reason for cautious hope.\n\nSpring has passed. The meeting at Tenedos with Sultan Murad II—that fateful conversation you arranged through Hamza Bey—lies in the past now, its consequences still unfolding. The Admiral from Aragon, whom you requested from Alfonso V, should be arriving any day.\n\nThe Dominicans prepare their facilities in Granada. Fray Tomás de Torquemada awaits only the papal mandate to begin his work.\n\nThe late summer sun beats down on Toledo's stones. What matters do you wish to set in motion before the seasons turn?",

Moving operations to the East means... what exactly? Abandoning their Spanish holdings? Splitting their forces? He'll want to know what this means for their existing properties and incomes.\n- What won't he say? He probably won't openly say he's worried about losing influence in Castile, or that the Eastern mission feels like exile.\n- What has he seen? Granada conquered. The Orders' traditional purpose (Reconquista) complete. Juan's growing power. The 5,000 florins grant. The settlement campaign in Constantinople showing extraordinary success (roll of 99).\n\n**Don García López de Padilla (Master of Calatrava):**\n- What does he want? Calatrava controls the Almadén mercury mines. They have significant holdings. Similar concerns to Santiago.\n- What won't he say? Similar reservations.\n- What has he seen? He worked closely with Juan during Granada, so he knows Juan's style. He's reliable.\n\n**Don Fernando de Solís (Commander representing Alcántara):**\n- What does he want? He's in an awkward position - his Master is already in Constantinople. He probably wants to know what resources he's supposed to send, and whether the Order's Castilian holdings will be maintained.\n- What won't he say? He can't make major commitments without his Master's approval.\n- What has he seen? His Order is already most committed to the Eastern mission.\n\nNow, regarding the 300 soldiers - I need to check what was actually ordered. Let me think about what I found in the project files...\n\nThe military expansion is significant. Juan has increased troop presence to 1,000 soldiers, with 300 additional troops joining the existing force. The settlement campaign has been remarkably successful, suggesting a strategic vision for establishing a strong Castilian presence in Constantinople. The masters will be weighing the potential benefits against the risks of committing resources to this eastern venture.\n\nTheir key concerns range from practical governance challenges to financial implications. They'll seek clarity on security responsibilities, territorial management, and the potential impact on existing Spanish territories. The interaction with the Byzantine government will be a critical point of discussion, as will the funding mechanism for this ambitious resettlement and military deployment strategy.\n\nThe three men exchange glances. Don Rodrigo's weathered face remains composed, but you can see the calculation behind his eyes. Don García nods slowly, as if he expected something of this nature. Don Fernando de Solís shifts slightly—he is the one in the most awkward position, representing an Order whose Master already stands on Constantinople's walls.\n\nDon García speaks first to the practical matter: \"The three hundred reinforcements sailed from Valencia in April, Your Majesty, with Aragonese transport ships King Alfonso provided. They should have reached Constantinople by midsummer. We have had no report of disaster, so we must assume they arrived safely.\" He pauses. \"We await word from Master Sotomayor, but communications from the East are... slow.\"\n\nDon Rodrigo clears his throat and addresses the larger question. His tone is respectful but measured.\n\n\"Your Majesty speaks of populating Constantinople as we populated the lands taken from the Moors. Santiago remembers well how this was done—we were granted territories, we brought settlers, we built commanderies and churches, we made wilderness into Christendom.\" He folds his hands. \"But Constantinople is not an empty frontier. It is an ancient city with an Emperor, a Patriarch, laws and customs a thousand years old. The Greeks...\"\n\nHe chooses his words carefully.\n\n\"The Greeks have their own way of things. What role does Your Majesty envision for the Orders in this... new Reconquista? Are we to hold lands granted by Emperor John? Recruit Castilian families to settle in Byzantine territory? Defend walls that Greek soldiers have defended for centuries?\"\n\nDon Fernando speaks up, perhaps emboldened by the fact that his Order is already committed: \"Master Sotomayor writes that the settlement proclamation has drawn great interest. Families are coming. But he notes that quarters are cramped, that the Greeks watch the Latins with... wariness. A thousand of our men already strain the city's patience. What numbers does Your Majesty contemplate?\"",

If only a small amount want to migrate to the new fronties, we will outnumber the greeks. This is not a goal on itself, I do not seek to dominate the Greeks, but we will be able to bring our own culture and not be a minority. The city is growing rapidly and the announcements are well-recieved. I want to send even more men there. Surely the knights of Santiago are suited to exactly this purpose no?

Millions of Christians in Castile - even small migration would outnumber Greeks\n4. He doesn't seek to dominate Greeks, just establish a Latin presence\n5. The settlement campaign is working well\n6. He can grant decrees as both Defensor Romaniae and King of Castile\n7. Santiago's purpose is exactly this kind of frontier work\n\nThe Masters need to respond realistically. What are their concerns?\n\nDon Rodrigo of Santiago specifically:\n- Santiago is the largest, wealthiest order\n- Their holdings are in Castile and Portugal\n- They've just seen Granada conquered - their traditional purpose fulfilled\n- Moving east means abandoning comfortable Spanish holdings for uncertain Eastern adventure\n- But Juan has a point - this IS what they were founded for\n\nWhat would realistic concerns be?\n1. Logistics - how do we transport settlers?\n2. Finances - who pays for this?\n3. Governance - what lands/rights will the Orders receive?\n4. Purpose - are we defending, settling, or both?\n5. Ottoman threat - we're putting our men in the path of the Turk\n6. Competition with Greeks - will this cause friction?\n7. Their own institutional interests - do they give up Spanish holdings?\n\nDon Rodrigo wouldn't be hostile - Juan has won the Granada crusade, he's clearly blessed by God and successful. But he would want to understand the practical arrangements. This is a negotiation about terms, not about whether to obey the King.\n\nLet me have them respond thoughtfully, acknowledging Juan's points while pressing for practical details. They're not refusing - they're trying to understand what this means for their Orders.\n\nDon Rodrigo inclines his head, acknowledging your points. The defensive note in his earlier words softens—you have answered his concerns directly, and he is too experienced a man to argue against facts.\n\n\"Your Majesty speaks truly. I had not considered the scale of the emptiness.\" He strokes his beard thoughtfully. \"A city built for half a million, holding forty thousand. There is room for a kingdom within those walls.\"\n\nDon García leans forward, his administrator's mind already working. \"The settlement proclamation—I have read the terms. Generous. Land grants, tax relief, protection under Latin law while respecting Greek customs. If this is being well-received, as Your Majesty says, then the Orders could serve as... anchors. Commanderies that settlers cluster around, as they did in Extremadura and La Mancha.\"\n\nDon Fernando nods cautiously. \"Master Sotomayor's letters speak of the walls, the watches, the drills with Greek soldiers. But he has said little of settlement work. If Your Majesty wishes the Orders to take on this second role—not merely defending Constantinople but populating it—then we must discuss practical matters.\"\n\nDon Rodrigo raises a hand, ticking off fingers: \"First, transport. Moving a thousand knights is one thing. Moving families—wives, children, livestock, tools, seed grain—requires ships we do not have. Second, land grants. Your Majesty holds authority as Defensor, but what territories can you promise? Inside the walls? The Thracian hinterland? Third...\"\n\nHe pauses, meeting your eyes directly.\n\n\"Third, the Turk. We are not fools, Your Majesty. We know why you reinforce those walls. Settlers will ask: are we going to a new home, or to a siege? What do we tell them?\"",

      "text": "Juan is making a passionate pitch to the Military Order masters about expanding settlement in Constantinople. He's addressing their concerns about transport, housing, and the Ottoman threat. Let me think about how these men would realistically respond.\n\nDon Rodrigo Manrique is the senior master - Santiago is the largest and wealthiest order. He's a practical man who has seen many campaigns. He'll be weighing the costs and benefits to his Order.\n\nDon García López de Padilla of Calatrava is the administrator type - he organized the Te Deum, he's steady and competent. He'll be thinking about logistics.\n\nDon Fernando de Solís is representing Alcántara in Sotomayor's absence - he's in an awkward position because his Order is already committed to Constantinople.\n\nJuan's pitch is compelling but the Masters will have concerns:\n1. This is a major commitment of resources and men\n2. The Orders derive their wealth and power from their Spanish lands - moving resources east means less influence at home\n3. The Ottoman threat is real - Juan's confidence is inspiring but they know wars are uncertain\n4. What's in it for the Orders specifically? New lands, new purpose, yes, but also new risks\n\nThey should acknowledge Juan's points while pressing for specifics about what he actually wants from them - numbers, timelines, what territories, what authority the Orders would have.\n\nThey shouldn't be hostile - Juan has been generous and successful. But they should be cautious businessmen protecting their Orders' interests. Low rolls don't apply here since there's no roll - this is just a conversation about logistics and commitment.\n\nLet me write their response - they should be warming to the idea but still seeking concrete details about what Juan actually wants from them.\n\nThe invocation of faith lands differently with each man. Don Fernando crosses himself reflexively—his Order already stands on those walls, and the reminder that their work is holy service visibly steadies him. Don García nods with the pragmatic acceptance of a man who has heard many such speeches but recognizes when one is backed by genuine conviction and resources.\n\nDon Rodrigo studies you for a long moment. Whatever skepticism he carried into this chamber is fading. You have answered his practical objections and offered something his Order has lacked since Granada fell: purpose.\n\n\"Santiago was founded to fight the Moor,\" he says slowly. \"For three centuries, that was our reason for being. When Granada fell, men asked—what now? Guard empty frontiers? Grow fat on our estates?\" He shakes his head. \"Your Majesty offers us a new enemy, a new frontier, a new purpose. This is... not unwelcome.\"\n\nDon García speaks up: \"Calatrava holds lands in La Mancha that have been peaceful for a generation. Our younger knights grow restless. The chance to build something—commanderies in the East, a new chapter of our Order's history—this would draw volunteers, not conscripts.\"\n\nDon Fernando adds quietly: \"Master Sotomayor already speaks of Alcántara's future being written on Byzantine stone rather than Portuguese borders.\"\n\nDon Rodrigo leans forward, his tone shifting from philosophical to practical.\n\n\"Very well, Your Majesty. You have transport, you have housing, you have faith. Tell us what you want. How many knights from each Order? How many settler families do you wish us to recruit from our lands? What timeline? And—\" he glances at his peers, \"—what authority will the Orders hold in Constantinople? Will we answer to Master Sotomayor? To Emperor John? To Your Majesty directly?\"",

Recruit from their own territories (peasants, craftsmen, minor nobility)\n2. Use their networks and reputation to attract volunteers from outside their lands\n3. Organize the logistics of gathering people, their possessions, etc.\n\nBut there are limiting factors beyond just ships:\n- Willingness of people to uproot their lives\n- The Orders' administrative capacity\n- The need to not depopulate their own lands too much\n- Seasonal considerations (harvests, etc.)\n- The time needed to organize such movements\n\nLet me have the Masters give a realistic assessment. They should be thoughtful about this - they know their lands and people.\n\nDon Rodrigo of Santiago would have the largest capacity as the wealthiest Order.\nDon García of Calatrava would give a measured, administrative response.\nDon Fernando would speak more tentatively since he's not the Master.\n\nI should have them discuss practical realities:\n- How many families per year could realistically be organized?\n- What kinds of people would be willing to go?\n- What would motivate settlers?\n\nThey shouldn't just give a single number - this is a complex question that requires discussion. And they should be realistic, not just agreeable. Moving thousands of families is a massive undertaking.\n\nThe three men fall silent for a moment. This is not a question any of them has considered in such terms before. Don Rodrigo turns to Don García, who has the most administrative experience among them.\n\nDon García pulls at his chin, calculating. \"Your Majesty asks us to think without limits, but there are limits beyond ships. Willingness. Organization. The harvest cycle—no peasant family will leave between planting and reaping.\"\n\nHe begins thinking aloud: \"Santiago, Calatrava, and Alcántara together hold perhaps... six hundred towns and villages across Castile, León, and Extremadura. Some prosperous, some poor. The poor are more willing to move—they have less to lose. A young second son with no inheritance, a widow with children, a craftsman whose guild has no room for him...\"\n\nDon Rodrigo picks up the thread: \"From Santiago's lands alone, if we preached this as a crusade—land, housing, purpose, salvation—we might find five hundred families in a good year who would take the Cross and go East. Perhaps more if the terms are generous and the reports from early settlers are favorable.\"\n\n\"Calatrava, perhaps three hundred,\" Don García adds. \"Our territories are smaller.\"\n\nDon Fernando speaks carefully: \"Alcántara is the smallest of the three. Two hundred families, perhaps. But Master Sotomayor's presence in Constantinople itself is an advantage—letters home from knights already there carry weight.\"\n\nDon Rodrigo summarizes: \"A thousand families per year, perhaps. More if Your Majesty extends recruitment beyond Order lands to all of Castile. Fewer if the news from the East turns sour.\" He pauses. \"That is four or five thousand souls annually. To reach five hundred thousand...\"\n\nHe leaves the arithmetic unspoken.",

Don García is the administrator. Don Fernando needs to communicate with Sotomayor.\n\nI should have them accept the task, ask practical clarifying questions, and set things in motion. This is a \"yes, and here's what we need to do it\" response rather than resistance - the player has addressed their concerns and this is genuinely a good opportunity for the Orders.\n\nDon Rodrigo nods slowly, and you can see something shift in his bearing—the wariness of a subordinate being given orders transforming into the energy of a commander given a mission.\n\n\"It will be done, Your Majesty. We will send riders to every commandery, every town under our jurisdiction. The message will be clear: land, housing, and holy purpose in the East. Those willing to take the Cross and settle, make yourselves known.\"\n\nDon García is already thinking through the logistics. \"We should use a common standard for the count—heads of household, with numbers of family members, their trades if they have them.

They're warriors and administrators of land, not sailors. Even with money and motivation, building a fleet from nothing is a multi-year undertaking that requires expertise they don't have.\n\nI should create a table that reflects this reality - probably weighted toward modest or limited progress, with the possibility of either surprising success (if they hired good people) or near-failure (if they didn't prioritize it or didn't know how to begin).\n\nLet me draft:\n\n1-10: Virtually Nothing\nThe Orders focused entirely on the Constantinople garrison. Ports remain undeveloped, no ships constructed. Perhaps some preliminary surveys or plans, but no actual progress.\n \nThe Orders are making tentative steps into naval development, but their progress is painfully slow. They've managed to acquire a few small vessels through purchase, likely relying on existing maritime traders or neighboring kingdoms. The ports remain largely untouched, with minimal infrastructure improvements. Their lack of naval expertise is evident - they're essentially waiting for guidance, unsure how to proceed with their maritime responsibilities. The shipbuilding process hasn't truly begun, reflecting their traditional land-based military background.\n\nAt this stage, they've barely scratched the surface of naval capability. One Order might have shown slightly more initiative, perhaps hiring a local shipwright or beginning preliminary discussions about vessel construction. However, the overall effort remains minimal, demonstrating their significant learning curve in maritime endeavors.\n\nThe development is characterized by uncertainty and hesitation. They understand the strategic importance of naval power but lack the practical knowledge to transform their mandate into actual maritime strength. Their approach is more reactive than proactive, waiting for clear direction or external expertise to guide their naval transformation. They've built a credible naval capability, starting from minimal maritime experience. The progression shows strategic investment and gradual skill development, with realistic potential for naval growth balanced against inherent challenges.\n\nDon Rodrigo exchanges a glance with Don García. The question touches on something they have clearly discussed amongst themselves—and perhaps worried over.\n\n\"Your Majesty granted us Almería, Almuñécar, and Adra,\" Don García says carefully. \"We have... begun.\"\n\nThe hesitation in his voice suggests the answer may not be entirely satisfactory. Let me consider the factors:\n\nSUCCESS FACTORS:\n\n5,000 florins granted to each Order for their Eastern mission\n\nPorts in Granada awarded to develop naval capacity\n\nStrong motivation—their new purpose requires sea transport\n\nNearly two years since Granada fell (late 1432)\n\nOrders have wealth from extensive landholdings\n\nOrganizational capacity proven in the crusade\n\nFAILURE FACTORS:\n\nMilitary Orders are land forces—cavalry, fortresses, infantry\n\nNo naval tradition, expertise, or experienced sailors\n\nShipbuilding requires specialized craftsmen they don't possess\n\nGranada's ports need repair after conquest and years of decline\n\nCastile itself lacks naval capacity (hence requesting Aragonese admiral)\n\nPrimary focus has been Constantinople garrison, not shipbuilding\n\nTwo years is short for building naval tradition from nothing\n\nD100 — MILITARY ORDERS' NAVAL DEVELOPMENT\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-15\nVirtually Nothing — Ports surveyed, plans discussed, but no ships built. Orders focused entirely on Constantinople garrison.\n16-30\nMinimal Progress — A few small vessels purchased, not built. Ports barely touched. Orders uncertain how to proceed without expertise.\n31-45\nSlow Start — One Order hired a shipwright; 2-3 small vessels under construction. Others lag. Basic port repairs only.\n46-60\nReasonable Foundation — Each Order has 1-2 small vessels operational or building. One port functioning. Expertise being sought.\n61-75\nSolid Progress — 6-10 vessels total across Orders. Foreign shipwrights hired. One port developed as proper base.\n76-88\nImpressive Development — 12-15 vessels including some larger ships. Two ports active. Aragonese or Genoese experts engaged.\n89-100\nExceptional Success — 18+ vessels, experienced captains recruited, all three ports under development. A genuine fleet emerging.\n\nShall I roll?",

Considering maritime challenges like weather, repairs, and loading times, ships might manage 2-3 round trips during the sailing season. This translates to approximately 3000-4500 settlers annually, which closely matches the target of 1000 families or 4000-5000 individuals.\n\nI'll need the Masters to verify these logistical calculations and confirm our recruitment projections.\n\nDon García furrows his brow, and you can see him working through the arithmetic. He is the most administratively minded of the three, and this is precisely the sort of calculation he excels at.\n\n\"Galleys are warships, Your Majesty. They can carry soldiers packed tight for short voyages, but families with children, tools, seed grain, perhaps a goat or two...\" He shakes his head. \"A forty-oar galley might carry thirty settlers in decent comfort. Fifty if we press them.\"\n\nDon Rodrigo adds: \"Our nao and transport vessel are better suited. The nao could carry one hundred twenty souls, perhaps more. The transport, another hundred.\"\n\nDon García begins counting on his fingers: \"Our six galleys—call it two hundred forty settlers at most. The nao and transport, another two hundred twenty. By spring, perhaps one more galley. Say five hundred souls per voyage from the Orders' ships alone.\"\n\nHe looks up. \"Your Majesty's carracks are another matter. A carrack of two hundred tons might carry two hundred fifty settlers with their goods. Three hundred if we sacrifice comfort. Four carracks—a thousand souls, perhaps more.\"\n\nDon Rodrigo nods slowly. \"The royal galleys add another two hundred.\"\n\n\"One voyage, then,\" Don García summarizes, \"could carry seventeen hundred settlers. Perhaps as many as two thousand if conditions are favorable and we pack tightly.\"\n\nHe pauses. \"But the journey to Constantinople is long, Your Majesty. Six weeks with good winds. Loading, unloading, repairs, weather... Two voyages per sailing season is realistic. Three if God favors us.\"\n\n\"So perhaps four thousand settlers in a year,\" Don Rodrigo concludes. \"Assuming we find them, and assuming nothing goes wrong.\"",

These same ships can carry soldiers in wartime, though not comfortably.\"\n\n\"Second: War. The Ottoman fleet is galleys—fast, maneuverable, rowed by slaves or soldiers. To fight them, you need galleys of your own. But galleys are hungry beasts. They need ports, supplies, fresh water constantly. They cannot cross oceans.\"\n\n\"Third: Trade and fishing. Your fishermen want vessels for the Atlantic. Sturdy, seaworthy, able to weather storms and carry salt cod home. These are different from Mediterranean ships—deeper hulls, different rigging.\"\n\n\"Fourth: Patrol and escort. Smaller, faster vessels to protect merchants, hunt pirates, carry messages.\"\n\nHe looks up. \"Your Majesty, shall I prepare a formal assessment?

      "text": "Vilaragut is an experienced Mediterranean naval officer from the 1430s. At this time:\n- Galleys dominated Mediterranean warfare\n- Carracks were primarily cargo vessels, though they could carry some guns\n- Naval gunnery was still primitive - guns were small, inaccurate, and couldn't sink ships reliably\n- The transition to gun-armed sailing ships defeating galleys wouldn't really happen until Lepanto (1571) and even then galleys remained important\n\nSo Vilaragut would have opinions on this. He would:\n1. Be skeptical of the idea that carracks with guns can replace galleys in battle\n2. Know that carracks are slow, dependent on wind, and can be surrounded by galleys in calm waters\n3. Recognize that guns are useful but not yet decisive in naval warfare\n4. Understand that the Mediterranean is different from the Atlantic\n\nBut he would also:\n1. Recognize that Juan has a point about supply lines - Castile is far from the Eastern Mediterranean\n2. Agree that allies (Venice, Genoa, Aragon, the Military Orders) can supply galleys closer to the action\n3. See the logic in focusing on what Castile does well - Atlantic shipbuilding\n\nThis is a forward-thinking idea from Juan that is ahead of its time, but not completely unreasonable. Vilaragut should give an honest professional assessment - skeptical but open to the logic of the strategic situation.\n\nVilaragut's brow furrows. You have touched on something that clearly runs against his instincts—but he does not dismiss it outright. He is thinking.\n\n\"Your Majesty proposes something... unconventional.\" He chooses his words carefully. \"In the Mediterranean, galleys rule. They do not depend on wind. They can maneuver in battle, retreat, pursue, hold formation. A carrack becalmed is a floating fortress that cannot move—galleys will circle it, board it, take it.\"\n\nHe holds up a hand before you can respond.\n\n\"But—Your Majesty is not wrong to think this way. Guns are changing war at sea, slowly. A carrack with bombards can shatter a galley's hull before the rowers close the distance. I have seen it. The Venetians experiment with this. The problem is...\" He pauses, searching for the right way to explain.\n\n\"Guns are slow to reload. Inaccurate. They work in defense—a carrack holding position, firing at galleys that approach. They work less well in attack. You cannot chase down a galley with a carrack. You cannot blockade a port if the enemy simply rows out on a calm day and swarms you.\"\n\nHe scratches his chin thoughtfully.\n\n\"Your Majesty's strategic logic, though—this I understand. Castile is far from Constantinople. Galleys cannot sail the Atlantic; they must creep along coasts, port to port. Carracks can cross oceans. If your allies—Aragon, Venice, the Military Orders, perhaps the Greeks themselves—provide galleys for close battle, and Castile provides the great ships that carry men, supplies, and heavy guns...\"\n\nHe trails off, reconsidering.\n\n\"It could work. A division of purpose. Castile builds what Castile builds well—Atlantic ships, large and sturdy, armed with the heaviest guns we can mount. We leave the galley work to those with ports in the East.\"\n\nHe looks at you with new interest. \"Has Your Majesty discussed this with King Alfonso? His galleys and your carracks together would be... formidable.\"",

I should roll for how well the assessment goes and what his findings are.\n\nLet me draft a d100 table for the quality/comprehensiveness of his assessment and plan.\n\nActually, this is more of a straightforward administrative task for a competent professional. He's not trying to persuade anyone or deal with chaos - he's just doing his job. I think this should be resolved narratively with maybe a roll for any unexpected discoveries or complications.\n\nLet me think about what a reasonable assessment would look like:\n\nCurrent assets:\n- 4 royal carracks\n- 5 royal galleys\n- Military Orders have ~8-10 small vessels (galleys and 1-2 transport ships)\n\nNeeds identified:\n- Large transport capacity for Constantinople settlers (thousands per year)\n- Atlantic fishing fleet (already requested by fishermen)\n- Patrol/anti-piracy for southern coasts\n- Heavy gun-armed carracks for potential conflict with Ottomans\n\nInfrastructure needs:\n- Royal shipyard at Seville\n- Training facilities/naval academy\n- Timber supply contracts\n- Recruitment of skilled shipwrights\n\nI'll create a brief d100 table for the assessment quality and any unexpected findings, then narrate the results.\n\nActually, let me just narrate this well with a simple roll for how good his plan is / any complications or discoveries.\n\nThree Months Later — Early January 1435\n\nThe weeks pass. Vilaragut throws himself into his task with the methodical energy of a man given meaningful work after years of routine. He meets your carrack captains—gruff Basques who eye the Catalan with suspicion until he demonstrates he knows a backstay from a bowline. He sails to Seville and spends days walking the riverbanks, measuring depths, questioning local pilots about currents and silting. He rides north to the Basque shipyards of Bilbao and Santander, watching craftsmen work, haggling with timber merchants, taking notes in a cramped hand.\n\nDiego de Daza assigns him a sharp young administrator named Alonso de Córdoba, who knows nothing of ships but everything of contracts, ledgers, and the particular corruptions of Castilian commerce. The two men become an unlikely pair—the weathered sailor and the precise clerk—but they work well together.\n\nRoll for Assessment Quality: 1d100\n\nThis determines how thorough, insightful, and actionable Vilaragut's plan is.\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-15\nFlawed — Significant gaps or errors. Will need revision.\n16-35\nAdequate — Competent but unimaginative. A workable starting point.\n36-55\nSolid — Professional work. Clear priorities, realistic timelines.\n56-75\nExcellent — Thorough and insightful. Identifies opportunities others would miss.\n76-90\nExceptional — A masterwork of planning. Vilaragut exceeds expectations.\n91-100\nVisionary — The assessment itself becomes a landmark document for naval development.\n\nShall I roll?",

The plan needs work, and someone (probably Juan or his advisors) will need to identify the problems and send Vilaragut back to fix them.\n\nToledo, Early January 1435\n\nVilaragut presents his findings in the council chamber. He has prepared documents, sketches of proposed shipyard layouts, tables of costs and timelines. Alonso de Córdoba stands beside him with ledgers.\n\nBut as the admiral speaks, you notice Álvaro de Luna's expression tightening. Diego de Daza begins flipping through the cost estimates with increasing frequency. Something is wrong.\n\nVilaragut proposes a massive shipyard complex at Seville—ambitious, sprawling, capable of building twenty vessels simultaneously. His timeline suggests the first new carracks could launch within eighteen months. His cost estimates for timber seem remarkably low.\n\nWhen he finishes, there is silence.\n\nDiego de Daza speaks first, carefully. \"Don Berenguer... these timber prices. They are based on what the Basque merchants quoted you?\"\n\n\"Yes. They assured me—\"\n\n\"They lied.\" Diego's voice is flat. \"These are prices from five years ago, before the Granada campaign consumed half the timber in northern Castile. Current prices are nearly double this.\"\n\nVilaragut pales slightly.\n\nÁlvaro de Luna adds, gently but firmly: \"And this shipyard design—it assumes land that is currently occupied by the Atarazanas, the old Moorish arsenal. That land is tangled in disputes between the city, the Church, and three noble families. Acquiring it could take years of litigation.\"\n\nAlonso de Córdoba looks mortified. He should have caught these things.\n\nVilaragut stands rigid, absorbing the criticism. To his credit, he does not make excuses. \"I was deceived on the timber. And I did not investigate the land rights thoroughly. These are my failures.\"\n\nHe looks at you directly. \"Your Majesty, I can revise this.

We will get true prices in writing, with penalties for failure to deliver.\"\n\n\"Second: The Atarazanas land is a pit of vipers.

Don Berenguer should survey it.\"\n\n\"Third:\" He glances at Alonso de Córdoba, who looks miserable. \"Young Alonso is clever but inexperienced.

      "text": "Vilaragut would realistically suggest a combination of these. The most impactful would be purchasing existing ships and contracting foreign yards, since these bypass the shipyard construction delay entirely.\n\nLet me write his response offering these options with realistic costs and tradeoffs.\n\nVilaragut exchanges a glance with Rodrigo, who nods slightly. They have clearly discussed this.\n\n\"Several things, Your Majesty. None of them cheap.\"\n\nOPTION ONE: Purchase Existing Vessels\n\n\"We do not have to build every ship. We can buy them.\"\n\nVilaragut spreads his hands. \"Genoa, Venice, Portugal—they all have ships for sale. Merchants who have fallen on hard times, vessels seized for debts, older carracks still seaworthy but replaced by newer construction. Even Aragon might sell us surplus tonnage, given your alliance with King Alfonso.\"\n\nVessel Type\nAvailable\nEst.

So will the Portuguese. We commission new vessels from their yards while La Cartuja is under construction.\"\n\nYard\nVessel Types\nCapacity\nCost Premium\nGenoa\nCarracks, naos\n2-4/year\n+30-40% over domestic\nLisbon\nAtlantic vessels, naos\n3-5/year\n+20-25% over domestic\nBarcelona\nCarracks, galleys\n2-3/year\n+15-20% (allied rates)\n\n\"Barcelona offers the best terms—King Alfonso's shipwrights know we are allies. I could negotiate contracts for four to six new carracks over three years. They would cost perhaps 4,000 florins each instead of 3,000, but they would be ready while our own yards are still being built.\"\n\nProjected Cost: 16,000-24,000 florins for 4-6 carracks delivered over 3 years\n\nAdvantage: New construction, good quality, arrives while La Cartuja is built\nDisadvantage: Money leaves Castile, builds foreign capacity not our own\n\nOPTION THREE: Build Two Shipyards Simultaneously\n\nRodrigo de Salamanca speaks here, his tone cautious.\n\n\"The Atarazanas litigation could be... resolved, Your Majesty. With sufficient pressure. Or sufficient gold.\"\n\nHe lets that hang in the air.\n\n\"If the Crown offered the claimants fair compensation—perhaps 8,000-10,000 florins total—they might abandon their suits. The Church's portion could be addressed through an appeal to the Archbishop, who owes Your Majesty much. Then we would have two yards: La Cartuja for new construction, the Atarazanas for repairs, refitting, and smaller vessels.\"\n\nItem\nCost (Florins)\nSettlement of claims\n8,000-10,000\nAtarazanas repairs\n4,000-6,000\nTOTAL\n12,000-16,000\n\nAdvantage: Double capacity once operational, better strategic position\nDisadvantage: Still takes time to become operational, political complications\n\nOPTION FOUR: Aggressive Workforce Recruitment\n\nVilaragut taps the table. \"I said we need 150-200 workers. But if we paid double the usual wages, we could strip half the shipwrights from Valencia and Barcelona within a year. Men follow gold. Their families follow them.\"\n\nRecruitment Level\nWorkers\nSigning Cost\nAnnual Wages\nNormal\n150-200\n2,500-3,500\n6,000-8,000\nAggressive\n300-400\n8,000-12,000\n15,000-20,000\n\n\"With double the workforce, La Cartuja could be built in twelve months instead of twenty-four. And once operational, we could run two shifts—eight vessels per year instead of four to six.\"\n\nAdvantage: Dramatically faster construction\nDisadvantage: Very expensive, may anger allied kingdoms whose workers we poach\n\nCOMBINED ACCELERATION PLAN\n\nVilaragut straightens. \"If Your Majesty wishes to have a true fleet in five years instead of ten, here is what I would recommend:\"\n\nAction\nCost (Florins)\nResult\nPurchase 8-10 used vessels immediately\n15,000-20,000\nFleet operational within months\nContract Barcelona for 4-6 new carracks\n16,000-24,000\nNew ships arriving years 2-4\nAggressive workforce recruitment\n8,000-12,000\nLa Cartuja operational in 12-18 months\nSettle Atarazanas claims\n12,000-16,000\nSecond yard for repairs/small craft\nTOTAL ACCELERATION COST\n51,000-72,000\n\n\"Added to the base plan of 26,000-33,000 for Year One, Your Majesty would spend perhaps 80,000-100,000 florins in the first year alone.\"\n\nHe meets your eyes. \"But you would have a growing fleet immediately, two operational shipyards within eighteen months, and the capacity to build eight to ten vessels annually thereafter. By 1440, Castile would rival Aragon at sea.\"\n\nRodrigo adds quietly: \"The treasury can bear it, Your Majesty. The question is whether this is where you wish to spend it.\"",

I'll map out Year 1's naval expansion strategically. The fleet will grow through immediate purchases, Basque contracts, and initial shipyard developments. Key focus: rapidly increasing naval assets while establishing infrastructure for sustained growth.\n\nYear 1 will see significant fleet augmentation, with purchases complementing emerging shipbuilding capabilities. The goal is building a robust maritime foundation for future expansion.\n\nYear 2 introduces operational shipyards, accelerating vessel production. La Cartuja's initial half-year output and continued Basque contracts will drive fleet diversification. By year's end, the fleet composition will demonstrate substantial growth across multiple vessel types.\n\nYear 3 represents full shipyard maturation, with La Cartuja producing 6-8 vessels and Basque contracts maintaining momentum. The fleet's diversity and size will continue expanding systematically.\n\nMilitary Orders maintain a separate fleet track, currently possessing 8 vessels across different types.\n\nSettler and military transport capacities reveal nuanced vessel capabilities. Carracks emerge as primary settler and troop transport vessels, with significant annual movement potential. Each vessel type offers distinct transportation capabilities, ranging from comfortable settler relocation to emergency military deployment.\n\nThe emerging strategy prioritizes fleet diversification, production scalability, and multi-purpose vessel utility across settler colonization and potential military requirements.\n\nROYAL NAVAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN — REVISED\nPrepared by Don Berenguer de

You will be able to move twenty thousand settlers annually to Constantinople in comfort, or land twenty-four thousand soldiers in a single emergency lift.\"\n\nHe pauses. \"Combined with allied fleets—Aragon, Venice, the Orders, perhaps Rhodes—you could project forty thousand men or more to the Eastern Mediterranean.\"\n\nRodrigo de Salamanca adds: \"The cost is substantial. Perhaps 250,000-300,000 florins over six years, including vessel construction and operating costs. But it is within the kingdom's means—particularly if Constantinople trade begins generating returns.\"\n\nVilaragut concludes: \"Your Majesty asked for the largest and best fleet in the world. This plan does not achieve that—Venice and Genoa will still surpass us in total tonnage. But it achieves something perhaps more valuable: a fleet built for your purposes. Transport, projection, and the defense of Christendom in the East.\"\n\n\"Does this meet Your Majesty's requirements?\"",

He would think about the strategic implications, the political dimensions, and whether this serves the crown's interests.\n\nDiego de Daza is the Chief Financial Administrator - methodical, detail-oriented, focused on the numbers and practical implementation.\n\nLet me think about what each would say:\n\nÁlvaro would likely:\n- Approve of the strategic vision\n- Consider the political implications (building Castilian power, relationship with Aragon)\n- Think about what this means for Juan's broader ambitions\n- Perhaps raise concerns about dependency or risks\n\nDiego would likely:\n- Focus on the financial aspects\n- Confirm whether the treasury can bear these costs\n- Perhaps suggest adjustments or cautions about cash flow\n- Be practical and methodical in his assessment\n\nNeither should be sycophantic - they should offer genuine counsel, perhaps with some reservations or suggestions for improvement. They are intelligent advisors who pursue their own sense of what's best for the kingdom.\n\nÁlvaro de Luna has been listening intently, his fingers steepled beneath his chin. Diego de Daza has been making notes in the margins of his own ledger throughout Vilaragut's presentation.\n\nÁlvaro speaks first.\n\n\"The strategic logic is sound, Your Majesty. Don Berenguer has grasped what many admirals never understand—that a fleet must serve a purpose, not merely exist for its own glory.\" He nods toward the Catalan. \"The focus on transport capacity rather than pure warships is wise. We are not Genoa or Venice, fighting for trade routes. We are building an empire that must be fed—with settlers, with soldiers, with grain and iron and faith.\"\n\nHe rises and walks to the window, looking out over Toledo's rooftops.\n\n\"My concern is not the plan itself. It is the timing. Six years is a long time, Your Majesty. Much can change. The Sultan may not wait for us to build our fleet before he moves against Constantinople. France may not wait for us to secure Naples before pressing René of Anjou's claims.\" He turns back. \"We must ensure that the intermediate steps—each year's growth—provide meaningful capability, not merely promise of future strength.\"\n\nHe glances at the tables. \"By the end of 1435, we can move six thousand settlers or nearly eight thousand soldiers. That is real. That matters. But it also means that for the next two years, we remain vulnerable. If the Turk strikes before 1437...\"\n\nHe leaves the thought unfinished.\n\nDiego de Daza looks up from his notes, his expression careful.\n\n\"The treasury can bear this, Your Majesty. The numbers are large but not ruinous.\" He flips through pages. \"We ended 1434 with 545,000 florins, of which 200,000 was reserved for precisely this purpose. The first year cost of 68,500 florins is well within that reserve. Even accounting for the 40,000 annual infrastructure commitment and other obligations, we have margin.\"\n\nHe pauses, tapping his quill against the ledger.\n\n\"However. Don Berenguer projects annual naval costs rising to 60,000-70,000 florins by 1440. Added to infrastructure, the Military Orders' grants, the Constantinople commitments, the intelligence network, the Inquisition preparations...\" He calculates silently. \"Your Majesty's annual commitments are growing faster than revenue. The reforms I have implemented add perhaps 30,000 florins yearly. Mediterranean trade may add more—but may is not will.\"\n\nHe meets your eyes directly. \"We are not in danger today. But if Your Majesty continues to expand commitments at this pace, we will need new revenue sources within three to four years, or we will begin consuming the treasury's reserves rather than growing them.\"\n\nHe sets down his quill. \"I recommend we revisit the budget annually as the fleet grows. And I would urge Your Majesty to consider which commitments are essential and which might be delayed if revenues disappoint.\"\n\nÁlvaro adds quietly: \"There is also the matter of crew. Don Berenguer speaks of ships, but ships require sailors. Thousands of them, eventually. Castile is a land of farmers and shepherds. Where will these men come from? The fishing villages of the coast can provide hundreds, perhaps. But thousands?\"\n\nVilaragut nods. \"The Constable raises a fair point. We will need to recruit foreign sailors initially—Catalans, Portuguese, Genoese. And we must begin training Castilians. The naval academy Your Majesty mentioned... it should not be delayed.\"",

So by 1435, King Duarte (Edward) would be the king of Portugal.\n\nWait, the user says \"the recent passing of his father\" - if Henry's father João I died in 1433, that would be about 1.5-2 years ago by early 1435. But Henry is not the king.\n\nLet me check the family relationships:\n- João I of Portugal (died August 1433)\n- His sons included:\n  - Duarte (Edward), who became King Duarte I in 1433\n  - Pedro, Duke of Coimbra\n  - Henry (the Navigator), Duke of Viseu\n  - And others\n\nQueen Isabel of Portugal (Juan's first wife who died) was the daughter of João I, making her siblings with Duarte, Pedro, and Henry.\n\nSo the user seems confused about who is king. I should gently correct this - Henry the Navigator was never king. King Duarte I would be the ruler of Portugal in 1435, and he would be Isabel's brother (and thus Juan's brother-in-law).\n\nActually, let me re-read. The user says \"the new king Henry the navigator\" - this suggests in this alternate timeline, perhaps Henry became king instead of Duarte? But that would be a significant divergence. Let me check if the user has established this in the campaign...\n\nLooking at the character database and summaries, I see references to \"King João I\" attending the Te Deum in April 1433. But historically, João I died in August 1433. So either the timeline is slightly different, or this is after his death.\n \nThe narrative timeline suggests a potential historical discrepancy. By 1435, João I would have passed away, with Duarte I as the rightful successor. Henry the Navigator, despite his historical significance, was never the monarch. The user's reference to \"King Henry\" appears to deviate from historical records, warranting clarification about the actual royal lineage.\n\nI'll seek confirmation about the specific details of this alternate history scenario, ensuring accuracy in understanding the campaign's unique historical context.\n\nI need to clarify a historical point before proceeding.\n\nHistorical Note:\n\nHenry the Navigator was never King of Portugal. He was an Infante—a prince—the third son of King João I. He was Duke of Viseu and famous for sponsoring Portuguese exploration, but he never ruled.\n\nWhen King João I died (historically in August 1433), the throne passed to his eldest surviving son, King Duarte I (also called Edward I), who reigned from 1433 to 1438.\n\nThe Portuguese royal family in 1435:\n\nKing Duarte I — Now ruling, eldest son of João I, Isabel's brother\n\nInfante Pedro — Duke of Coimbra, second son\n\nInfante Henry — Duke of Viseu, \"the Navigator,\" third son\n\nQueen Leonor of Aragon — Duarte's wife\n\nDowager Queen Philippa — Already deceased (1415)\n\nIsabel (Juan's first wife) was Duarte's sister, making Duarte Juan's brother-in-law and Catalina's uncle.\n\nOptions:\n\nSend the letter and painting to King Duarte I (the actual king), offering condolences for their father João I's passing and inviting him to visit.\n\nSend a separate letter to Infante Henry specifically about exploration and maritime cooperation, since he controls Portugal's exploration efforts (though he has no political authority).\n\nIf you prefer, we can establish that in this alternate timeline, Henry became king instead of Duarte for some reason.\n\nWhich would you prefer?",

He is a scholarly, thoughtful man—known for writing books on horsemanship and governance—but less martial than his famous father. His brother Henry controls the exploration efforts from Sagres, spending every maravedí he can gather on expeditions down the African coast.\n\nJuan's relationship with the Portuguese royal family is strong. João I attended the Te Deum in Granada and shared a warm \"father\" moment with Juan. Isabel was beloved, and her death in childbirth was mourned in both kingdoms. Catalina is Duarte's niece by blood.\n\nSUCCESS FACTORS:\n\nJuan is family—widower of Duarte's sister, father of Duarte's niece Catalina\n\nThe gift is profoundly meaningful: Isabel's personal devotional painting, returned to her homeland\n\nJoão I and Juan had excellent relations; this goodwill likely transfers to Duarte\n\nPortugal and Castile recently cooperated on Gibraltar Strait security\n\nJuan offers cooperation rather than competition—attractive to resource-strapped Portugal\n\nNo demands or expectations stated—a gracious, low-pressure invitation\n\nHenry is obsessed with exploration; discussing with a wealthy, interested king would appeal to him\n\nJuan has demonstrated he has substantial coin and naval ambitions\n\nFAILURE FACTORS:\n\nDuarte is a new king, still consolidating his position—may be cautious about commitments\n\nHenry is deeply absorbed in his work at Sagres; leaving for weeks may not appeal\n\nPortuguese have a head start in Atlantic exploration—may be reluctant to share knowledge\n\nSending a royal prince to another king's court is a significant gesture requiring trust\n\nSome Portuguese may view Castilian \"cooperation\" with suspicion as encroachment\n\nHenry answers to Duarte, not himself—even if Henry wants to go, Duarte must approve\n\nGrief over João I's death may make the family less inclined toward diplomatic ventures\n\nD100 — PORTUGUESE RESPONSE TO INVITATION\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-10\nPolite Decline — Duarte thanks Juan warmly for the gift but declines. Henry is occupied, and Portugal prefers to manage its own affairs. The door remains open for future contact, but no visit.\n11-25\nDelayed Response — Duarte is moved by the gift and writes kindly, but makes no commitment. Perhaps in a year, when matters settle. Henry sends a separate, brief note of thanks but no indication of travel.\n26-40\nCautious Interest — Duarte accepts the gift graciously and expresses interest in cooperation. He proposes exchanging letters first to understand what Juan envisions before committing Henry to travel.\n41-55\nHenry Sends an Envoy — Duarte approves discussion but does not send Henry personally. Instead, one of Henry's experienced captains or administrators travels to Toledo to assess Castilian intentions and capabilities.\n56-70\nHenry Agrees to Visit (Brief) — Duarte, moved by the gift and family connection, permits Henry to visit Toledo for a short stay. Henry is curious but guarded—he will listen more than he shares.\n71-85\nHenry Visits with Interest — The gift deeply touches the family. Henry travels to Toledo genuinely interested in cooperation, bringing maps and discussing Portuguese discoveries openly. A real partnership may be possible.\n86-95\nDuarte and Henry Both Engage — Duarte himself writes a warm, substantive letter proposing formal discussions. Henry visits Toledo with authority to negotiate preliminary terms. The Portuguese see genuine opportunity.\n96-100\nProfound Family Reconnection — The painting unlocks deep emotion. Duarte expresses desire to meet his niece Catalina personally. Henry visits with full enthusiasm. The groundwork for a true Iberian maritime partnership is laid.\n\nShall I roll?",

That's an exceptional roll - \"Profound Family Reconnection.\" This is a beautiful outcome, especially given the emotional weight of the gift - Isabel's personal devotional painting being returned to her homeland.\n\nLet me write this response carefully. The Portuguese royal family is deeply moved by this gesture. Duarte wants to meet his niece Catalina, and Henry will visit with full enthusiasm. This sets up a potential Iberian maritime partnership.\n\nI should write this as a narrative scene - perhaps the arrival of the Portuguese response, and then the actual visit. Let me think about timing. It's late summer/early autumn 1434. A letter would take perhaps 2-3 weeks to reach Portugal, and a response another 2-3 weeks. Then Henry would need to travel, which could take another few weeks.\n\nSo we're looking at perhaps late autumn 1434 for Henry's arrival, or early winter. This works well with the timeline - Juan is setting things in motion before the Tenedos meeting in Spring 1435.\n\nI'll write the Portuguese response arriving, then the visit itself. This is a significant diplomatic development.\n\nProfound Family Reconnection\n\nToledo, Late October 1434\n\nThe Portuguese courier arrives bearing not one letter, but two—each sealed with royal arms, the wax still bearing the impression of the quinas, the five shields of Portugal.\n\nThe first is from King Duarte I himself. Álvaro brings it to you in your private chambers, his expression suggesting he has already noted the unusual weight of the correspondence.\n\nTo Our Beloved Brother Juan, by the Grace of God King of Castile and León, Defender of the Faith, Defensor Romaniae,\n\nYour gift has undone us.\n\nWhen the painting arrived, I could not look upon it for some hours. It was Isabel's—truly hers. I remember when she commissioned it, before she sailed to you. She said the Virgin's face reminded her of our mother. She took it with her so that she might never feel far from home.\n\nThat you would return it to us—that you understood what it meant—tells me more of your heart than any treaty or embassy ever could.\n\nMy brother Henrique wept when he saw it. He does not weep easily. He said: \"This is a man who loved her truly.\"\n\nYou speak of cooperation in matters of trade and exploration. I confess I have been cautious in my first year as king—there is much to learn, much to secure. But you are not a foreign prince to me. You are the father of my niece, the man who held my sister's hand when she passed from this world, the king who completed what our father dreamed of for Iberia.\n\nI wish to see Catalina. I wish to see the child who carries Isabel's blood. My queen Leonor speaks of little else since your letter arrived.\n\nHenrique will come to you first—he burns to discuss your naval ambitions, and I confess his enthusiasm for these matters exceeds my own understanding. But I intend to follow, perhaps in the spring, if you will receive us. I would bring Leonor. We would make it a family matter, not a state visit.\n\nUntil then, know that Portugal considers Castile not merely an ally, but kin.\n\nYour brother in Christ and in blood,\nDuarte, Rex Portugalliae\n\nThe second letter is shorter, written in a hurried but energetic hand.\n\nBrother King—\n\nI am coming. Duarte has given leave. I bring maps you have not seen and questions you may not expect.\n\nThe Atlantic is larger than anyone knows. What lies beyond the horizon will reshape the world. You have ships. You have gold. You have ambition. I have knowledge and men who have sailed where no Christian has sailed before.\n\nSeparately, we explore. Together, we might do something that history remembers.\n\nI depart within the week.\n\nHenrique, Infante of Portugal, Duke of Viseu\n\nÁlvaro sets down the letters. \"The Navigator himself, Your Majesty. And King Duarte speaks of visiting in spring.\" He pauses. \"A painting. You sent a painting, and you may have just reshaped Iberian politics.\"",

His beard is neatly trimmed, his eyes restless—taking in the Alcázar's architecture, the guards' equipment, the banners, everything, as if cataloguing it all for future reference.\n\nHe has never married. He has taken no mistress. Those who know him say he lives like a monk who happens to command ships instead of prayers.

He'll want to understand what Juan actually proposes - partnership, or Castilian encroachment on Portuguese discoveries?\n\nI should have Henry engage substantively, share some knowledge, but also probe Juan's intentions. What does \"cooperation\" actually mean? Who gets what?\n\nLet me write Henry's response - engaged, intellectually excited, but also shrewd.\n\nHenry's eyes widen slightly at your words. For a moment, the guarded diplomat falls away, and you see something else—a man who has spent twenty years pursuing a vision that most of Europe considers madness, hearing his own dreams spoken aloud by a king with the resources to make them real.\n\nHe grips your hand firmly.

Literally. They trade it for gold from kingdoms south of the desert. Kingdoms of wealth beyond imagination—Mali, Songhai.

Cowardice.\"\n\nHis finger traces the coastline past the cape.\n\n\"Last year, Gil Eanes passed it. He returned. The waters do not boil. There are no monsters.\" A fierce smile. \"There is only more coast. Stretching south further than anyone knew. And I intend to find where it ends.\"\n\nHe looks up at you, the smile fading into something more calculating.\n\n\"You speak of China. A route around the Muslims. I have thought of this for twenty years, Your Majesty. Prester John—the Christian king said to rule beyond the lands of Islam. If he exists, if we could reach him by sea, we could crush the Mohammedans between two Christian forces.\"\n\nHe straightens, arms crossed.\n\n\"But here is my question, brother king. Portugal has bled for this knowledge. Ships lost, men drowned, fortunes spent. I have begged, borrowed, and scraped for every expedition.

This is about as good an approach as possible.\n\nGiven the 97 roll on the initial contact and Juan's excellent speech here, Henry should be genuinely moved and interested.

Twenty years I have been called a fool, a dreamer, a man who throws gold into the sea.\"\n\nHe looks up at you.\n\n\"And now a king stands before me and says: I will fund your every expedition.\"\n\nHe laughs—a short, sharp sound, almost disbelieving.\n\n\"Do you know what I could do with your treasury, Your Majesty? I could have ten ships on the water by spring. Twenty by next year. I could push past every cape, map every river mouth, find the source of the Saharan gold before this decade ends.\" His voice rises with passion, then catches itself. He takes a breath.\n\n\"But I am not king. Duarte must approve any formal arrangement. And Duarte, for all his love, is cautious. He will ask questions I cannot answer alone.\"\n\nHenry straightens and begins ticking off fingers—a habit, you notice, that mirrors your own admiral Vilaragut.\n\n\"First: priority. If Portuguese ships discover a coast, a river, a kingdom—is it Portuguese? Or does Castile claim equal rights because Castilian gold funded the voyage? My captains have died for the charts I carry. Their widows would curse my name if I gave that knowledge away.\"\n\n\"Second: command. Whose captains sail? Whose navigators chart the course? If Castilian gold builds a ship, but a Portuguese pilot guides it, whose flag flies from the mast?\"\n\n\"Third: trade. If we find the gold kingdoms, the spice routes, the passage to the East—how are the profits divided? Does the investor take all, or does the explorer keep his share?\"\n\nHe spreads his hands.\n\n\"These are not accusations, brother king. They are the questions Duarte will ask. The questions our merchants will scream. The questions I myself must answer before I pledge Portuguese blood to a joint venture.\"\n\nHe moves closer, lowering his voice as if sharing a confidence.\n\n\"But I will tell you what I want, since you have been honest with me. I want to see what lies beyond the horizon before I die. I want to find Prester John, or prove he does not exist. I want to break the Moorish stranglehold on African gold and Eastern spices. I want Portugal—and now perhaps Castile too—to become the masters of the Ocean Sea.\"\n\nHe meets your eyes directly.\n\n\"If you can answer those three questions in a way that honors Portuguese sacrifice and still serves Castilian interests, I believe Duarte will agree. More than that—I will champion it to him.\"\n\nA pause.\n\n\"So. Priority. Command. Trade. How does the King of Castile envision this partnership?\"",

      "text": "Portuguese exploration in this period typically used caravels - small, maneuverable ships that could sail close to the wind. They were relatively inexpensive compared to large carracks.\n\nA caravel might cost 200-500 florins to build (smaller than the naos and carracks in the naval plan).\n\nExpedition costs would include:\n- Ship construction or charter\n- Crew wages (typically 15-30 men per caravel, paid for months)\n- Provisions (food, water, supplies for extended voyages)\n- Equipment (navigation instruments, ropes, sails, repairs)\n- Trade goods (to exchange with any peoples encountered)\n\nHenry's expeditions were typically modest - one to three ships at a time, pushing incrementally down the African coast.\n\nBased on the financial figures we've been using in this campaign:\n- A small fishing vessel: 200-400 florins\n- A nao: 800-1,200 florins\n- A carrack: 2,500-3,500 florins\n\nA caravel would be similar to the fishing vessels or slightly more - perhaps 300-500 florins.\n\nAn expedition (ship + crew + provisions for a year) might cost:\n- Single ship expedition: 500-800 florins\n- Two-three ship expedition: 1,500-2,500 florins\n\nHenry's annual budget from his various sources (the Order of Christ, his ducal revenues, royal grants) was probably in the range of 2,000-5,000 florins equivalent, and often stretched thin.\n\nJuan's treasury is sitting at over 500,000 florins. The contrast should be stark - what seems like a fortune to Henry is pocket change to Juan.\n\nHenry blinks. The question—so direct, so practical—seems to catch him off guard. He is accustomed to arguing philosophy, strategy, destiny. Not accounting.\n\n\"The expeditions?\" He runs a hand through his beard, calculating. \"It depends on the scope. A single caravel—a small, nimble ship suited for exploration—costs perhaps three hundred florins to build. Crew wages for a year, provisions, equipment, trade goods for any peoples we encounter... another two hundred, perhaps two hundred fifty.\"\n\nHe begins pacing again, the numbers flowing more easily now.\n\n\"A modest expedition—one ship, pushing past known waters, mapping coastline, returning within six months—five hundred to six hundred florins. A serious venture—two or three caravels, establishing contact with African kingdoms, staying out for a full year—fifteen hundred to two thousand florins.\"\n\nHe stops, turning to face you.\n\n\"In a good year, I can mount two expeditions. Perhaps three if I squeeze every source dry. My revenues from the Order of Christ, my estates in Viseu, whatever Duarte can spare...\" He shrugs. \"Four thousand florins in a generous year. Less in most. And from that I must also maintain Sagres, pay my cartographers, support the families of men who do not return.\"\n\nHe gestures at the map still spread on the table.\n\n\"Twenty years of this, Your Majesty. Twenty years of scraping together enough to send one or two ships at a time, watching them vanish over the horizon and praying they return. Some do not. And each loss sets us back—not just the ship and crew, but the knowledge they carried with them.\"\n\nHis voice takes on a frustrated edge.\n\n\"Do you know what I could accomplish with ten thousand florins in a single year? I could have five ships probing different stretches of coast simultaneously. I could establish a permanent post south of Bojador—a base from which to push further without returning to Portugal each time. I could hire the best navigators in Christendom, build proper shipyards at Lagos dedicated to caravels.\"\n\nHe laughs bitterly.\n\n\"Ten thousand florins. A fortune to me. I have heard you reserved two hundred thousand for your fleet.\"\n\nHe lets that number hang in the air.\n\n\"So when you ask what I need... I scarcely know how to answer. I have spent two decades learning to survive on crumbs. You are offering me a banquet, and I am not certain my stomach can even conceive of it.\"\n\nHe crosses his arms, studying you with renewed intensity.\n\n\"What I need and what I could use are different questions. I need perhaps six thousand florins a year to double my current pace of discovery. I could use twenty thousand a year to transform exploration from a slow crawl into a true enterprise—multiple expeditions, permanent bases, proper charts and instruments, trained pilots in numbers rather than handfuls.\"\n\nA pause.\n\n\"What did you have in mind?\"",

      "text": "Henry is being offered something remarkable here. Let me think through his reaction carefully.\n\nJuan is offering:\n1. 10,000 florins as an immediate gift - no strings attached except hope for future cooperation\n2. This is MORE than double Henry's entire annual budget\n3. Full Portuguese control over the expeditions\n4. Access to Castilian ports\n5. Only asks that discoveries of salt and gold be shared\n6. Proposes a future joint trading post - but not demanding it now\n\nThis is an extraordinarily generous offer. Henry has just admitted he could \"transform exploration\" with 20,000 florins a year. Juan is giving him half that RIGHT NOW as a gift.\n\nWhat would Henry think?\n\nSUCCESS FACTORS:\n- This is incredibly generous - more than he ever dreamed of getting\n- Juan is asking for almost nothing in return right now\n- It preserves Portuguese pride and control\n- Henry WANTS to explore - this enables his life's dream\n- Juan explicitly says Portugal is \"in full control\"\n- The \"gift\" framing makes it easy for Duarte to accept - no formal treaty needed\n- Access to Castilian ports would genuinely help - shorter supply lines for some routes\n- Juan isn't demanding immediate answers on the hard questions\n\nCONCERNS HENRY MIGHT HAVE:\n- Is this too good to be true? What's the catch?\n- Will Duarte see this as creating an obligation?\n- Is Juan trying to buy influence over Portuguese exploration?\n- The \"future trading post\" idea - this is where the real negotiation will happen\n\nBut honestly, Henry is a practical man obsessed with exploration. He's just been handed the keys to his dreams. He would be emotional, grateful, perhaps a bit overwhelmed.\n\nHe'd probably:\n1. Be genuinely moved\n2. Want to accept immediately but know he must consult Duarte\n3. Recognize this creates goodwill and obligation, but see it as worth it\n4. Want to discuss the trading post idea more\n\nThis doesn't need a dice roll - this is Henry's reaction to an incredibly generous offer that addresses his concerns. He's not being asked to give up anything Portugal already has. He's being given resources with minimal conditions.\n\nI'll craft a response that captures his profound sense of opportunity and cautious excitement. His words will reflect both gratitude and strategic thinking, acknowledging the transformative potential of Juan's proposal while maintaining diplomatic prudence.\n\nHenry stands very still.\n\nFor a man who has spent two decades arguing, cajoling, and begging for every coin, the offer seems to strike him like a physical blow. His mouth opens, closes. He looks at the map on the table, then back at you.\n\n\"Ten thousand florins.\" He repeats it as if testing whether the words are real. \"As a gift.\"\n\nHe walks to the window, looking out over Toledo's rooftops without seeing them. When he speaks again, his voice is rough.\n\n\"You understand what you are offering. That sum would let me launch expeditions I have planned for years but never had the means to attempt. I could send ships to probe the coast beyond Cape Bojador while simultaneously pushing toward the Canaries and the African interior. I could hire pilots from Genoa and Venice who know the Mediterranean stars and teach them the Atlantic ones.\"\n\nHe turns back, and there is something vulnerable in his expression—a man who has armored himself against disappointment for so long that hope feels dangerous.\n\n\"And you ask only that I share what we find. Not claim it. Not control it. Share.\"\n\nHe crosses back to you, his stride quickening.\n\n\"Duarte will accept this. How could he not? You offer gold with one hand and friendship with the other. You make no demands, set no conditions beyond goodwill. You even frame it as a gift to him rather than a transaction with me.\" A short laugh. \"You are either the most generous king in Christendom or the most cunning. Perhaps both.\"\n\nHe stops before you, serious now.\n\n\"The trading post—yes. If we find the gold markets, the salt sources, there will be wealth enough for both kingdoms. A shared post makes sense. Portuguese pilots who know the waters, Castilian coin to build the fortifications, both flags flying together.\" He nods slowly. \"It would take negotiation. Duarte will want guarantees. The merchants of Lisbon will scream about competition. But it can be done.\"\n\nHe extends his hand.\n\n\"I cannot formally accept on my brother's behalf. But I can tell you this: I will return to Portugal and speak for this arrangement with every breath in my body. I will tell Duarte that the King of Castile has offered us partnership without conditions, gold without chains, and friendship sealed by the memory of Isabel.\"\n\nHis grip is firm.\n\n\"And I will tell him that if Portugal refuses this hand, we are fools who deserve to be overtaken by those with greater vision.\"\n\nHe releases your hand but does not step back.\n\n\"There is one thing I would ask, if you permit. Not as a condition—you have set none, and I will not either. But as a hope.\"\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\"When we find what lies beyond the horizon—the gold kingdoms, the spice routes, perhaps even the passage to the East—I would ask that Castile and Portugal present themselves to those distant peoples not as rivals, but as Christendom. One faith, one purpose. Let the Moors see a united Iberia coming for them from the sea as you have come for them from the land.\"\n\nHis eyes burn with the fervor of a true believer.\n\n\"Can you promise me that, brother king?\"",

This is a significant diplomatic moment.\n\nHenry is a visionary himself - he understands grand dreams. But I need to be careful here. Juan is essentially hinting at Portuguese incorporation into his growing empire of crowns. Henry is not king - he cannot commit to anything like this. And even as a dreamer, he is Portuguese. He loves his country.\n\nLet me think about how Henry would react:\n\n1. He's impressed by Juan's vision and ambition\n2. He shares the anti-Muslim sentiment (the Order of Christ, which funds his expeditions, was founded from the dissolved Templars specifically to fight Islam)\n3. But \"including Portugal in this list\" of unified crowns is... a big statement\n4. Henry is not the heir - Duarte has children or will have them\n5. This could be taken as a hint at annexation, which would alarm any Portuguese patriot\n\nHenry is a pragmatist in some ways, a dreamer in others. He might:\n- Appreciate the vision\n- Be cautious about the \"uniting crowns\" language regarding Portugal\n- Recognize that Juan is being honest and open\n- Deflect diplomatically while not rejecting the friendship\n\nHe should respond thoughtfully - acknowledging the dream, perhaps sharing his own complementary vision, but being careful not to speak for Portugal's sovereignty. He's already committed to championing the exploration partnership - that's one thing. But Portuguese independence is another matter entirely.\n\nI should have Henry respond with enthusiasm for the crusading vision, perhaps note the irony that his exploration is also about flanking the Muslims, but gently sidestep the \"uniting crowns\" implication regarding Portugal without being rude or breaking the warm atmosphere.\n\nHenry is quiet for a long moment. His expression shifts through several phases—surprise, calculation, and something that might be admiration or wariness, or perhaps both.\n\n\"You dream large, Your Majesty.\" He speaks slowly, choosing his words with care. \"Aragon, Naples, León, Castile, Byzantium... and Portugal. That is not a kingdom you describe. That is an empire. An empire built around the Mediterranean like Rome itself.\"\n\nHe moves back to the map on the table, tracing the coastlines with his finger.\n\n\"I am not king. I cannot speak to crowns and unions—that is for Duarte and his heirs to consider, and they will have their own thoughts.\" A pause. \"Portugal has been independent for three centuries. We are proud of that. My father spent his youth fighting Castile before he spent his age befriending it.\"\n\nHe looks up, meeting your eyes.\n\n\"But I will tell you what I see, brother king. I see that you and I want the same thing by different roads. You strike east, at the Ottoman heart. I strike south, seeking to outflank the entire Muslim world by sea. If I find the passage to the East—if Portuguese ships can reach the spice lands without passing through waters the Turk controls—we will have done to Islam what Hannibal tried to do to Rome.\"\n\nHis finger traces around Africa's coast, past the known edges of the map into blank parchment.\n\n\"You take Constantinople. I take the Ocean Sea. The Moors find themselves surrounded—Christian armies to the north, Christian ships to the south and east. That is a dream worth dreaming.\"\n\nHe straightens, a thin smile crossing his weathered face.\n\n\"As for uniting crowns... I am a sailor, not a statesman. I will leave such questions to kings and their councils. But I will say this:\"\n\nHe steps closer, lowering his voice.\n\n\"If you truly wish Portugal to stand with you—not beneath you, but with you—then what you have done today matters more than any treaty. You have offered friendship without conditions. You have honored my sister's memory. You have funded my life's work without demanding control.\"\n\nHe places a hand over his heart.\n\n\"When Duarte asks me what manner of man the King of Castile is, I will tell him: He is a man who builds alliances with generosity rather than force. A man who sees that two kingdoms working together accomplish more than one kingdom conquering the other.\"\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\"That is not a promise of crowns, brother king. But it may be worth more. A Portugal that chooses to stand with Castile is stronger than one that is compelled to. And I think... I think you understand this.\"\n\nHe glances toward the door, then back to you.\n\n\"Now. You have given me ten thousand florins and more hope than I have felt in years. Will you show me these shipyards you are building? I would see what Castilian ambition looks like in timber and rope. And perhaps—\" a genuine smile now, the first you have seen from him, \"—I might offer some suggestions.

Portugal and Castile have been cooperating (Gibraltar Strait security)\n7. The family connection is strong\n8. Henry himself would benefit from Ottoman defeat - it aligns with his vision of outflanking Islam\n\nHenry would likely:\n- Acknowledge this is beyond his authority\n- Give his honest assessment of whether Duarte might agree\n- Perhaps note the practical limitations (Portugal's fleet size, Portugal's own needs)\n- Express personal support for the idea\n- Maybe suggest how to frame it to Duarte\n\nPortugal's fleet in this era was significant but not huge. They had caravels for exploration, some war galleys, and transport ships. They would need to keep some for their own defense and exploration.\n\nThis is a reasonable request that Henry would view favorably, but he'd need to be honest about the limits of what he can promise.\n\nHenry's expression grows more serious. This is no longer a matter of exploration and dreams—this is war, strategy, the hard calculus of ships and soldiers.\n\n\"You ask me to speak for my brother on matters of war.\" He shakes his head slowly. \"That I cannot do.

He wept when we received word of her death. And he knows—as our father knew—that the Ottoman is the enemy of all Christendom.

The world will be smaller, darker, more dangerous.\"\n\nHe begins pacing again, working through the problem as a sailor would.\n\n\"Fair compensation, you say. That matters. Duarte cannot give away Portuguese ships while Portuguese merchants pay taxes to maintain them. But a loan, properly paid, with guarantees for losses...\" He nods slowly. \"That is different. That is business, not charity. The Cortes cannot object to profitable business.\"\n\nHe stops, facing you directly.\n\n\"Here is what I will tell my brother, if you permit. I will say: The King of Castile has given us ten thousand florins to explore the African coast. He asks nothing in return but friendship and shared knowledge. Now he asks whether, in his hour of need, Portugal might loan him ships at fair rates—not as a gift, but as a transaction that profits both kingdoms.\"\n\nHis eyes narrow thoughtfully.\n\n\"I will also remind him that every ship Portugal loans to transport Castilian soldiers east is a ship fighting the Ottoman. And every Ottoman galley sunk by Castilian knights is a galley that will never threaten Portuguese trade.\"\n\nHe spreads his hands.\n\n\"I cannot promise he will agree. But I can promise I will argue for it. And I think—\" he pauses, weighing his words, \"—I think the answer will be yes, if the terms are fair and the need is genuine.\"\n\nA slight smile.\n\n\"Duarte is cautious, but he is not blind. He sees what you are building. He knows that if you succeed in the East, Portugal gains a powerful ally and a weakened enemy.

He speaks to her in Portuguese—gentle words about her mother, about Portugal, about the sea that Isabel crossed to come to Castile.\n\nCatalina listens with the grave attention children sometimes give to things they do not fully understand but sense are important. Then she presents him with a wooden block from her collection—the highest honor she knows how to bestow.\n\n\"Para ti,\" she says solemnly.
