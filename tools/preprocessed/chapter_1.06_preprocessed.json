      "text": "The mission is straightforward: three experienced men (Captain Fernán has been with Juan throughout, proven loyal and capable) riding fast to deliver a message to Álvaro de Luna in Valladolid.\n\nFactors in favor of success:\n1. Captain Fernán is experienced, loyal, and has been Juan's military commander\n2. Three riders traveling light and fast - harder to intercept\n3. Direct route from Barcelona to Valladolid is well-established\n4. They have royal authority if challenged\n5. Álvaro de Luna controls Valladolid and the royal administration\n6. The mission is simple message delivery, not complex political maneuvering\n7. Two weeks is reasonable time for the journey\n\nPotential obstacles:\n1. The Infantes have been intercepting correspondence (though Juan doesn't know this yet)\n2. Road hazards - bandits, accidents, weather\n3. The Infantes have some support in northern Castile\n4. Horses could go lame or riders could fall ill\n5. The Captain could be recognized and detained\n\nHowever, the interception network seems to be focused on written correspondence through normal channels, not fast riders on direct royal business. Captain Fernán is competent and traveling with two guards. The route from Barcelona to Valladolid, while long, passes through mostly controlled territory.\n \nI assess the mission's probability as moderately high - strong advantages counterbalance potential risks. The strategic advantages outweigh the potential obstacles, making success more probable than failure. While challenges exist, the mission's core elements - speed, royal authority, and competent leadership - provide a solid foundation for accomplishing the objective.\n\nLooking at Captain Fernán's mission to deliver the arrest warrant to Álvaro de Luna, let me assess the probability of success.\n\nProbability Assessment: Likely to succeed\n\nFactors in Your Favor:\n\nCaptain Fernán's proven competence: He's been your loyal commander throughout the journey, knows how to handle himself\n\nThree-rider configuration: Harder to stop than a lone messenger, can help each other if problems arise\n\nSpeed and light travel: Riding hard with minimal baggage makes them difficult to intercept\n\nÁlvaro's control of Valladolid: Your destination is firmly in friendly hands with your Constable in charge\n\nClear, direct route: Barcelona to Valladolid is a well-traveled road through mostly stable territory\n\nRoyal seal and authority: The letter bears your official seal - anyone who interferes commits treason\n\nPotential Obstacles:\n\nTwo-week journey: Long distance means more opportunities for mishap - thrown shoes, lame horses, illness\n\nThe Infantes' northern influence: Parts of the route pass near territories where the Infantes have supporters\n\nStandard road dangers: Bandits, bad weather, accidents are always possible\n\nPolitical tensions: News travels - the Infantes may have watchers on major roads looking for royal messengers\n\nUnknown interception network: (Though you're unaware, the Infantes have been reading your correspondence)\n\nAssessment:\n\nThis is a straightforward military courier mission - the type Captain Fernán has likely undertaken before. He's traveling with support, on fast horses, with clear orders and destination. While the journey is long and some risk exists, barring bad luck or unexpected Infante interference, he should reach Álvaro successfully.\n\nThe real question isn't whether the message reaches Álvaro, but what happens after - though that's beyond this action's scope.\n\nPlease roll your dice to determine the outcome of Captain Fernán's mission.",

      "text": "The arrest order is arriving in early September (Captain Fernán left August 19, two weeks travel).\n\nFactors to consider:\n- The Infantes are still powerful princes of Aragon\n- Arresting them could trigger civil war\n- They have military forces (~5,000 troops total)\n- They have warning systems and spy networks (intercepting correspondence)\n- Álvaro is competent but this is extremely provocative\n- Juan gave Álvaro discretion (\"proceed only if there are grounds for trial\")\n- The Infantes are weakened but not defeated\n- They're members of Aragonese royal family\n\nThis is a very dangerous action. The Infantes aren't just nobles - they're princes of Aragon, one is King of Navarre. Arresting them is essentially declaring war on the Aragonese royal family.\n\nLooking at Álvaro de Luna's attempt to arrest the Infantes de Aragón on charges of rebellion, let me assess the probability of success.\n\nProbability Assessment: Likely to fail\n\nMajor Obstacles:\n\nThe Infantes are forewarned: Their spy network has been intercepting your correspondence (though you don't know this). They likely know arrest orders are coming\n\nThey're Aragonese royalty: Not just Castilian nobles but foreign princes - Infante Juan is King of Navarre, both are brothers to Alfonso V of Aragon\n\nThey still have military force: ~5,000 troops between their households and allied nobles - enough to resist arrest\n\nTheir strategic positions: They control Arévalo fortress and have retreated to fortified estates, not caught in the open\n\nInternational implications: Arresting them risks war with Aragon and Navarre\n\nNoble uncertainty: While 60% of nobles stayed neutral, forcibly arresting princes might push them to pick sides\n\nPhysical difficulty: The Infantes aren't at court where they could be easily seized - they're on their estates with armed retainers\n\nFactors in Álvaro's Favor:\n\nRoyal authority: He has legitimate arrest warrant from the king for proven rebellion\n\nControl of administration: Commands royal forces and major cities\n\nThe Infantes' weakened position: Their revolt failed, they're politically isolated\n\nÁlvaro's competence: He successfully defended the realm, he's politically skilled\n\nDiscretionary orders: You wisely gave him flexibility (\"proceed only if grounds for trial\")\n\nSome noble support: 30-35% actively support the crown\n\nAssessment:\n\nWhile Álvaro has legal authority and the Infantes are weakened, actually arresting royal princes with military forces on fortified estates is extremely difficult. They're not courtiers who can be seized at dinner - they're armed princes who likely know you're coming. Álvaro might successfully demand their surrender, but physically arresting them seems unlikely without triggering open warfare.\n\nThe most probable outcome is a tense standoff rather than successful arrests.\n\nPlease roll your dice to determine what happens when Álvaro attempts to execute the arrest warrant.",

What happens in Castile through September\n5. The situation Juan will find when he arrives in Seville\n\nThe Infantes have been intercepting correspondence, so they likely knew this was coming. The failure means they weren't arrested but it doesn't have to be catastrophic - just a failure to achieve the goal with some negative consequences.\n\nTimeline:\n- August 19: Fernán departs Barcelona\n- Early September (around Sept 2-3): Fernán reaches Valladolid\n- Early-mid September: Álvaro attempts arrests\n- Mid-September: Fallout from failed arrests\n- Late September: Juan arrives in Seville and learns what happened\n\nLet me craft this narrative.\n\nThe Captain's Ride and the Failed Arrests\n\nAugust 19 - September 28, 1430\n\nCaptain Fernán's Mission (August 19 - September 2)\n\nThe Hard Ride\n\nCaptain Fernán Alonso de Robles, with Martín and Felipe, departed Barcelona at dawn on August 19th. They rode like men pursued by demons, changing horses at way stations, sleeping only when absolutely necessary.\n\nDay 4 (August 22): Crossed into Aragonese territory near Lérida. Local garrison noted their passage but didn't interfere - the Consell Reial's safe passage held.\n\nDay 7 (August 25): Entered Castilian territory near Soria. Fernán relaxed slightly - home soil at last. They pressed harder, knowing they were close.\n\nDay 10 (August 28): Felipe's horse threw a shoe badly. They lost six hours finding a farrier in a small village. Fernán paced like a caged wolf.\n\nDay 14 (September 2): Exhausted, saddle-sore, but intact, the three riders clattered into Valladolid's main gate. Guards recognized the Captain immediately.\n\n\"Christ's blood, Fernán! We thought you were with the King!\"\n\n\"I am. Where's Don Álvaro?\"\n\n\"The palace. He'll want to see you immediately.\"\n\nDelivering the Orders\n\nÁlvaro de Luna received Fernán in his private study within the hour. The Constable looked older, worn from months of holding the kingdom together.\n\n\"Captain. I assume this isn't a social visit.\"\n\nFernán handed over the sealed letter. Álvaro read it twice, his expression darkening.\n\n\"Arrest the Infantes. On charges of rebellion.\" He set the letter down carefully. \"His Majesty understands what this means?\"\n\n\"He was very clear, my lord. They rebelled while he was on pilgrimage. They must face consequences. Though he also writes you should proceed only if there are grounds for trial.\"\n\nÁlvaro stood and walked to the window overlooking the city. \"Oh, there are grounds. They seized royal fortresses. They attempted to rally the nobility against the crown. They portrayed His Majesty as unstable.\" He turned back. \"The question isn't whether they're guilty. It's whether arresting them is possible without starting a civil war.\"\n\n\"What are your orders for me, Lord Constable?\"\n\n\"Rest. Eat. Sleep in a real bed. I need to think about how to execute this. And Captain... well done. Fourteen days from Barcelona is exceptional time.\"\n\nÁlvaro's Attempt (September 3-10)\n\nThe War Council (September 3)\n\nÁlvaro assembled his most trusted advisors:\n\nDiego López de Stúñiga, commander of royal forces\n\nJuan de Daza, treasury official and intelligence gatherer\n\nCount Diego Gómez de Sandoval, monitoring noble factions\n\nBishop Juan de Cerezuela, Álvaro's ally in the Church\n\n\"The King has ordered the arrest of the Infantes de Aragón for rebellion,\" Álvaro announced.\n\nSilence. Then Diego López spoke: \"They're at their estates with at least 2,000 household troops. We'd need to assault fortified positions.\"\n\n\"Or we could summon them to appear,\" suggested the Bishop. \"Publicly demand they present themselves for trial.\"\n\nJuan de Daza shook his head. \"My sources say they've been expecting something. They've been strengthening their positions, calling in debts, securing supplies. They won't come willingly.\"\n\nCount Sandoval added grimly: \"Several neutral nobles have received letters from Infante Juan. He's claiming the King has been 'bewitched' in Rome, that Álvaro is using forged orders to eliminate rivals. Some are listening.\"\n\nThe Public Summons (September 5)\n\nÁlvaro chose the middle path. In Valladolid's main square, heralds proclaimed:\n\n\"By order of His Majesty Juan II, King of Castile and León: The Infantes Don Juan and Don Enrique de Aragón are hereby summoned to present themselves to royal justice to answer charges of rebellion, seizure of royal property, and conspiracy against the crown. They have ten days to surrender themselves peacefully. Failure to appear will be considered admission of guilt and act of continued rebellion.\"\n\nThe proclamation was copied and sent to every major city in Castile.\n\nThe Infantes' Response (September 7)\n\nA herald arrived under flag of truce from Arévalo fortress with the Infantes' reply:\n\n\"We, Juan and Enrique, Infantes of Aragón, deny all charges of rebellion. We acted to preserve the stability of Castile during our cousin's extended absence, when he abandoned his realm for foreign adventures. We question the legitimacy of orders issued in the King's absence and demand to see His Majesty personally before submitting to any proceedings. We will not surrender ourselves to Don Álvaro de Luna, whom we consider party to this conflict rather than neutral arbiter of justice.\"\n\nThey also sent copies of their response to every major noble house, the Archbishop of Toledo, and King Alfonso V in Naples.\n\nThe Failed Arrest Attempt (September 10)\n\nÁlvaro had to act. He assembled 1,500 royal troops and marched toward Arévalo, the nearest Infante stronghold. But when they arrived, they found:\n\nThe fortress fully garrisoned with 800 men\n\nThe Infantes' allied nobles had sent reinforcements\n\nThe surrounding countryside had been stripped of supplies\n\nMost critically: The Infantes themselves weren't there\n\nThey had withdrawn to separate locations - Infante Juan to his wife's estates near the Navarrese border, Infante Enrique to fortified positions in the north. They'd divided their forces, making simultaneous arrest impossible.\n\nWhen Álvaro demanded entry to Arévalo, the garrison commander (loyal to the Infantes) responded: \"This fortress is held in the name of stability and proper governance. We await the King's personal command, not the orders of his over-mighty subject.\"\n\nThe Standoff\n\nÁlvaro faced an impossible choice:\n\nAssault Arévalo: Would succeed but with heavy casualties, and the Infantes weren't even there\n\nPursue the Infantes separately: Would divide his forces dangerously\n\nMaintain siege: Would tie down troops needed elsewhere\n\nWithdraw: Would look weak but preserve forces\n\nAfter three days of tense standoff, Álvaro withdrew to Valladolid. He'd successfully avoided bloodshed but failed to arrest the Infantes.\n\nSeptember Developments in Castile\n\nThe Noble Response (September 11-20)\n\nThe failed arrest attempt had immediate consequences:\n\nThose Supporting the Crown (30-35%) rallied more firmly to Álvaro:\n\n\"The Infantes are proven traitors refusing royal justice\"\n\nSeveral offered troops if needed\n\nCities like Burgos and Toledo explicitly banned the Infantes from entering\n\nThe Neutral Majority (50-55%) grew more nervous:\n\nMany withdrew to their estates to wait\n\nSome began fortifying their own positions\n\nLetters flew between noble houses discussing contingencies\n\nCommon question: \"Is the King truly in command, or has Álvaro seized power?\"\n\nThe Infantes' Supporters (15-20%) grew bolder:\n\nClaimed this proved Álvaro was tyrant using king's name\n\nSome began mustering their own forces\n\nMaster of Santiago (Luis de Guzmán) publicly questioned the arrest order's legitimacy\n\nLetters from Aragon (September 15)\n\nKing Alfonso V, from Naples, sent formal protest:\n\n\"To our beloved cousin Juan of Castile (when this reaches him) and to Don Álvaro de Luna who currently governs: We are gravely concerned by reports of attempts to arrest our brothers without proper trial or evidence. Such actions against princes of Aragon constitute hostile acts. We trust cooler heads will prevail and this matter will be resolved when Our cousin returns to exercise personal judgment.\"\n\nThe threat was clear: arrest the Infantes and risk war with Aragon.\n\nThe Church's Position (September 18)\n\nThe Archbishop of Toledo, technically part of the regency council, issued a carefully worded statement:\n\n\"The Church counsels patience and reconciliation. These matters should await His Majesty's return. We pray all parties will refrain from actions that might spill Christian blood.\"\n\nTranslation: The Church wouldn't support civil war over this.\n\nIntelligence Reports (September 20-25)\n\nJuan de Daza and Diego Gómez de Sandoval gathered disturbing intelligence:\n\nThe Infantes' Network:\n\nThey'd known the arrest order was coming (source unknown)\n\nThey'd prepared safe houses and escape routes\n\nThey were actively recruiting more nobles with promises of positions once \"proper governance\" was restored\n\nThey'd sent agents to Granada suggesting Castile was too divided to launch any crusade\n\nEconomic Impact:\n\nTrade disrupted by uncertainty\n\nSome merchants withdrawing funds from royal banks\n\nTax collection down 15% as collectors feared entering disputed areas\n\nMilitary expenses mounting with troops on alert\n\nPopular Sentiment:\n\nCommon people confused and frightened\n\nRumors wild: \"The King is dead,\" \"The King has become a monk,\" \"Álvaro has imprisoned the King\"\n\nSome villages preparing for war\n\nOthers just want to harvest crops in peace\n\nÁlvaro's Holding Action (September 25-28)\n\nBy late September, Álvaro had achieved a tense stability:\n\nWhat He Managed:\n\nPrevented open civil war\n\nKept major cities loyal\n\nMaintained government functions\n\nProtected royal revenues (mostly)\n\nAvoided giving Infantes martyrdom through bloodshed\n\nWhat He Failed to Do:\n\nArrest the Infantes as ordered\n\nPrevent them from strengthening position\n\nStop erosion of royal authority\n\nQuiet growing doubts about the King's status\n\nHis Message to Juan (sent September 26, will reach Seville soon after Juan):\n\n\"Your Majesty,\n\nYour orders regarding the Infantes have been received and acted upon. They refused summons to trial and have withdrawn to fortified positions. Attempted arrest would require military campaign resulting in significant bloodshed.\n\nThe realm holds, but tensions mount daily. Your personal presence is urgently needed. Some question whether you truly issued these orders or whether I act independently. Others spread rumors you've died or abdicated.\n\nI've preserved your authority and prevented open warfare, but cannot maintain this balance indefinitely. The Infantes grow bolder, neutrals grow fearful, and even loyalists grow doubtful.\n\nCome swiftly. Show yourself to your people. Whatever you achieved in Rome, we need you here now.\n\nYour servant,\nÁlvaro de Luna\"\n\nThe Situation Awaiting Juan (Late September 1430)\n\nWhen Juan arrives in Seville (which you haven't reached yet), he will find:\n\nThe Good News:\n\nNo civil war has erupted\n\nMajor cities remain loyal\n\nGovernment still functions\n\nHis core supporters held firm\n\nThe Infantes exposed as refusing royal justice\n\nThe Bad News:\n\nThe Infantes remain free and defiant\n\nThey've strengthened their position\n\nNoble neutrality hardening into fear\n\nRoyal authority questioned\n\nAragon threatening intervention\n\nRumors about the King running wild\n\nEconomic disruption beginning\n\nGranada watching Castilian weakness\n\nThe Immediate Challenges:\n\nMust show himself publicly to dispel rumors\n\nMust decide whether to pursue arrests or seek reconciliation\n\nMust convince nobles the crusade is still viable\n\nMust respond to Alfonso V's threat\n\nMust restore confidence in royal authority\n\nMust prevent Infantes from sabotaging November 8 council\n\nThe Hidden Danger (unknown to Juan):\nThe Infantes knew the arrest was coming because they've been reading his letters. They're prepared for his every move. This intelligence advantage remains their secret weapon.\n\nCaptain Fernán awaits in Valladolid, ready to ride south when summoned. Álvaro holds the center but watches the edges crumble. The Infantes plot their next move from their fortresses.\n\nThe kingdom holds its breath, waiting for its young king to return from his holy journey and face the crisis his absence—and his orders—have created.",

      "text": "Juan II of Castile in 1430 (we've aged him down to 18 for the game):\n- Historically, Juan II was born in 1405 and died in 1454\n- His father was Henry III of Castile (died 1406)\n- His mother was Catherine of Lancaster\n\nJuan II's siblings:\n- María of Castile (his sister, married to Alfonso V of Aragon) - in our game she's in Barcelona\n- Catherine of Castile (another sister, married to Infante Henry, Duke of Villena)\n\nSo if Juan II died without children, and his siblings died without children, who would inherit?\n\nWe need to go back up the family tree to Henry III's siblings or further back to John I of Castile (Juan II's grandfather).\n\nHenry III's siblings:\n- Ferdinand I of Aragon (born 1380, died 1416) - He was actually Henry III's brother! He became King of Aragon through the Compromise of Caspe in 1412.\n\nWait, this is important - Ferdinand I of Aragon was actually a Castilian prince (Infante) before becoming King of Aragon. He was the younger brother of Henry III of Castile.\n\nSo the Infantes de Aragón (Juan and Enrique) who are causing problems in our story are actually Juan II's first cousins - they're the sons of Ferdinand I of Aragon, who was Henry III's brother.\n\nSo the line of succession if Juan II and his sisters died without heirs would actually potentially go to... the Infantes de Aragón themselves, as they're the male-line descendants of the Trastámara dynasty through Ferdinand I.\n\nBut let me think more carefully:\n\nThe Trastámara line:\n- Henry II of Castile (first Trastámara king)\n\n- John I of Castile (his son)\n- Henry III of Castile (John I's son)\n- Juan II of Castile (Henry III's son)\n\nI see the family's complex succession involves multiple branches. John I had two key sons: Henry III (Juan II's direct line) and Ferdinand \"of Antequera\" (who became the Aragonese royal line). If Juan II's direct descendants perished, the crown would likely pass to Ferdinand's descendants - the Aragonese royal family. However, potential alternative claimants might exist through female lineages or other familial branches.\n\nPotential succession paths reveal intricate political dynamics. Female-line connections through Portuguese royal marriages could introduce additional claims. The hierarchy of succession appears nuanced: first Juan II's potential children, then his sisters' potential offspring, followed by the Aragonese line and possibly Portuguese royalty through female descent. These complex inheritance possibilities represent politically sensitive information that could dramatically impact royal power struggles.\n\nLooking at the question of Castilian succession, you consider the dynastic implications - a king should know these matters well.\n\nThe Line of Succession from Juan II of Castile (1430)\n\nYour Immediate Line:\n\nYou (Juan II, age 18, no children yet)\n\nYour sister María (Queen of Aragon, age 33, married to Alfonso V but childless after 15 years of marriage)\n\nYour sister Catherine (died in 1424, was married to Infante Henry, Duke of Villena - no surviving children)\n\nThe Uncomfortable Truth:\n\nIf you and María die without heirs, the succession becomes complicated and extremely uncomfortable:\n\nThe next legitimate male-line heirs would be... the Infantes de Aragón themselves.\n\nHere's why: Your grandfather, John I of Castile, had two sons:\n\nHenry III (your father, died 1406)\n\nFerdinand \"of Antequera\" (who became Ferdinand I of Aragon in 1412)\n\nFerdinand I's sons are:\n\nAlfonso V (current King of Aragon, married to your sister)\n\nInfante Juan (King of Navarre, the one you just tried to arrest)\n\nInfante Enrique (the other one you tried to arrest)\n\nInfante Pedro (died 1438)\n\nInfante Sancho (Master of Alcántara)\n\nSo the very men who just rebelled against you are actually your father's first cousins and stand in the line of succession. If you died without heirs, Castile might legally pass to:\n\nAlfonso V of Aragon (as eldest son of Ferdinand I)\n\nInfante Juan of Navarre\n\nInfante Enrique\n\nTheir younger brothers\n\nThe Political Explosion:\n\nThis means:\n\nThe Infantes aren't just rebellious nobles - they have royal blood and distant succession rights\n\nSome nobles might see them as legitimate alternatives if you die young\n\nYour arrest attempt could be seen as trying to eliminate rival claimants\n\nAlfonso V could potentially inherit both Castile and Aragon, uniting the crowns\n\nThis gives the Infantes a \"legitimate\" grievance - you tried to arrest potential heirs to the throne\n\nOther Possible Claimants:\n\nThrough female lines, there might be claims from:\n\nPortuguese royalty (through various Castilian-Portuguese marriages)\n\nDescendants of John of Gaunt (through your grandmother Catherine of Lancaster)\n\nOther Trastámara female-line descendants\n\nBut the strongest claim would be the Aragonese line.\n\nYour Strategic Vulnerability:\n\nAs you stand in your Barcelona chambers considering this, the full weight hits you:\n\nYou're 18 with no wife or children\n\nYou're about to embark on a dangerous crusade\n\nThe men with the best claim to succeed you are the ones you just tried to arrest\n\nEvery month you remain unmarried and childless strengthens their position\n\nIf you die in battle against Granada, Castile likely becomes part of Aragon\n\nFray Hernando, if consulted, might observe: \"Perhaps God preserved you from your feelings for Isabel for a reason. You need a political marriage that produces heirs quickly. Every day without an heir is a day the Infantes grow stronger.\"\n\nThis knowledge makes your upcoming confrontation with the Infantes even more delicate. They know what you now fully realize - they're not just nobles to be arrested. They're potential kings of Castile.\n\nWhat do you wish to do with this uncomfortable realization?",

Historically, Alfonso V died without legitimate children.\n\nThe succession for the Crown of Aragon if Alfonso V and his brothers all died without heirs:\n\n1. Alfonso V - no children despite being married since 1415\n2. Infante Juan of Navarre - has a son, Carlos, Prince of Viana (age 9 in 1430)\n3. Infante Enrique - might have children?\n4. Infante Sancho - Master of Alcántara\n5. Infante Pedro - died historically in 1438\n\nWait, I established in the story that Infante Juan has a son, Carlos (age 9), the Prince of Viana. So if we're talking about all of them dying without heirs, we need to go further back.\n\nIf the entire male line of Ferdinand I of Aragon dies out, we need to look at:\n- Female lines from Ferdinand I\n- Going back to earlier Aragonese succession\n\nActually, this gets very complex. The Crown of Aragon had different succession laws than Castile. Let me think about what Juan would realistically know and what would happen.\n\nIf all of Ferdinand I's sons and grandsons died, the succession would be extremely disputed. There would be:\n- Female-line descendants of Ferdinand I\n- Claims from other branches of the House of Barcelona/Aragon\n- Possibly claims from Castile through María (Juan's sister, Alfonso's wife)\n- Claims from other royal houses\n\nThis is getting very hypothetical and Juan is clearly thinking about something here...\n\nYou lean back in your chair, mind racing through the dynastic implications. A hypothetical question, but kings must think in hypotheticals.\n\nThe Aragonese Succession Question\n\nCurrent Line of Succession for Aragon:\n\nAlfonso V (age 34, childless after 15 years of marriage to your sister María)\n\nInfante Juan of Navarre (has a son: Carlos, Prince of Viana, age 9)\n\nInfante Enrique (no legitimate children known)\n\nInfante Sancho (Master of Alcántara, no children)\n\nInfante Pedro (still alive, no significant offspring)\n\nSo currently, if Alfonso V dies, the crown passes to Infante Juan, then to young Carlos of Viana.\n\nBut If They All Died Without Heirs...\n\nThe succession becomes incredibly murky. Ferdinand I (their father) took the Aragonese throne through the Compromise of Caspe in 1412, but he was himself a Castilian prince. If his entire line fails...\n\nPotential Claimants Would Include:\n\nYour sister María - As Alfonso V's widow, she might claim the throne in her own right (Aragon has had ruling queens before, like Petronilla)\n\nYou yourself - Through your sister's marriage and as grandson of Catherine of Lancaster, you'd have a claim\n\nThe House of Urgell - They contested Ferdinand I's succession in 1412. James II, Count of Urgell, fought a war over it. His descendants might revive their claim.\n\nVarious Catalan noble houses - Who trace descent from earlier kings of Aragon\n\nEven France might assert some ancient claim through old marriages\n\nThe Strategic Implications:\n\nAs this thought experiment unfolds in your mind, several realizations dawn:\n\nIf the male Aragonese line died out:\n\nYour sister María could potentially become Queen of Aragon in her own right\n\nYou could press a claim through her\n\nCastile and Aragon might unite under your house, not theirs\n\nThe Crown of Aragon includes Naples, Sicily, Sardinia, Valencia, Catalonia - vast territories\n\nThe Uncomfortable Mirror:\n\nJust as the Infantes stand to inherit Castile if you die without heirs...\n\nYou could potentially inherit Aragon if they all died without heirs\n\nBoth kingdoms' successions are precariously intertwined\n\nBoth sides have incentive to ensure the other doesn't produce heirs\n\nWhy This Matters Now:\n\nSir Thomas, if present, might observe: \"Your Majesty, purely hypothetically... if something happened to all the Aragonese princes during, say, a dangerous military campaign like a crusade, and your sister survived as Alfonso's widow...\"\n\nFray Hernando would immediately interject: \"That line of thinking leads to dark places, Your Majesty.\"\n\nBut the political reality is clear:\n\nThe Infantes aren't just your rivals - they're blocking your potential inheritance of Aragon\n\nYou're not just their rival - you're blocking their potential inheritance of Castile\n\nYour sister María sits at the center of both succession questions\n\nEvery major noble in both kingdoms knows this\n\nThe Current Wild Card:\n\nYoung Carlos, Prince of Viana (age 9) - Infante Juan's son. He's the only child in the next generation on either side. If he survives to adulthood, he could inherit:\n\nNavarre (from his father)\n\nPotentially Aragon (if Alfonso dies childless)\n\nPotentially Castile (if you die childless)\n\nUnless you have children. Soon.\n\nThe Dangerous Game:\n\nThis succession tangle means:\n\nEvery military campaign carries dynastic implications\n\nEvery marriage negotiation affects both kingdoms\n\nEvery feast, every hunt, every voyage risks changing everything\n\nThe Infantes' rebellion wasn't just about power - it was about positioning for potential inheritance\n\nYour arrest order looked like trying to eliminate rival heirs\n\nAs you consider this in Barcelona - in Alfonso V's own city, surrounded by Aragonese nobles who all understand these implications - you realize everyone is watching you very, very carefully.\n\n\"Purely hypothetical,\" you might say aloud. But Diego, your secretary, would know to burn any papers with these calculations. Some hypotheticals are too dangerous to commit to writing.\n\nWhat would you like to do with these dynastic insights?",

You've captured something I felt once but could never put into words.\" She looks up at you. \"That feeling of loving someone you cannot have, of trying to transform earthly desire into something spiritual and eternal.\"\n\nShe carefully folds the parchment. \"You say you don't want to burden her with your love, yet you write 'my love for you' - addressing her directly.

Since the tea, she's been quieter than normal. Her mother says she's been reading that book of poetry you gave her constantly. She asked me once, very carefully, whether you were well. When I said you were busy with crusade preparations, she just nodded and changed the subject.\"\n\n\"I think she understands more than you know. Young women often do.\" María touches your cheek gently. \"I'll watch her. If I believe seeing this would bring her peace rather than pain, if I think it would help her understand rather than torture her with what cannot be... then perhaps. But not now. Not when you're leaving. That would be cruel.\"\n\nShe embraces you tightly. \"You're doing a brave thing, hermano. Letting her go. Letting her live her life unburdened by the love of a king who cannot choose her. But this poem... it shows your heart hasn't let go. Maybe it never will.\"\n\nDrawing back, she asks quietly, \"Do you want my honest opinion? Not as your sister, but as a woman who understands something of impossible love?\"\n\nHow do you respond?",

This is a tender moment between siblings where María can give him her genuine perspective as a woman who has experienced similar heartbreak.\n\nMaría takes a breath, choosing her words carefully.\n\n\"The poem is beautiful, Juan. But it's also... selfish.\" She holds up her hand before you can protest. \"Not intentionally. But look at what you've written. You speak of setting her free, yet you write directly to her - 'my love for you.' You say you place your love in God's kingdom where it's pure, but you also say you don't fear death because it will bring you closer to your love for her.\"\n\nShe sits down, gesturing for you to sit beside her. \"You're trying to have it both ways, hermano. You want to nobly release her while also declaring eternal, spiritual love. You want her to be free while also being forever yours in some heavenly realm.\"\n\nMaría's voice grows gentler. \"I understand the impulse. When I lost my young knight, I told myself similar things. That our love existed somewhere pure and eternal, untouchable by politics or duty. It was the only way I could bear it.\"\n\nShe takes your hand. \"But here's what I learned: That kind of thinking is a beautiful prison. For both of you. You're not truly letting her go - you're transforming your love into something she can never escape, even if she wanted to. If she sees this poem, she'll carry it forever. Every time she looks at stars, she'll think of being your 'bright star.' Every prayer, she'll wonder about that pure love in God's kingdom waiting for her.\"\n\nMaría squeezes your hand. \"Is that kind? Is that the mercy you spoke of in your crusade oaths? Or is it asking her to be forever haunted by a love that exists only in poetry and heaven?\"\n\nShe stands and walks to the window overlooking Barcelona. \"You want my honest opinion? If you truly love her, let her forget you. Let her meet someone who can actually hold her hand, marry her, give her children and a real life. Don't transform her into an eternal symbol of impossible love.\"\n\nTurning back to you, her expression is sympathetic but firm. \"The poem is beautiful, Juan. Your feelings are real and profound. But sometimes the greatest act of love is to leave no trace of it at all. To let the other person be completely, truly free.\"\n\nShe returns to the wooden box. \"I'll keep the poem. But I don't think I'll ever show it to her. Not because it isn't beautiful, but because it is. Because she deserves the chance to heal and move on without the weight of being forever your 'bright star' - close enough to see but too far to touch.\"\n\nMaría embraces you again. \"I'm sorry if that's not what you wanted to hear. But you asked for honesty from someone who understands impossible love. This is what I've learned: The kindest thing is often the hardest - to love someone enough to let them forget you entirely.\"\n\nShe pulls back to look at your face. \"Can you do that, Juan?

I know how much it hurts.\"\n\nShe doesn't try to stop your tears or offer empty comfort. She just holds you, letting you grieve for the love you're truly letting go. The ashes settle in the grate - no trace left of your beautiful, dangerous words.\n\n\"The pain means it was real,\" she whispers after a long moment. \"And burning the poem... Juan, that was the most unselfish thing you could have done. You're not just letting her go in words now, but in truth.\"\n\nShe rocks you slightly, as mothers do with hurt children. \"She hasn't hurt you by any cruelty, has she? She's hurt you simply by existing, by being someone you cannot have. That's the sharpest pain there is - when no one is to blame but fate itself.\"\n\nMaría pulls back enough to wipe your tears with her sleeve, not caring that it stains the fine fabric. \"You're so young to learn this lesson. But you're learning it with such grace. Father would be proud of the man you're becoming - not the king with the crusade and the glory, but this man who can burn a love poem to spare a girl's heart.\"\n\nShe cups your face in her hands. \"The hurt will fade, hermano. Not quickly, not completely, but it will become bearable. One day you'll be able to think of her green eyes without this sharp pain. One day you might even be grateful for having felt something so profound, even if you couldn't keep it.\"\n\n\"But today, you're allowed to grieve. Here, with me, where no one else can see. Let it out, all of it.\"\n\nShe holds you close again. \"And know this - Isabel may have hurt you without meaning to, but you've chosen not to hurt her in return. That's not the choice of a selfish boy. That's the choice of a good man. A true king.\"\n\nThe ashes are completely cold now, nothing but gray dust that could have been anything - a letter, a ledger, a love poem that will never be read.\n\n\"When you're ready,\" María says softly, \"we'll wash your face, and you'll go to your ships, and you'll sail to Seville.

The journey from Barcelona to Seville, while requiring passage through the Strait of Gibraltar, is a regular trade route.\n\nGiven the planning, multiple ships, and the fact that this is a relatively routine voyage (though with precious cargo), I'd say this is \"Likely to succeed\" - not guaranteed, but the precautions taken should be sufficient for a safe journey under normal circumstances.\n\nLooking at your planned voyage from Barcelona to Seville with three ships, let me assess the probability of success.\n\nProbability Assessment: Likely to succeed\n\nFactors in Your Favor:\n\nStrong Security Measures:\n\nThree ships traveling together - mutual defense capability\n\n62 trained crusaders plus experienced guards\n\nRodrigo, García, Sir Thomas commanding security\n\nFour dedicated guards on permanent rotation for the relics\n\nShips can support each other if one has trouble\n\nGood Timing & Conditions:\n\nMid-September: generally favorable sailing weather in the Western Mediterranean\n\nWell-traveled trade route from Barcelona around to Seville\n\nExperienced Catalan captains who know these waters\n\nThe grape harvest season means heavy merchant traffic to blend with\n\nElement of Discretion:\n\nWhile three ships are noticeable, they're not flying royal banners\n\nCould appear as normal merchant convoy\n\nGranada's naval forces likely concentrated near their own waters\n\nNo indication your specific departure date is known to enemies\n\nPotential Dangers:\n\nMaritime Risks:\n\nThe Strait of Gibraltar is always dangerous - currents, winds, and narrow passage\n\nCorsair activity possible, especially North African raiders\n\nSeptember can bring sudden storms in the Mediterranean\n\nThree ships must stay together, slowing to pace of slowest vessel\n\nEnemy Intelligence:\n\nThe Infantes know you're in Barcelona (their agents watched)\n\nGranada has 20-25 war galleys from Muslim allies\n\nYour valuable cargo would be an incredible prize if identified\n\nSome pirates might take three ships as challenge rather than deterrent\n\nPolitical Complications:\n\nMust pass through waters near Granada's influence\n\nAragonese ships might be tracking your departure\n\nNews travels fast along the coast\n\nAssessment:\n\nYour precautions are sound. Three ships with trained fighters and experienced guards should handle normal maritime threats. The route, while long, is regularly traveled. Your security measures for the relics are excellent. The main vulnerabilities are the Strait of Gibraltar passage and the possibility of concentrated enemy action if your identity is discovered.\n\nHowever, unless you encounter a major Granada naval squadron or severe weather, your force should reach Seville successfully.\n\nPlease roll your dice to determine the outcome of your voyage.",

      "text": "The Voyage to Seville\n\nSeptember 18-28, 1430\n\nDeparture from Barcelona (September 18, Dawn)\n\nThe three galleys waited at Barcelona's main quay as morning mist rolled off the Mediterranean. You'd hired experienced Catalan captains:\n\nSanta Eulalia (flagship) - Captain Ramon Berenguer, 40 oars\n\nSant Jordi - Captain Pere Marquet, 35 oars\n\nMare de Déu - Captain Arnau Sabater, 35 oars\n\nYour crusaders boarded in good order. The weeks of training showed - they moved like soldiers now, not the ragged volunteers who'd arrived. Their white tabards with red crosses caught the early sunlight.\n\nMaría came to see you off, accompanied by several nobles from the Consell Reial. She embraced you formally, then whispered: \"The ashes are gone, hermano. Let the wind take the rest of your grief.\"\n\nAs the Santa Eulalia pulled away from the quay, you stood at the stern watching Barcelona recede. Somewhere in that city, Isabel was probably just waking. You turned your face to the sea.\n\nThe First Days (September 18-20)\n\nThe three ships maintained close formation, never more than a quarter-mile apart. Captain Berenguer proved excellent - he'd clearly managed convoy escort before.\n\nYour crusaders adapted to shipboard life with varying success. The former mercenary Marco barely noticed the ship's roll. Pietro vomited for two days straight but kept trying to stand watch. Brother Guillem led prayers at dawn and dusk, his clear voice carrying across the water to the other ships.\n\nOn the second evening, Captain Berenguer pointed to distant sails. \"Fishing boats, Your Majesty. But see how they're not actually fishing? They're watching. By tomorrow, every port from here to Valencia will know three ships passed south in formation.\"\n\n\"Is that a problem?\"\n\n\"Not necessarily. But we're not invisible.\"\n\nThe Challenge at Valencia (September 21)\n\nValencia's harbor authorities tried to insist you anchor for \"inspection.\" Three war galleys emerged to encourage compliance.\n\nCaptain Berenguer looked to you. \"We can outrun them, but it would confirm we're carrying something valuable. Or we can bluff.\"\n\nYou chose to bluff. Standing visible on deck in your white garments (but not displaying the banner), you had Berenguer signal: \"Crusaders bound for Seville under papal authority. Interference with holy mission carries excommunication.\"\n\nThe Valencian galleys held position for a tense hour. Your crusaders lined the rails, hands on weapons but not drawn. Finally, the Valencian commander signaled: \"Pass in peace. God speed your holy work.\"\n\nAs Valencia fell behind, Sir Thomas observed: \"That commander will still report three ships of crusaders heading south. Word will reach Granada before we do.\"\n\nThe Corsair Encounter (September 23)\n\nOff the coast near Cartagena, two sleek vessels emerged from a hidden cove - Barbary corsairs, swift and predatory. They'd clearly been tracking you since dawn.\n\n\"They're testing us,\" Captain Berenguer said. \"Seeing if we'll scatter.\"\n\nThe corsairs swept closer, within crossbow range. You could see their crews - a mix of Berbers, renegade Christians, and sub-Saharan Africans. Professional pirates.\n\nYou made a decision. \"Unfurl the banner. Let them see what they're considering attacking.\"\n\nWhen the white silk unfurled with the golden reliquary of the True Cross gleaming in the sunlight, an extraordinary thing happened. Several of the corsair crew visibly stepped back. You heard arguing on their deck. Their captain - a gray-bearded Berber - stood at his bow staring at the banner for a long moment.\n\nThen he raised his hand in what might have been salute or acknowledgment, and both corsair vessels sheared off, disappearing southward.\n\nFray Hernando murmured: \"Even pirates fear God sometimes. Or perhaps they fear the consequences of attacking a ship bearing the True Cross.\"\n\n\"Or,\" Rodrigo added pragmatically, \"they decided three ships full of armed crusaders wasn't worth the cost.\"\n\nThe Strait of Gibraltar (September 25)\n\nThe most dangerous part of your voyage. The narrow passage between Christendom and Islam, where Atlantic meets Mediterranean, where currents can smash ships against rocks and where Granada's allies waited.\n\nFive Moroccan war galleys patrolled the southern approach.\n\nCaptain Berenguer gathered the three captains. \"We can wait for night, try to slip through in darkness. Or we run the strait in daylight, counting on speed and formation.\"\n\nYou chose daylight. \"We're not smugglers. We're crusaders under papal authority.\"\n\nThe run through the strait was harrowing. The Moroccan galleys shadowed you the entire way, maintaining perfect position to intercept if you tried to land on the African coast. Your crusaders stood to arms for six straight hours. The banner remained visible, relics gleaming.\n\nAt the narrowest point, one Moroccan galley surged forward as if to ram, then veered off at the last moment - a test of nerve. Your formation held.\n\nAs you entered the Atlantic, the Moroccan squadron fell back. They'd delivered their message: We're watching. We're ready.\n\nThe Atlantic Coast (September 26-27)\n\nThe weather turned rough as you sailed north along the Atlantic coast toward Seville. Not a full storm, but heavy seas that had your landlubber crusaders groaning in misery.\n\nPietro, green-faced but determined, asked: \"Your Majesty, how do you stand it?\"\n\n\"I think about where we're going,\" you replied. \"Each wave brings us closer to Seville. Closer to the Council. Closer to beginning God's work.\"\n\nDuring the worst of the weather, you found Giovanni the blacksmith at the rail, not seasick but praying steadily. \"For safe voyage?\" you asked.\n\n\"No, Your Majesty. Thanking God for the storm.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because if He sends storms, it means He's watching. He hasn't forgotten us.\"\n\nSimple faith, but it moved you.\n\nArrival at Seville (September 28, Afternoon)\n\nThe Guadalquivir River's mouth appeared through morning haze. Your three ships turned upriver, oars beating steadily against the current.\n\nAs you approached Seville, the city's bells began ringing - not alarm, but welcome. Word had preceded you. Crowds gathered along the riverbanks. Your crusaders stood straighter, white tabards bright despite the voyage.\n\nThen you saw him: Álvaro de Luna waited at the main dock with a small honor guard. His face was carefully composed, but you knew him well enough to see the relief.\n\nAs the Santa Eulalia tied up, Álvaro called out: \"Your Majesty! Thanks be to God for your safe return.\"\n\nYou stepped onto the dock - Castilian soil after five months away. Álvaro dropped to one knee formally, then rose and embraced you, whispering urgently: \"We must talk immediately. The Infantes refused arrest. They're fortified and defiant. The realm holds, but barely. And there's more - Granada's embassy arrived three days ago. They're waiting to see you.\"\n\nBehind Álvaro, you noticed several richly dressed Moors watching from a balcony. The Granadan delegation, studying their future opponent.\n\nYou nodded to Álvaro but kept your voice carrying: \"We have returned with God's blessing and the Pope's commission. Let all of Seville know - the King is home, and the crusade shall begin!\"\n\nThe crowd erupted in cheers. Your 62 crusaders disembarked in formation, their disciplined appearance causing murmurs of approval. When Rodrigo and García brought the banner-chest containing the relics, people dropped to their knees.\n\nBut even as you waved to the crowd, Álvaro's urgent expression told you everything: You'd returned not to a united kingdom ready for crusade, but to a realm on the edge of civil war.\n\nYour successful voyage is complete. You've arrived in Seville with:\n\nAll 62 crusaders safe and accounted for\n\nThe sacred relics and papal bull secure\n\nYour military equipment and treasury intact\n\nYour reputation enhanced by the disciplined arrival\n\nFive weeks until the November 8 Royal Council\n\nBut the challenges awaiting you are severe:\n\nThe Infantes remain free and defiant\n\nGranada's embassy is here with an offer\n\nThe nobility questions your authority\n\nCivil war threatens\n\nWhat is your first action upon landing in Seville?",

This makes sense - he needs to understand the full situation before making any diplomatic moves. He's being cautious about security too, wanting a safe location for the discussion.\n\nLet me describe Álvaro taking Juan to a secure location and briefing him on the situation in detail.\n\nÁlvaro nods sharply, immediately understanding. \"Diego,\" he calls to your secretary, \"Send word to the Granadan delegation that His Majesty acknowledges their presence and will grant them audience once he has attended to urgent matters of state. They've waited three days; a few more hours won't matter.\"\n\nHe turns to Rodrigo. \"Captain, secure the relics in the cathedral treasury. Four guards at all times. Nobody touches them without His Majesty's direct presence.\"\n\n\"Sir Thomas,\" Álvaro continues, \"see to quartering the crusaders. The Alcázar's outer barracks are prepared.\"\n\nThen quietly to you: \"Come. We'll go to the Torre del Oro. It's secure, and we won't be overheard.\"\n\nThe Torre del Oro - Secure Conference\n\nThe Tower of Gold, Seville's famous defensive tower by the river, has a chamber at its top used for the most sensitive discussions. Álvaro has posted his most trusted men at every level. Only the two of you stand in the circular room, windows showing the Guadalquivir below.\n\nÁlvaro pours wine from a flask he brought himself - taking no chances with poison. His face, now that you're alone, shows the strain of the past months.\n\n\"Juan,\" he says, dropping formality. \"Thank God you're back. First, the good - you should know what you achieved. The papal bull is already legend. Cardinal Orsini wrote to the Archbishop of Toledo describing your... presentation to the Pope. The story has spread everywhere. Half of Castile thinks you're a living saint. The other half thinks you're mad, but even they're impressed by the audacity.\"\n\nHe drinks deeply. \"Now the bad. The Infantes didn't just refuse arrest - they've been actively building a coalition against you. They claim the arrest order was forged by me, that you're either dead, imprisoned, or lost in religious mania. About eight noble houses believe them. Another thirty are waiting to see proof you're actually in command.\"\n\nÁlvaro moves to a map on the table. \"Here's where we stand militarily.\" He points to various positions:\n\n\"The Infantes control:\n\nArévalo fortress\n\nTwo minor castles here and here\n\nTheir own estates, heavily fortified\n\nAbout 5,000 troops total\n\nMaster of Santiago supports them with another 2,000\n\nWe control:\n\nAll major cities\n\nThe royal administration\n\nAbout 3,000 royal troops\n\nThe loyalty of about 15-20 noble houses who could raise maybe 8,000 more\n\nMasters of Calatrava and Alcántara remain neutral but lean toward us\n\nThe problem: If we move against the Infantes militarily, it's civil war. Alfonso V has already threatened to intervene from Aragon if his brothers are harmed. We'd win eventually, but the cost...\"\n\nHe pauses, then adds grimly: \"And that's before we consider Granada. Juan, their delegation isn't just here to negotiate. They arrived with disturbing news. The Sultan has received massive support from across the Muslim world - Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt, even the Ottomans. They have gold, troops, and ships we didn't expect. Our spies report at least 20,000 troops gathering in Granada, with modern Ottoman cannon.\"\n\nÁlvaro refills his cup. \"The Granadan ambassador, Abu Abdullah al-Zaghal, is clever. He's been very visible in Seville, visiting churches, speaking with merchants, being conspicuously peaceful. He's brought gifts worth a fortune. The message is clear: Granada wants peace and is strong enough to enforce it.\"\n\nHe looks at you directly. \"The November 8 Council is ten days away. Every major noble will attend - including the Infantes, who claim they're coming to 'protect the realm from false orders.' If you appear weak, if the kingdom looks divided, the crusade dies before it begins. Worse, we might face civil war.\"\n\n\"But,\" Álvaro adds with a slight smile, \"you have advantages they don't expect. The papal bull is real and spectacular. The True Cross and Santiago's bone - nobody can argue with those. Your 62 crusaders made an impression arriving in formation. And most importantly, you're here, alive, clearly in command. That alone destroys half the Infantes' arguments.\"\n\nHe leans against the window. \"So, my king, my friend - what's our strategy? Do we:\n\nTry to reconcile with the Infantes before the Council? Offer them something to stand down?\n\nPrepare for confrontation at the Council? Use the papal authority to override their political maneuvering?\n\nDeal with Granada first? If we could secure peace or alliance there, it would free us to handle the Infantes?\n\nSomething else entirely?\n\nThe realm needs you to be brilliant, Juan. What the Pope gave you is powerful, but it's not enough by itself. How do we turn this situation to our advantage?\"\n\nÁlvaro waits, watching you with the keen intelligence that has kept him alive through decades of court intrigue. Below, the Guadalquivir flows toward the sea, and somewhere in the city, Granadan diplomats and the Infantes' agents are making their own plans.\n\nWhat is your strategic decision?",

      "text": "Juan is asking whether it's public knowledge that the Infantes were ordered to surrender themselves for trial. This is important for understanding the political situation and how the arrest order has been perceived.\n\nBased on the narrative so far:\n- Álvaro made a public summons on September 5th in Valladolid's main square\n- Heralds proclaimed that the Infantes were summoned to present themselves to royal justice\n- The proclamation was copied and sent to every major city in Castile\n- The Infantes publicly responded on September 7th, denying charges and refusing to surrender to Álvaro\n- They sent copies of their response to major noble houses, the Archbishop, and Alfonso V\n\nSo yes, it's very much public knowledge that they were ordered to surrender and refused.\n\nÁlvaro nods grimly. \"Oh yes, it's known. I made sure of that. On September 5th, I had heralds proclaim the summons in Valladolid's main square and sent copies to every major city. The charges were explicit - rebellion, seizure of royal property, conspiracy against the crown. They had ten days to surrender themselves peacefully.\"\n\nHe pulls out a document from his pouch. \"And here's where they made a mistake. They responded publicly, in writing. Listen to this part: 'We question the legitimacy of orders issued in the King's absence and demand to see His Majesty personally before submitting to any proceedings. We will not surrender ourselves to Don Álvaro de Luna, whom we consider party to this conflict rather than neutral arbiter.'\"\n\nÁlvaro sets the document down. \"They sent copies to every noble house, the Archbishop of Toledo, even Alfonso V in Naples. So yes, everyone knows they were ordered to appear for trial and refused. They've tried to spin it as refusing to submit to me rather than to you, but the fact remains - they defied a royal summons.\"\n\nHe leans forward. \"This is actually one of our advantages, Juan. They're in open defiance of royal justice. They can claim the orders were illegitimate, but now you're here. You can confirm the orders were real. That makes them rebels who refused legitimate royal summons. Even their supporters will have difficulty arguing against that.\"\n\n\"The question is how to use this. Some of the neutral nobles are disturbed that the Infantes refused to even appear for trial. As several have said privately - if they were innocent, why not come and defend themselves? Their refusal makes them look guilty, even to those who might sympathize with their complaints about me.\"\n\nÁlvaro's eyes sharpen. \"If you publicly confirm at the Council that you personally ordered their arrest, that you stand behind the charges, it puts them in a difficult position. They either submit to trial or confirm themselves as rebels before the entire realm. But it also risks pushing them to desperate action.\"\n\n\"What do you think? Should we use their public refusal against them?\"",

Why would they be allowed to come to the Royal Council? Let me think through the practical and political realities here.\n\n1. The Infantes have military forces - they're not just walking around unprotected. They likely travel with armed retinues.\n\n2. They're princes of Aragon - arresting them could trigger war with Aragon\n\n3. They've claimed they'll come to the Council to \"protect the realm\" - so they're positioning themselves as coming to participate, not as rebels\n\n4. The practical reality of medieval justice - you need force to arrest someone with their own army\n\n5. The political question - attempting to arrest them at the Council could turn the Council into a battlefield\n\nThis is a good strategic question from Juan - why give them legitimacy by letting them attend?\n\nÁlvaro's expression shifts - surprise, then consideration, then a slow nod of respect.\n\n\"Christ's blood, you're right. Every moment we don't arrest them, we legitimize them.\" He starts pacing. \"If a common lord refused royal summons, we'd have men hunting him across Castile. But the Infantes? We let them move freely, gather support, even come to the Royal Council?\"\n\nHe stops at the window. \"Here's the ugly truth: They have 5,000 troops. When they travel, they move with at least 500 armed men. To arrest them 'on sight' means attacking their escort. That's a battle, not an arrest. Blood in the streets of Seville if they come here.\"\n\n\"But you're raising a crucial point,\" Álvaro continues, turning back. \"If we let them walk into the Royal Council as if they're legitimate participants rather than fugitives from justice... we've already lost. Every noble will see that royal summons can be ignored if you have enough swords.\"\n\nHe thinks intensely. \"What if... what if we make the arrest warrant public here in Seville, today? You personally, visibly, confirm the orders. Anyone who aids or shelters them is guilty of harboring rebels. Then:\n\nIf they come to the Council, they must come under flag of truce to surrender themselves\n\nIf they come armed and defiant, they mark themselves as rebels before everyone\n\nIf they don't come, they've abandoned any claim to legitimacy\n\nWe could send heralds today to every approaching road: 'The Infantes de Aragón are commanded to surrender themselves to royal justice. Any who enter Seville must do so unarmed and prepared to answer charges.'\"\n\nÁlvaro's eyes gleam. \"It's aggressive. It might provoke them. But you're right - every day we treat them as princes rather than rebels, we weaken royal authority. What do you command?\"",

Juan would need to consider this carefully.\n\nÁlvaro nods approvingly. \"Yes, your personal confirmation would make it undeniable. We'll gather the nobles tonight - most are already here for the Council anyway.\"\n\nThen his expression turns grave at your second question. \"The punishment for rebellion... technically it's death, Juan. Treason against the crown is a capital crime. But...\"\n\nHe walks to the map again, staring at it. \"These aren't ordinary nobles. They're Infantes of Aragon, royal blood. Alfonso V's brothers. If we execute them, it means war with Aragon, possibly Navarre too. No question.\"\n\n\"Historically, when dealing with rebellious royal princes, kings have chosen alternatives:\n\nExile - Banishment from Castile permanently\n\nLoss of all Castilian titles and lands - Strip them of everything they hold from you\n\nImprisonment - Usually in comfortable but secure confinement\n\nForced religious life - Making them take holy orders, enter a monastery\n\nMassive fines - Bankrupt them but leave them alive\n\nOr combinations thereof.\"\n\nÁlvaro turns to you. \"If I may be frank? The smartest punishment would be: Strip them of all Castilian lands and titles, exile them permanently, and let them keep their lives and Aragonese holdings. They become Alfonso's problem, not ours. We look merciful but firm.\"\n\n\"But if you want to make an example...\" he pauses. \"Imprisonment until they publicly swear loyalty and renounce all claims to influence in Castile. Then exile. It shows strength without forcing Alfonso to invade to save his brothers' lives.\"\n\n\"The key is this - whatever you threaten must be something you're willing to actually do. If you threaten death but everyone knows you won't follow through, you look weak. If you threaten exile and they call your bluff, you must be ready to enforce it.\"\n\n\"What sounds right to you?

You can simply confirm they must answer charges of rebellion, and let them wonder what that might mean.\"\n\nÁlvaro adds: \"Shall I summon the nobles for this evening?

This would be like the King of France trying to force an English prince to renounce his rights to the English throne - no legal authority\n\nThis is actually a very astute observation from Juan, recognizing the long-term dynastic threat. Álvaro would understand this immediately but also recognize the impossibility.\n\nÁlvaro's eyes widen, then he shakes his head slowly. \"Christ, you see it too. If Alfonso dies without heir - and after fifteen years of marriage to your sister, that seems likely - Infante Juan inherits Aragon. Then we face not just a hostile noble but a hostile king on our border.\"\n\nHe pours more wine, thinking hard. \"But here's the problem: You're King of Castile, not Aragon. You have no authority over Aragonese succession. It would be like Alfonso trying to make you renounce your claim to Castile. Even if they signed such a renunciation under duress, it would be meaningless. The Cortes of Aragon wouldn't recognize it. The Pope wouldn't enforce it. Alfonso would declare it void immediately.\"\n\n\"The only ways to permanently remove their threat are...\" Álvaro pauses, clearly uncomfortable. \"Death. Imprisonment for life. Or...\"\n\nHe stops, then continues carefully. \"Or force them into religious orders. A monk cannot inherit a crown. If they took holy vows, genuine ones before bishops, they'd be removed from succession. But forcing that would still likely mean war with Alfonso.\"\n\nÁlvaro walks to the window again. \"There's another angle. Your sister María. She's Alfonso's queen.

Right now, we can only deal with their Castilian rebellion. We can't solve the Aragonese succession problem through this trial.\"\n\nHe turns back to you. \"Unless... Juan, what if we offered them a choice? Full pardon and keep their Castilian lands if they voluntarily take religious vows? Frame it as mercy - letting them serve God rather than face execution for treason? It would remove them from both Castilian politics and Aragonese succession.\"\n\n\"Though I doubt they'd accept.

We congratulate you on receiving the blessing of your Holy Father. Yet we come to remind you that Granada has been home to Muslims, Christians, and Jews for seven centuries. Many arrangements are possible between men of wisdom.\"\n\nHe pauses, choosing his words carefully. \"My Sultan offers this: Double the current tribute, from 50,000 to 100,000 gold dinars annually. Free passage for Christian merchants in our lands. The return of all Christian captives currently held - some 300 souls. Permission for Christian priests to minister to Christians living in Granada. All this, in exchange for continued peace.\"\n\n\"Furthermore,\" his voice takes on a slightly harder edge, \"the Sultan wishes Your Majesty to know that Granada does not stand alone. The Dar al-Islam - the house of Islam - has awakened to our situation. Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt, even the mighty Ottomans have pledged their support. What might have been an easy conquest a year ago would now be a long, bloody war.\"\n\n\"Yet war serves neither of our peoples. The farmers need peace to tend their fields. The merchants need peace for trade. Mothers need peace to raise their children - both Christian and Muslim mothers weep the same tears for dead sons.\"\n\nHe gestures to the illuminated Quran. \"That holy book, which I know Your Majesty will not read, speaks of Jesus - whom we call Isa - as a great prophet. It speaks of Mary - Maryam - with reverence. We are not the pagans your ancestors fought. We worship the God of Abraham, as do you.\"\n\n\"My Sultan proposes this: Let us sign a treaty of twenty years' peace.

But know this - we also take back word of a young king who treated us with courtesy, who walked from his throne to shake a Muslim's hand, who promises protection for converts rather than slaughter.\"\n\n\"That is... unexpected. And it will be remembered.\"\n\nAl-Zaghal bows again. \"Your Majesty, I suspect we will meet again, though next time it may be across a battlefield rather than a throne room. I pray that when that day comes, we both remember this moment - when two men of different faiths spoke honestly and parted without hatred.\"\n\nHe turns to go, then pauses. \"One thing more. The internal troubles of Castile are known to us. Some in Granada counsel that we should attack while you face the Infantes. But my Sultan is honorable. We will not strike while you settle your house. But once you march south with that banner, once you cross our frontier - then we will fight with everything we have.\"\n\n\"Go with your God, Juan of Castile. You will need Him.\"\n\nThe delegation withdraws in perfect order, taking their gifts. As the doors close behind them, the throne room erupts in discussion.\n\nThe Archbishop of Toledo approaches the throne. \"Your Majesty... that was remarkably handled. Firm but not insulting. Though I confess, shaking his hand...\"\n\nSeveral younger nobles are energized, talking of crusade and glory. Others look thoughtful - al-Zaghal's warnings about Granada's strength clearly registered.\n\nÁlvaro appears at your elbow. \"Well done. You showed strength without giving them cause for immediate war. And his promise not to attack during our internal troubles - that's valuable time.\"\n\nHe lowers his voice. \"The nobles are assembled for tonight. After what they just witnessed, confirming the arrest order for the Infantes will seem like the natural next step in asserting your authority. Shall we proceed?\"\n\nFray Hernando has been silent throughout, but now speaks quietly: \"That man would have been a valuable Christian. But forced conversion is no conversion at all. You did right to let him leave in peace.\"\n\nWhat's your next action?",

About to confirm arrest orders publicly to nobles\n\nThe chapter covers approximately August 28 - September 28, 1430, focusing on Juan's final time in Barcelona, the journey to Seville, and initial confrontations upon return.\n\nChapter 6: Return to a Kingdom Divided\n\nAugust 28 - September 28, 1430\n\nSummary of Events\n\nThe Isabel Resolution (August 28, Barcelona)\n\nJuan's romantic crisis regarding Isabel Ruiz, the converso merchant's daughter, came to a head. After writing a poem declaring eternal spiritual love for her, his sister María challenged him on the selfishness of such a gesture. Recognizing that burdening Isabel with the knowledge of his impossible love would be cruel rather than noble, Juan burned the poem and truly let her go - his first genuine sacrifice of personal desire for another's wellbeing.\n\nFinal Preparations in Barcelona (August 28)\n\nBefore departing, Juan:\n\nConfirmed a three-week stay to complete crusader training\n\nOrganized payment system for crusaders (2 maravedís/day, 200 maravedí bonus)\n\nCommissioned equipment: white tabards with red crosses (evoking Templars)\n\nCreated clasp system for crusader identification\n\nSecured 82,000 florins in donations from Barcelona elite\n\nKey Decision: Sent Captain Fernán racing to Castile with orders for Álvaro to arrest the Infantes for rebellion\n\nThe Journey to Seville (September 18-28)\n\nThe Fleet: Three galleys hired for security\n\nSanta Eulalia (flagship with Juan and relics)\n\nSant Jordi\n\nMare de Déu\n\nNotable Events:\n\nSuccessfully bluffed past Valencia's inspection\n\nCorsair encounter -

true love means letting go\n\nCertainty and Humility: Juan's \"divine certainty\" proved wrong, teaching him to question even his strongest convictions\n\nFaith and Realpolitik: Managing papal mandate while navigating political impossibilities\n\nThe Cost of Leadership: Every decision carries multiple consequences; nothing is simple\n\nBuilding vs. Destroying: Easier to create enemies than allies; Juan building coalition while avoiding civil war\n\nLooking Forward\n\nThe chapter ends with Juan about to address Seville's nobles to confirm the arrest warrant. The November 8 Royal Council looms where all conflicts will converge:\n\nWill the Infantes submit or fight?\n\nCan Juan unite the nobility behind the crusade?\n\nHow will Granada's unexpected strength affect noble support?\n\nCan civil war be avoided while maintaining royal authority?\n\nThe young king has returned with papal blessing but faces the hardest test yet: turning a divided kingdom into an instrument of divine will capable of completing the Reconquista.",
