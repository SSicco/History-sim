Bianca has just shown her rose-colored dress with gold embroidery she helped create. Household cheering for her. A moment of family joy and Bianca's emotional healing.\n\nLet me write the chapter introduction picking up exactly where Chapter 2.51 ended.\n\nChapter 2.52\n\nSpring 1440, Late Morning\n\nThe great hall of the Alcázar echoes with applause—not the formal acclamation of court ceremony, but something warmer: the spontaneous cheering of household servants, the delighted clapping of children, the quiet pride of a family gathered around its youngest member. Bianca stands in the center of it all, five years old and radiant in rose-colored wool embroidered with gold thread—stitches she placed herself, her small fingers guided by Marta the seamstress.\n\nLucia sits nearby, one hand pressed to her heart, eyes bright with a mother's relief. Beside her, Catalina applauds with genuine enthusiasm while Fernando watches his half-sister with the solemn attention he gives all court proceedings. Teresa and Juana bounce on their nurse's lap, Nicolás squirming to see what has caused such excitement. Ser Benedetto, the Florentine tailor who allowed Bianca to help embroider her own dress, stands with professional satisfaction at his work—and perhaps something more, witnessing the girl's transformation from troubled child to this moment of quiet triumph.\n\nDon Álvaro de Luna catches your eye across the hall, and in his gaze you see the same recognition: not merely a dress, but a crisis averted, a daughter reclaimed from whatever dark place a roll of two on a die had threatened to send her.\n\nThe cheering subsides into warm murmurs. Bianca looks to you, her father the King, still seeking that final confirmation that she belongs—that she is loved—that the story you told her on horseback through Toledo's streets was true.",

      "text": "**Late Summer 1439** — Conceives August/September 1439. Child due Spring 1440. Moderate wait, Lucia regains confidence gradually.\n\nThis means Lucia won't conceive until late summer 1439, so there's a period of waiting after the miscarriage. The child would be due around Spring 1440 (May/June if conceived in August/September).\n\nThis is a moderate outcome - not the quickest recovery, but not problematic either. It suggests Lucia's body and spirit needed more time to recover from the December 1438 miscarriage than her previous rapid conceptions might have suggested.\n\nI should note this outcome and then ask what else the player wants to determine before we properly start the chapter.\n\nRoll: 27 — Late Summer 1439\n\nLucia conceives in August or September 1439. The child will be due in late Spring 1440 (May/June).\n\nAfter six pregnancies in rapid succession and the emotional blow of December's loss, her body needed time. The winter was difficult—not just grief, but the quiet anxiety of wondering if something had changed. Spring passes without news. Summer brings warmth but still no quickening.\n\nIt won't be until the harvest season that Lucia will feel the familiar signs again. By then, the wait will have tested her confidence, though she'll never speak of it directly. When she finally tells Juan—perhaps in late September or early October 1439—the relief in her eyes will say what her words do not.\n\nFor now, in Spring 1439, this uncertainty is simply part of the household's unspoken concerns.\n\nRecorded:\n\nLucia conceives: August/September 1439\n\nChild due: May/June 1440\n\nCurrent state (Spring 1439): Not yet pregnant, recovering emotionally from miscarriage\n\nYou mentioned there were a few things to determine.

This is historically appropriate - medieval kings did travel their realms to show themselves to their subjects and to personally oversee their lands. But it's also logistically complex with small children.\n\nLucia would have opinions about this. She's sharp-tongued, politically astute, and direct. She would consider:\n1. The political benefits of being seen\n2. The practical challenges with young children\n3. Her own health situation (she doesn't know she'll conceive in August/September)\n4. Which children are old enough to travel well\n\nI should write Lucia's response in character - she's Italian, educated, direct, and would engage with this practically. She wouldn't just agree or disagree but would discuss the merits and challenges.\n\nI need to STOP after Lucia speaks and let the player respond. Short response, dialogue-focused.\n\nChapter 2.52\n\nSpring 1439, Late Morning\n\nThe celebration has quieted. The household staff have returned to their duties, the children dispersed to the nursery under Doña Beatriz's watchful eye—all except Bianca, who lingers by her mother's side, reluctant to let go of the morning's triumph. Lucia strokes her daughter's dark hair absently, her grey-green eyes thoughtful as she considers your question.\n\n\"A progress,\" she says, testing the word. \"It has been... how long since a King of Castile showed himself beyond Toledo and the war camps? Your father never did, I think. The nobles came to him.\"\n\nShe gestures for Bianca to go join her siblings, and the girl—still radiant in her rose-colored dress—obeys with only a small reluctant glance backward.\n\nOnce the door closes, Lucia speaks more freely.\n\n\"The people should see you. And the children—especially Fernando. He is five, nearly six. Old enough to sit a horse beside his father and be seen as heir. Catalina too. Her voice alone would win hearts in every cathedral from here to Santiago.\" She pauses, her lips quirking. \"Though whether she would deign to perform on command is another question.\"\n\nShe rises, moving to the window that overlooks the courtyard below.\n\n\"But all of us? Nicolás is barely walking. Juana and Teresa would need to travel by carriage, and carriages mean slow progress, frequent stops, the risk of illness on the road. And I—\" She hesitates, her hand brushing her stomach in a gesture that has become habit over six pregnancies. \"I am not with child. Not yet. But if we travel through summer and autumn...\"\n\nShe turns back to face you.\n\n\"What is your purpose, mi rey? To be seen as a family, united and fruitful? Or to show Fernando to the great cities as their future king? The answer shapes which of us should go, and where.\"",

She's also a devoted mother. Let me think about how she'd respond:\n\n1. She would consider the children's ages and needs\n2. She would think practically about what's best\n3. She might have her own feelings about being left behind\n4. She's not one to be overly sentimental but she's also honest\n\nThe younger children:\n- Teresa (3) - thrives, spirited, healthy\n- Juana (2) - magnetic, will have mysterious illness later but currently healthy\n- Nicolás (1) - barely walking, robust\n\nAt these ages, 2-3 months away from their father would likely not have lasting impact, especially if Lucia is there. Children this young are primarily attached to their primary caregivers, and Lucia is clearly very present.\n\nBut there's also the question of whether Lucia herself wants to stay behind or might feel excluded. She's been Juan's partner in everything - attending council meetings, traveling to Constantinople with him. Being left in Toledo while he travels might not sit well with her, even if it's practical.\n\nLet me write Lucia's response - she should be thoughtful, practical, but also perhaps show a hint of her own feelings about being separated.\n\nLucia is quiet for a moment, her fingers tracing the carved stone of the windowsill.\n\n\"Nicolás will not remember you were gone,\" she says practically. \"He is one. He knows his wet nurse better than he knows either of us—that is simply how it is with infants. Teresa is sturdy and content; she will miss you, but she will not suffer. Juana...\"\n\nShe pauses, considering the two-year-old with the magnetic presence.\n\n\"Juana notices everything. She will ask where Papá has gone. Every day, probably. But she will survive it.\" A small smile. \"She is already learning that the world does not arrange itself around her desires, much as she believes it should.\"\n\nLucia turns from the window and crosses back toward you, her expression shifting to something more complex.\n\n\"Two or three months will not harm the little ones. Children are resilient—more than we give them credit for. And Doña Beatriz is capable. The household runs itself.\"\n\nShe stops before you, close enough that you can see the fine lines at the corners of her eyes—lines that were not there when she arrived in Toledo five years ago.\n\n\"But I confess, mi rey, I did not expect to be the one left behind.\" Her tone is light, but there is something beneath it. \"I have grown accustomed to being at your side—in council, on campaign, even on that wretched ship to Constantinople. Now I am to wave from the walls while you show our children to the realm?\"\n\nShe holds up a hand before you can respond.\n\n\"I am not complaining. I understand the logic. Someone must remain with the young ones, and it cannot be you. I simply...\" She exhales. \"I will miss you. That is all.\"",

The truce holds until 1445. You would break it?\" She shakes her head slightly, not in denial but in calculation. \"Or Morocco—the campaign you have been planning, Tétouan, the corsair ports? Or something else entirely?\"\n\nHer hands have folded in her lap, very controlled.\n\n\"I am not saying no, Juan. I learned long ago that you do not make such declarations lightly. You have been building toward something since before I knew you—since Granada, since Constantinople, since you first dreamed of Christian empire.\"\n\nShe rises, slowly, and moves to stand before you.\n\n\"But if you ride out under your white banner, you ride toward men who want to kill you. And I have buried one queen of Castile already.\" Her voice does not waver. \"So before I tell you what I think, I need to understand what you are planning. Not the poetry of it—the reality. Who is the enemy? What is the goal? And what happens to this kingdom—to these children—if you do not come back?\"",

She's heard him talk like this before - the messianic tendencies that his confessor Fray Hernando helps him manage. The statement \"God has more plans for me\" could sound either like genuine faith or like dangerous overconfidence.\n\nShe would likely:\n1. Not simply accept \"I will not die\" - that's not something anyone can promise\n2. Push back on the faith argument - faith doesn't stop arrows\n3. Want to understand the strategic logic, not just the spiritual conviction\n4. Be concerned about succession if he does fall\n5. Perhaps reference Isabel - who also had faith, and died anyway\n\nBut she also knows Juan, loves him, and understands that this is who he is. She won't simply oppose him - she'll engage seriously with the plan.\n\nThe truce expires in 1445, and there's a one-year notice provision. So if he declares in 1440, war could begin in 1441. That's the timeline he's suggesting.\n\nI should have Lucia respond authentically - with love, concern, and the sharp political mind she possesses. She won't just accept platitudes about divine protection.\n\nLucia's expression flickers—something between love and exasperation passing across her features.\n\n\"Faith,\" she repeats. She steps closer, close enough to place her hand flat against your chest, over your heart. \"Isabel had faith, Juan. She prayed every day. She believed God would see her safely through her second childbirth.\"\n\nShe does not look away.\n\n\"I am not saying faith is meaningless. I am saying it is not armor. The Ottomans have faith too—faith that Allah will grant them victory over the infidel kings of the West. When your cavalry meets their sipahis, faith will not turn aside the arrows. Steel will. Strategy will. Numbers will.\"\n\nShe withdraws her hand, but does not step back.\n\n\"You say you will use this year to prepare. Good. Then prepare. Tell me what the plan is—not the dream of Christian empire, but the campaign. How many men? From where? Who commands? What is the objective—Constantinople's defense? Thrace? The Balkans? Do you march overland through lands that barely know your name, or sail with a fleet that must pass through waters the Ottomans control?\"\n\nHer voice has steadied now, shifting from wife to counselor.\n\n\"And yes—who rules if you fall? Fernando is five. Álvaro can serve as regent, but for how long? Until Fernando is fifteen? Twenty? Ten years of regency breeds faction, breeds civil war.

The papal legates might have different instructions.\n\n2. **Council of Basel dynamics** - Juan has been working on parallel legislation and mediating the papal-conciliar crisis. This might affect the Council's role at Arras.\n\n3. **Juan's general European prestige** - As Defensor Romaniae and conqueror of Granada, Juan has significant moral authority in Christendom.\n\n4. **Ottoman threat** - Juan's focus on the Ottoman threat might create pressure for Christian unity.\n\n5. **Alfonso V's position** - Alfonso now controls Naples, shifting Mediterranean power dynamics.\n\n6. **France-Castile relations** - How does Charles VII view Juan? Are they rivals or potential allies?\n\n7. **England's position** - Henry VI is young; regency government. Bedford died in 1435 historically.\n \nJuan's potential involvement is limited, with his influence primarily indirect.

The Council of Basel and papal legates served as mediators. The central questions: Could the Hundred Years' War be ended? Would Burgundy remain allied with England, or reconcile with France?\n\nFactors Favoring Franco-Burgundian Reconciliation:\n\nFrance willing to offer formal apology for the murder of Duke John the Fearless (1419)\n\nPhilip the Good exhausted by decades of war\n\nEngland's regency government (young Henry VI) appears weak\n\nPapal pressure for Christian unity against Ottoman threat\n\nJuan's crusading prestige creates moral pressure for Western peace\n\nFactors Favoring Continued Anglo-Burgundian Alliance:\n\nEnglish wool trade vital to Burgundian economy\n\nPhilip's personal hatred of Charles VII\n\nEnglish military still formidable in Normandy\n\nFear that French reconciliation means French dominance\n\nBurgundian nobles divided on the question\n\nd100: Congress of Arras Outcome\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-5\nComplete Failure — Congress collapses entirely. All parties leave embittered. Fighting intensifies. Burgundy strengthens alliance with England. France isolated.\n6-15\nEnglish Diplomatic Victory — Cardinal Beaufort's delegation succeeds beyond expectations. Burgundy renews alliance with England. France must continue fighting alone. War continues with English advantage.\n16-25\nStalemate — No agreement reached, but no worsening of relations. Status quo preserved. Three-way tension continues. War grinds on inconclusively.\n26-40\nPartial Reconciliation — France and Burgundy agree to a truce but not formal alliance. Burgundy officially neutral. England weakened but not isolated. War continues at reduced intensity.\n41-60\nHistorical Outcome — Treaty of Arras signed. Burgundy reconciles with France. England refuses terms, leaves isolated. Philip the Good formally abandons English alliance. England's position in France begins long decline.\n61-75\nStrong Franco-Burgundian Alliance — Reconciliation more thorough than expected. Philip commits Burgundian forces to French campaigns. English position collapses faster. Normandy under serious pressure by 1439.\n76-85\nComprehensive Peace Initiative — Franco-Burgundian reconciliation accompanied by offers to England. Henry VI's regents seriously consider terms. Possible path to ending Hundred Years' War entirely within decade.\n86-95\nChristian Unity Movement — Congress produces broader agreement. Papal legates invoke Ottoman threat and Juan's crusading example. All three powers agree to truce, with discussions of joint action against infidels.

Double down on England alliance - try to defeat France\n2. Wait and see - maintain status quo, avoid committing\n3. Try again for French reconciliation through back channels\n4. Focus on internal consolidation and expansion in the Low Countries\n5. Look for new opportunities - maybe pivot toward the Empire or other powers\n6.

Cardinal Beaufort's delegation refused any terms that did not acknowledge English claims to the French crown. King Charles demanded full recognition as sole legitimate King of France. Duke Philip sat between them, unwilling to commit either way.\"\n\nÁlvaro strokes his chin. \"So the war continues, but without resolution. England and Burgundy remain allied in name, but the alliance frays. France remains at war with both, but faces no unified front against her.\"\n\nLucia speaks up. \"A stalemate favors no one—but it harms England most. They are fighting across the Channel, far from home, with a child-king and squabbling regents. France fights on her own soil.

He has been allied with England since 1420, bound by hatred of the Dauphin who murdered his father. But the alliance has grown stale. England offers little, demands much, and shows no path to victory. Yet reconciliation with France means swallowing pride and trusting the son of his father's killer.\n\nThe stalemate at Arras leaves Philip with options—but also with uncertainty.\n\nFactors Favoring Aggressive Pro-English Strategy:\n\nPersonal hatred of Charles VII remains\n\nEnglish wool trade vital to Flemish economy\n\nAlliance with winner (if England prevails) means territorial gains\n\nBurgundian nobles in English-held territories prefer status quo\n\nFactors Favoring Reconciliation with France:\n\nWar exhaustion across Burgundian domains\n\nCharles VII's position strengthening yearly\n\nEngland's regency government appears increasingly dysfunctional\n\nPope and Church pressure for Christian unity\n\nFactors Favoring Independent Action:\n\nPhilip's ambitions extend beyond the French quarrel\n\nThe Low Countries offer expansion opportunities\n\nThe Holy Roman Empire is weak and distracted\n\nBurgundy could become a third great power, beholden to neither\n\nd100: Burgundy's Strategic Intent (1435-1439)\n\nRoll\nStrategic Direction\n1-10\nRenewed English Commitment — Philip doubles down on the alliance. Burgundian forces actively support English campaigns. Major offensive planned against Charles VII. Philip believes England can still win.\n11-20\nPassive English Alliance — Philip maintains alliance in name but commits minimal resources. Lets England carry the burden. Preserves options while avoiding risk. Watches and waits.\n21-35\nSecret French Negotiations — While publicly allied with England, Philip opens back-channel talks with Charles VII. Seeks better terms than Arras offered. Plays both sides carefully.\n36-50\nArmed Neutrality — Philip effectively withdraws from the French war without formally breaking with England. Focuses on consolidating his own domains. Neither helps nor hinders either side significantly.\n51-65\nLow Countries Expansion — Philip turns his attention north and east. Acquisition of Luxembourg, pressure on Liège, influence over Utrecht. Building a Burgundian state independent of French quarrels.\n66-75\nImperial Pivot — Philip looks toward the Holy Roman Empire. Seeks elevation—perhaps a royal title, perhaps the imperial crown itself someday. Positions Burgundy as a European power, not merely a French faction.\n76-85\nMediterranean Interest — The Ottoman threat and Juan's crusading prestige catch Philip's attention. Burgundian resources could earn glory and influence in the East. Exploratory contacts with Christian powers fighting the Turks.\n86-95\nDual Strategy — Philip pursues both Low Countries expansion AND secret French negotiations. Ambitious and complex. Seeks to emerge from the stalemate stronger than before, with options in every direction.\n96-100\nThe Burgundian Vision — Philip conceives of a grand design: a Burgundian kingdom stretching from the North Sea to the Alps, independent of both France and the Empire. Every action from 1435-1439 serves this ultimate ambition.\n\nRoll when ready, Sicco. Then we'll determine France and England's intentions before resolving what actually happens.",

Philip the Good is essentially stepping back from the Hundred Years' War to focus on building his own power base in the Low Countries. This leaves England more isolated and France with less pressure from the Burgundian flank.\n\nNow I need to create a table for England's strategic intentions from 1435-1439. England at this time is in a difficult position:\n- Henry VI is a child (born 1421, so 14 in 1435, 18 in 1439)\n- The regency government is divided between the Duke of Bedford (who dies in 1435), Cardinal Beaufort, and Humphrey Duke of Gloucester\n- They hold significant territory in France (Normandy, parts of Maine, English Gascony)\n- But their position is weakening\n- The stalemate at Arras means they didn't get Burgundy to commit more strongly, but also didn't lose them entirely\n\nLet me create a table for England's strategic options.\n\nBurgundy's Intent Noted: Low Countries Expansion\n\nIsaac makes a note. \"Duke Philip looks north and east. Luxembourg, Liège, Utrecht. He builds a Burgundian state—one that need not depend on the outcome of the French war.\"\n\nÁlvaro nods slowly. \"That is... significant. If Philip focuses on the Low Countries, England loses her most powerful ally's active support. The alliance may exist on paper, but Burgundian swords will not be fighting for English claims.\"\n\nEngland After Arras: Strategic Intentions (1435-1439)\n\nContext:\nEngland's position in France has been deteriorating since the death of Henry V in 1422. The infant Henry VI is now fourteen years old (in 1435) but still under regency. John, Duke of Bedford—the architect of English strategy in France—died in September 1435, just weeks after Arras. Cardinal Beaufort and Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester compete for influence over the young king and policy.\n\nEngland holds Normandy, parts of Maine, Calais, and English Gascony in the southwest. But the garrisons are expensive, reinforcements from England are increasingly difficult to raise, and French resistance grows yearly under Charles VII's improving government.\n\nThe stalemate at Arras preserved the Burgundian alliance—but only on paper.\n\nFactors Favoring Aggressive Continuation:\n\nEnglish pride refuses to abandon Henry V's legacy\n\nNormandy has been English for twenty years; many see it as permanently theirs\n\nDuke Humphrey of Gloucester favors war\n\nAdmitting defeat would be politically catastrophic at home\n\nFactors Favoring Negotiated Settlement:\n\nCardinal Beaufort's faction prefers diplomacy\n\nWar is ruinously expensive; Parliament increasingly reluctant to fund it\n\nBedford's death removes the one commander who could manage the French situation\n\nYoung Henry VI shows no martial inclination\n\nFactors Creating Paralysis:\n\nRegency factionalism prevents coherent policy\n\nNo clear succession of military leadership after Bedford\n\nResources insufficient for major offensive, too committed for withdrawal\n\nDomestic troubles brewing (economic strain, noble discontent)\n\nd100: England's Strategic Intent (1435-1439)\n\nRoll\nStrategic Direction\n1-10\nMajor Offensive — Gloucester's faction prevails. England commits to one great campaign to break French resistance. Massive resources marshaled for assault on French-held territory. High risk, high reward.\n11-20\nReinforced Defense — England commits to holding what she has. Normandy and Gascony reinforced. No major offensives, but determined resistance to any French advance. Sustainable but uninspiring.\n21-35\nStrategic Confusion — Factional conflict paralyzes decision-making. Policy shifts erratically between Beaufort's caution and Gloucester's aggression. Commanders in France receive contradictory orders. Drift and decay.\n36-50\nEconomy of Force — Limited resources focused on key strongpoints. Some peripheral positions quietly abandoned. Pragmatic consolidation disguised as strategic patience. Waiting for circumstances to improve.\n51-65\nDiplomatic Probing — Beaufort's influence grows. Secret negotiations with France explored. Terms unacceptable yet, but channels opened. Military posture defensive while diplomacy seeks exit.\n66-75\nBurgundian Pressure — England recognizes Philip's drift and attempts to re-engage him. Diplomatic missions, trade concessions, appeals to old alliance. Trying to pull Burgundy back into active partnership.\n76-85\nDomestic Focus — French war increasingly neglected as regency government deals with problems at home. Garrisons maintained but little direction from London. France becomes secondary concern.\n86-95\nSearch for New Allies — Recognizing Burgundian unreliability, England looks elsewhere. Brittany, the Empire, Aragon, even Castile—anyone who might balance against France. Diplomatic creativity born of desperation.\n96-100\nYoung King's Emergence — Henry VI, approaching adulthood, begins asserting personal influence. His pious, peaceful nature shapes policy toward negotiation. Unexpected opening for resolution—if France is willing.\n\nRoll when ready, Sicco. Then we'll determine France's intentions.",

Now let's create a table for France's strategic intentions.\n\nEngland's Intent Noted: Search for New Allies\n\nIsaac's eyebrows rise slightly. \"England looks beyond Burgundy. Brittany, the Empire, Aragon... perhaps even Castile.\"\n\nLucia glances at you. \"Have we received English envoys?\"\n\n\"Exploratory contacts,\" Isaac confirms. \"Nothing formal. But Cardinal Beaufort's agents have been making inquiries in several courts. They are desperate, Majesty. Desperate men seek friends wherever they can find them.\"\n\nÁlvaro frowns. \"England seeking alliance with Castile while we prepare for crusade against the Ottomans. That is... complicated.\"\n\nFrance After Arras: Strategic Intentions (1435-1439)\n\nContext:\nCharles VII has transformed from the mocked \"King of Bourges\" into an increasingly effective monarch. His government has been reformed, his revenues are growing, and his armies—once ragged bands—now include professional companies and improved artillery. The failure at Arras to secure Burgundian reconciliation was a disappointment, but not a catastrophe.\n\nFrance's position improves yearly. English garrisons are isolated and undersupplied. Burgundy's passive alliance with England means Philip sends no armies against Charles. Time favors France—if Charles is patient.\n\nYet patience has costs. Every year of war means more devastation of French lands, more peasants dead or fled, more towns ruined. And Charles VII is not a young man; he needs victories to secure his dynasty and silence those who still whisper about his legitimacy.\n\nFactors Favoring Major Offensive:\n\nFrench military strength growing; English strength declining\n\nArtillery improvements give France siege advantage\n\nBurgundian passivity means no second front\n\nCharles needs glory to cement his reign\n\nFactors Favoring Patient Consolidation:\n\nTime already favors France; why risk a major defeat?\n\nTreasury still recovering from decades of war\n\nProfessional army still being built\n\nEnglish defensive positions remain strong\n\nFactors Favoring Diplomatic Resolution:\n\nWar exhaustion across all French society\n\nChurch pressure for peace continues\n\nTrade and prosperity require stability\n\nBurgundy might be won over with patience\n\nd100: France's Strategic Intent (1435-1439)\n\nRoll\nStrategic Direction\n1-10\nGrand Offensive — Charles commits everything to driving the English out. Major campaigns in Normandy and Gascony simultaneously. Total war to end the conflict by force.\n11-20\nNormandy Focus — All efforts concentrated on recovering Normandy, the symbolic and strategic heart of English France. Methodical siege warfare, town by town.\n21-35\nOpportunistic Pressure — No grand strategy, but constant probing. Attack where English are weak, retreat where they are strong. Death by a thousand cuts.\n36-50\nMilitary Reform Priority — Charles focuses on building the army that will eventually win. The compagnies d'ordonnance, artillery corps, professional officers. Preparing for future campaigns rather than rushing present ones.\n51-65\nBurgundian Courtship — Primary effort goes to wooing Philip away from England entirely. Diplomatic missions, concessions offered, patience exercised. If Burgundy flips, England is doomed.\n66-75\nSouthern Consolidation — Focus on Gascony and the southwest. English presence there older but more isolated. Secure the south before turning north.\n76-85\nEconomic Warfare — Strangle English garrisons through commerce raiding, trade disruption, and pressure on supply lines. Make the occupation too expensive to maintain.\n86-95\nInternational Legitimacy — Charles seeks recognition and alliances abroad. Papal support, imperial acknowledgment, ties with Iberian powers. Isolate England diplomatically while building French prestige.\n96-100\nThe Pragmatic Peace — Charles, confident of eventual victory, offers surprisingly generous terms to England. Keep Gascony, abandon Normandy. A negotiated end that preserves French strength for other purposes.\n\nRoll when ready, Sicco.

Through diplomatic channels - likely an envoy or ambassador, possibly through intermediaries, or through Isaac de Baeza's intelligence network picking up on the inquiries.\n\nLet me think about when this would make sense:\n- Arras was in August-September 1435\n- Duke of Bedford died September 1435\n- England would need time to recognize Burgundy was drifting away\n- By 1436-1437, they would start looking for alternatives\n- The outreach to Castile would probably come in 1437 or 1438\n\nThe English would likely send a diplomatic mission or at least exploratory contacts. Given Juan's prestige (Defensor Romaniae, conqueror of Granada, supporter of the Pope), England might see him as a valuable ally.\n\nHowever, there's a complication - Juan is preparing for crusade against the Ottomans, and England wanting alliance could be complicated. Also, historically, Castile had ties to France through various treaties and marriages.\n\nI should present this as a scene where the council discusses when and how the English approached, and what they wanted. This could be an interesting diplomatic thread for Juan to consider.\n\nIsaac de Baeza clears his throat.\n\n\"The English reached out twice, Majesty. The first time was informal—late 1436, through a Genoese merchant in Seville who does business with both English Gascony and our ports. He carried a letter from the English seneschal in Bordeaux, inquiring whether Castile might be interested in 'renewed friendship' and 'mutual commercial advantage.'\"\n\nHe produces a small leather folder from his satchel.\n\n\"I intercepted it, assessed it as exploratory, and filed it. You were occupied with the Cortes and Princess Juana's birth. It seemed... not urgent.\"\n\nÁlvaro's expression suggests he would have preferred to know about this, but he says nothing.\n\n\"The second approach was more formal,\" Isaac continues. \"Spring of 1438. An English clerk named Thomas Beckington—a man of Cardinal Beaufort's household—arrived in Burgos claiming to be on pilgrimage to Santiago. He was not subtle. He made inquiries about audiences, about Castilian policy toward France, about Your Majesty's plans.\"\n\nIsaac pauses.\n\n\"I had him watched but not obstructed. He completed his 'pilgrimage' and departed through Gascony. My agents report he carried letters back to London, though we do not know their contents.\"\n\nLucia frowns. \"So England knows you are wealthy, powerful, and uncommitted to France. And they know you have not rejected their overtures outright—because you never received them.\"\n\nShe looks at Isaac with something between admiration and wariness.\n\n\"Does Cardinal Beaufort believe Juan is considering alliance? Or does he believe he is being ignored?\"\n\nIsaac tilts his head. \"Uncertain, Majesty. But I would expect a third approach—more formal, harder to overlook—within the year. They are running out of friends.\"\n\nHe turns to you.\n\n\"Do you wish to receive such an envoy if one comes? Or shall I ensure they remain... lost on pilgrimage?\"",

He walks with the careful dignity of a man who knows he is being assessed.\n\nHe kneels before your throne with practiced grace.\n\n\"Your Most Christian Majesty,\" he says in creditable Latin, \"I bring greetings from my master Henry, by the Grace of God King of England and France, and from His Eminence Cardinal Beaufort, who serves as the young king's most devoted counselor.\"\n\nHe rises when you gesture permission, and his eyes sweep the hall—noting Álvaro at your right hand, Lucia at your left, the assembled nobles and clergy. Taking measure.\n\n\"I confess I came to your realm as a pilgrim, seeking the blessings of Saint James. But my master the Cardinal instructed me that if opportunity arose, I should convey to Your Majesty the sincere desire of England for friendship with Castile.\" He pauses. \"Our realms have not always been friends. But neither have we been enemies for many years. And in these troubled times, Cardinal Beaufort believes that Christian princes should seek accord rather than discord.\"\n\nHe folds his hands, waiting.",

Historically, Henry VI married Margaret of Anjou in 1445, so in 1438 he was not yet married.\n\nThis is an interesting diplomatic probe from Juan - he's essentially asking if a marriage alliance between one of his daughters and the King of England might be possible. His eldest daughters are:\n- Catalina (born January 1432) - would be about 6 years old in 1438\n- Bianca (born September 1434) - would be about 3-4 years old in 1438\n\nSo any marriage would be years away, but betrothals at young ages were common in medieval diplomacy.\n\nBeckington would likely be very interested in this line of inquiry, as a marriage alliance between Henry VI and a daughter of Juan II would be a significant diplomatic coup for England.\n\nBeckington's composure cracks—just for an instant.

Juan cannot command their armies directly. Alfonso might support Juan's endeavors, but he has his own concerns and his own health issues (the roll indicated he has 8-12 years to live with accumulating damage).\n\nÁlvaro should point this out - that these are Alfonso's forces to command, not Juan's.

Alfonso keeps a household guard of perhaps two thousand men-at-arms.\"\n\n\"Naples,\" Álvaro continues, \"is larger but more troubled. On paper, the feudal levy could produce twenty thousand men. In practice, the Neapolitan barons are fractious, their loyalty to Alfonso still fresh and uncertain. Perhaps ten to twelve thousand could be relied upon for an offensive campaign beyond Italy's borders.\"\n\n\"Sicily adds another five to eight thousand, mostly light infantry and crossbowmen. Good for defense of the island, less useful for campaigns in France.\"\n\nHe turns to you directly.\n\n\"If—and it is a significant if—King Alfonso committed fully to a war against France alongside Castile, the combined Trastámara realms might field seventy thousand men or more. But Alfonso's attention is divided, his health reportedly poor, and his ambitions lie in Italy, not France.\"",

He has not sent armies to fight alongside us in years. Whether he would welcome a partition of France or resist it...\" Beckington spreads his hands. \"That is a question Cardinal Beaufort must consider carefully.\"\n\nHe straightens, and his tone becomes more formal.\n\n\"I will depart for England within the fortnight, with Your Majesty's leave. Cardinal Beaufort will wish to deliberate. Such matters cannot be rushed—but neither, I think, will they be ignored.\"\n\nHe hesitates, then adds:\n\n\"The Princess Catalina. Might I... would Your Majesty permit me to convey something of her nature and qualities to my master? A physical description would be indelicate to request, but her accomplishments, her education, her... character? It would help Cardinal Beaufort understand the value of what Castile might offer.\"",

Catalina would be the star - she can sing, she's brilliant, she's commanding. This would be a powerful diplomatic moment.\n\nI should narrate Beckington arriving at the family residence (Casa de las Palomas perhaps, or the Alcázar), meeting the children, and particularly being impressed by Catalina. Her voice would be the standout moment.\n\nI need to be careful not to write Juan's dialogue or actions - just set up the scene and have Beckington respond to what he sees.\n\nThat Evening\n\nCasa de las Palomas, Outside Toledo\n\nThe English clerk arrives as the sun begins its descent, escorted by two of Isaac's men who have been shadowing him since his arrival in Castile. He has changed from his pilgrim's robes into something more befitting an audience—a dark wool doublet of English cut, modest but well-made. He carries a small leather satchel.\n\nLucia receives him in the courtyard, every inch the Queen of Castile despite the informal setting. She speaks to him in Italian-accented Latin, inquiring about his journey, the state of the roads, whether his lodgings in Toledo are adequate. Beckington responds with practiced courtesy, but his eyes keep drifting toward the sounds of children's voices from within the house.\n\nWhen you join them, Lucia has already put the Englishman at ease—or as much at ease as a foreign envoy can be in a king's home.\n\n\"My husband keeps an informal household here,\" she explains as she leads you both inside. \"The children are more themselves at Casa de las Palomas than in the Alcázar. You will see them as they truly are, Master Beckington. For better or worse.\"\n\nThe main hall is warm, lit by candles and a low fire. Doña Beatriz sits in a corner with the youngest children—Teresa on her lap, Juana toddling nearby, the infant Nicolás asleep in a cradle. Fernando stands by the window, attempting to look dignified despite his four years. And Catalina...\n\nCatalina sits on a cushioned bench, a book open before her, ignoring everyone with the imperious disinterest of a child who knows she is about to be displayed.\n\nBeckington stops in the doorway, taking it all in.",

Her Latin is flawless, her accent crisp. \"An island kingdom beyond France. Their king claims the French throne but cannot hold it. They make wool and tin. Their saint is George, who slew a dragon, though dragons are not real.\" She tilts her head. \"Their weather is gray and it rains constantly. The food is very bad.\"\n\nLucia suppresses something that might be a cough.\n\nCatalina continues, unperturbed. \"They were our enemies once, when they attacked our ships.

She's brilliant, she might pick up on it. But she's also only 6, so there are limits.\n\nLet me write Beckington's reaction and Catalina's response naturally.\n\nCatalina considers this with the gravity of a theologian weighing doctrine.\n\n\"The French,\" she says. \"They also claim to be the Most Christian Kingdom.

Fernando has lost interest and wandered back toward the window.\n\n\"I shall depart within the week, with Your Majesty's leave.\"\n\nEngland's Reaction to First Contact\n\nContext:\nThomas Beckington returns to England in early summer 1438 with remarkable news: Castile is open to alliance. King Juan II has immense wealth, commands vast armies across multiple crowns, and has a daughter of extraordinary qualities. But his price is high—nothing less than a share of France herself.\n\nCardinal Beaufort must navigate the treacherous waters of English politics. His rival Humphrey of Gloucester opposes any diplomacy that smells of compromise. Young Henry VI grows more influential daily, and his pious nature inclines toward peace. Parliament controls the purse strings and has grown weary of endless war.\n\nFactors Favoring Enthusiastic Pursuit:\n\nCastile offers genuine strategic transformation\n\nPrincess Catalina sounds ideal—intelligent, composed, royal\n\nBeaufort's faction seeks diplomatic solutions\n\nBurgundy's drift makes new allies essential\n\nJuan's wealth could subsidize English campaigns\n\nFactors Against:\n\nJuan's territorial demands are breathtaking\n\nSharing France with Castile wounds English pride\n\nGloucester will oppose anything Beaufort proposes\n\nBurgundy's reaction is unpredictable\n\nParliament may refuse to fund expanded war\n\nThe Pope may condemn partition of a Christian kingdom\n\nComplicating Factors:\n\nHenry VI's personal inclinations increasingly matter\n\nOther marriage candidates exist (French, Imperial)\n\nEnglish domestic troubles demand attention\n\nTime pressure—delay risks losing the opportunity\n\nd100: English Reaction to Beckington's Report (Summer 1438)\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-5\nHostile Rejection — Gloucester's faction seizes on the report as evidence of Castilian arrogance. Demands for French territory denounced as insulting. Beaufort humiliated. Door to alliance slams shut. England pursues other options.\n6-15\nCold Dismissal — Council judges Juan's terms impossible. Polite response sent thanking Castile for the audience, but no follow-up embassy. Matter quietly dropped. Beaufort's influence diminished.\n16-25\nSkeptical Delay — Council divided. Beaufort argues for continued engagement; Gloucester mocks the idea. Decision deferred indefinitely. No formal embassy sent, but door left slightly open.\n26-40\nCautious Interest — Council intrigued but wary. Small diplomatic mission sent to maintain contact, but without authority to discuss substance. England wishes to learn more before committing. Slow progress.\n41-55\nFormal Engagement — Beaufort prevails. Formal embassy dispatched to Toledo with authority to negotiate commercial treaty and explore \"matters of mutual interest.\" Marriage discussed obliquely. Real but measured progress.\n56-70\nEager Pursuit — Council recognizes opportunity. Senior embassy sent with instructions to move quickly. Commercial treaty and betrothal discussions authorized. Territorial questions deferred but not rejected. Momentum building.\n71-80\nStrategic Embrace — Beaufort triumphant. England commits to pursuing Castilian alliance as primary diplomatic objective. High-ranking embassy with broad powers. Betrothal negotiations priority. Territorial arrangements to be discussed seriously.\n81-90\nRoyal Interest — Young Henry VI personally engaged by reports of Princess Catalina. His influence pushes council toward enthusiastic pursuit. Embassy includes personal letter from Henry to Juan. Unusual warmth and urgency.\n91-95\nGrand Alliance Vision — England sees partition of France as genuine possibility. Secret approaches to Burgundy to gauge Philip's reaction. Comprehensive diplomatic initiative launched. Beaufort given extraordinary authority to negotiate.\n96-100\nTransformative Opportunity — Henry VI, approaching his majority, declares Castilian alliance his personal priority. Council united behind pursuit. Embassy of highest rank dispatched immediately. England ready to discuss all terms seriously, including territorial partition.\n\nRoll when ready, Sicco.",

He thanks you for receiving Master Beckington so graciously. He expresses admiration for the Princess Catalina's reported qualities.\"\n\nIsaac's tone is carefully neutral.\n\n\"But he sends no embassy. He proposes no treaty. He makes no mention of territorial arrangements.\"\n\nÁlvaro grunts. \"They are interested but afraid to commit. The English council is divided.\"\n\n\"That is my assessment as well,\" Isaac confirms. \"Beaufort wishes to pursue the matter, but he lacks the authority—or the political strength—to do so openly. Gloucester's faction mocks any diplomacy that does not involve English victories on the battlefield.\"\n\nHe gestures to the letter.\n\n\"The Cardinal does make one concrete proposal. He suggests that 'informal communications' continue through 'trusted intermediaries.' He names a Gascon merchant, one Guillaume de Soulac, who trades in Bilbao and Bordeaux. Letters could pass through this man without attracting notice.\"\n\nLucia frowns. \"Back-channel correspondence. Beaufort wants to keep talking without anyone in England knowing he is talking.\"\n\n\"Precisely, Your Majesty.\"\n\nIsaac turns to you.\n\n\"I have maintained contact with this Guillaume de Soulac. He is real—a wine merchant of moderate wealth and no political importance. The perfect cover. If you wish, the channel remains open.\"\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\"But I should note: this is not how a king negotiates a marriage for his daughter. This is how a cardinal hedges his bets while waiting to see which way the wind blows.\"",

By expressing \"disappointment\" and placing the burden on England to \"move forward,\" he signals that Castile will not chase this alliance. The ball is firmly in England's court.\n\nCardinal Beaufort receives this message through the Guillaume de Soulac channel in late Spring 1439. He must decide how to respond. Juan's tone suggests the window may be closing—but committing more openly risks Gloucester's faction exposing and sabotaging the negotiations.\n\nMeanwhile, the war in France grinds on. English positions weaken slowly but perceptibly. Burgundy remains passive. And now Castile—the one power that might transform England's fortunes—sounds ready to walk away.\n\nFactors Favoring Stronger Commitment:\n\nFear of losing the opportunity entirely\n\nEngland's strategic position continues to deteriorate\n\nBeaufort needs a success to maintain influence\n\nJuan's wealth and armies remain desperately attractive\n\nPrincess Catalina reportedly exceptional\n\nFactors Favoring Continued Hesitation:\n\nJuan's territorial demands still seem impossibly ambitious\n\nGloucester will attack any commitment Beaufort makes\n\nParliament unlikely to fund expanded war\n\nEnglish pride wounded by Juan's cool tone\n\nUncertainty about Burgundy's reaction\n\nComplicating Factors:\n\nHenry VI growing into his own opinions\n\nFrench pressure on Normandy increasing\n\nTime working against England generally\n\nOther potential marriage candidates still exist\n\nd100: English Response to Juan's Message (Summer/Autumn 1439)\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-5\nSilence — No response at all. Beaufort, stung by the tone or overruled by rivals, lets the correspondence die. The Guillaume de Soulac channel goes cold. England has chosen a different path.\n6-15\nWounded Withdrawal — A brief, formal response expressing regret that Castile found England's friendship insufficient. Thinly veiled offense at Juan's \"disappointment.\" Channel remains technically open but effectively frozen.\n16-25\nEmpty Courtesies — A warm letter full of renewed assurances of friendship but containing nothing concrete. More words, no action. Beaufort stalling while he manages internal politics. Frustrating ambiguity continues.\n26-40\nModest Proposal — Beaufort proposes a commercial treaty as a first step. Trade agreements, merchant privileges, naval cooperation against pirates. Marriage and territorial questions explicitly deferred to \"future discussions.\" Small but real progress.\n41-55\nEnvoy Announced — England will send a formal diplomatic mission to Toledo. Not the senior embassy Juan might hope for, but legitimate representatives with authority to discuss \"matters of mutual benefit.\" Arrival expected late 1439 or early 1440.\n56-70\nAccelerated Engagement — Juan's cool tone has the intended effect. Beaufort, fearing the opportunity slipping away, dispatches a more senior mission with broader authority. Commercial treaty AND preliminary marriage discussions authorized. Real momentum.\n71-80\nBeaufort's Gamble — The Cardinal decides to force the issue. A high-ranking embassy sent with authority to negotiate betrothal terms. Beaufort betting his political future on the Castilian alliance. Gloucester furious but outmaneuvered—for now.\n81-90\nRoyal Intervention — Henry VI, now seventeen and increasingly assertive, takes personal interest. His letter accompanies the diplomatic response, expressing his own desire for friendship with Castile and curiosity about Princess Catalina. The young king's involvement changes the political calculus.\n91-95\nComprehensive Offer — England proposes formal negotiations on all fronts: commercial treaty, military cooperation, AND marriage alliance. Territorial questions to be discussed \"with open minds.\" A significant embassy already being assembled. England finally serious.\n96-100\nDesperate Embrace — A crisis in France (military setback, Burgundian defection, or domestic upheaval) transforms English calculations. Castilian alliance suddenly seen as essential, not merely desirable. England ready to discuss everything—including territorial partition.\n\nRoll when ready, Sicco.

He holds the County of Burgundy—the Franche-Comté—as a vassal of the Holy Roman Emperor. And he holds Flanders, Brabant, Holland, Hainaut, and a dozen other territories under various titles and claims.\"\n\nHis finger traces the patchwork of lands.\n\n\"He is richer than most kings. He commands more soldiers than most kings. His court at Bruges outshines Paris and rivals any in Christendom. And yet...\" Álvaro pauses. \"He is not a king. He is a duke. A count. A collection of titles without a crown.\"\n\nIsaac de Baeza speaks up from his corner.\n\n\"My contacts in Bruges suggest this rankles him deeply, Majesty. Philip founded the Order of the Golden Fleece—an order of chivalry to rival any in Europe. He builds palaces. He patronizes artists. He holds himself like a sovereign. But when the King of France summons him, he is technically obliged to kneel.\"\n\n\"Which he has not done in twenty years,\" Lucia adds dryly.\n\n\"Precisely.\" Isaac nods. \"The question of what Philip wants is one my agents have pondered for years. Some believe he seeks a royal crown—a 'Kingdom of Burgundy' or 'Kingdom of Frisia' that would unite his territories under sovereign rule. Others believe he aims higher still.\"\n\n\"The Imperial throne,\" Álvaro says quietly. \"Emperor Sigismund is dead. The Habsburgs hold the crown now, but weakly. Philip has Imperial fiefs. Philip has wealth. Philip has ambition.\"\n\nHe turns back to you.\n\n\"As for France—yes, Majesty, he must fear it. Charles VII grows stronger each year. If France wins her war with England decisively, what then? A victorious French king will not tolerate a Burgundian state that defies him. Philip knows this. It is why he has not fully committed to either side.\"\n\nLucia folds her hands.\n\n\"So we offer him what he cannot obtain from France or England: recognition. Respect. Perhaps... support for his ambitions, whatever they may be.\" She pauses. \"But your instinct is correct, husband. We must feel out these matters, not state them plainly. If our envoy marches into Bruges and asks 'Do you wish to be a king?', Philip will take offense. Such things must be... discovered through conversation. Through careful listening.\"\n\nÁlvaro nods.\n\n\"The envoy must be subtle. Intelligent. Capable of reading what is not said as much as what is. And highborn enough that Philip does not feel insulted by receiving him.\"\n\nHe gestures toward the door again.\n\n\"I have summoned three candidates, Majesty. Shall I bring them in so you may judge for yourself?\"",

A younger, ambitious noble - perhaps less experienced but clever\n\nI should present them with their characteristics and let the player choose. I should also remember that Juan wants to:\n1. Feel out Philip's position on his own ambitions (kingship? empire?)\n2. See if he fears French subjugation\n3. Explore what cooperation with Castile is possible\n4. Sound out what aid Philip might give against the Ottomans\n\nLet me create three distinct candidates with different strengths.\n\nThe Three Candidates\n\nÁlvaro opens the door and gestures. Three men enter the chamber and kneel before you.\n\nDon Íñigo López de Mendoza, Count of Manzanares\n\nThe first to rise is a man you know well—poet, soldier, scholar, and one of the great lords of Castile. He is perhaps fifty-five now, his dark hair streaked with grey, but his eyes remain sharp. He served as ambassador to the papal court in his younger years and led your marriage delegation to Ferrara to negotiate for Lucia.\n\n\"Majesty,\" he says simply, his voice cultured and measured.\n\nÁlvaro speaks quietly at your shoulder. \"Don Íñigo has the rank to impress any court in Europe. He speaks French fluently, knows Latin and Italian, and has read more books than most monasteries possess. Philip would recognize him as an equal. But...\" He hesitates. \"He is also proud. Perhaps too proud. He may speak when he should listen.\"\n\nDon Alonso de Cartagena, Bishop of Burgos\n\nThe second man is older—sixty or more—with the tonsure of a cleric and the bearing of a prince of the Church. He was born Pablo de Santa María, son of the great Jewish convert Solomon ha-Levi, and has served Castile as diplomat for three decades. He represented your father at the Council of Basel and is said to have debated the finest theologians in Christendom to a standstill.\n\n\"Your Majesty.\" His bow is precise, formal.\n\n\"The Bishop is the finest diplomat in Castile,\" Álvaro murmurs. \"Perhaps in all of Spain. He knows the ways of courts, the language of negotiation, the art of discovering what men truly want. And as a churchman, he can speak of crusade without it seeming self-interested.\" A pause. \"But Philip is... not always comfortable with conversos. The Flemish can be particular about such matters. It may color the reception.\"\n\nDon Fadrique Enríquez de Mendoza\n\nThe third man is younger—perhaps thirty—and carries himself with the easy confidence of high birth and higher ambition. He is the Admiral of Castile's nephew, connected by blood to half the great houses of the realm. He has traveled extensively—Italy, the Empire, even Constantinople with your expedition in 1434—and speaks multiple languages with facility.\n\n\"Majesty.\" His bow is graceful, his smile charming.\n\n\"Young Don Fadrique is clever, observant, and extremely good at making people like him,\" Álvaro says. \"He would not intimidate Philip—which may be an advantage. Men speak more freely to those they do not perceive as threats. But he lacks experience in serious negotiation, and some may see his youth as a slight.\"\n\nAll three men stand before you, waiting.\n\n\"These are your choices, Majesty,\" Álvaro concludes. \"A great lord, a wise bishop, or a charming young noble. Each carries advantages and risks. The mission you describe—feeling out Philip's ambitions without giving offense, exploring cooperation, raising the matter of crusade—requires particular skill. Choose carefully.\"",

Castille is able to support either side in the hundred years war and can throw in theory it's full weight into it. These are just exploratory talks so be careful. A royal marriage is possible, you know about my children, but I do not know about the Burgundian family and marriage situation. Feel this out.\n\n\nStrategically, it is in our interest to have the French kingdom divided over different realms. Better have multiple rulers on our northern border than one. We have already fought them in Naples. A united France is a possible threat. We support a Burgundian kingdom.\n\n\nAlso, you should start with my fight against the Ottomans. This is maybe an easy and uniting subject. Bring him my admiration and regards to his valour and his order of the golden fleece. Fighting for christianity is clearly something we both feel passionately about. Can we march together against the Sultan?\n\n\nDo you have questions before I send you on your way?",

He has clearly been listening carefully.\n\n\"I am honored by Your Majesty's trust.\"\n\nHe pauses, gathering his thoughts.\n\n\"I have several questions, Majesty, if you will permit me.\"\n\nHe counts on his fingers as he speaks.\n\n\"First—the matter of precedence. If Duke Philip raises the question of the Hundred Years' War directly and asks where Castile stands, how far may I go? May I hint that Castile might favor Burgundian independence, or must I remain entirely neutral in my language? The Duke is said to be skilled at reading between words. He will sense any preference I carry, even if I do not speak it.\"\n\nHe moves to his second point.\n\n\"Second—the crusade. You wish me to invite Duke Philip to march against the Ottomans. If he expresses interest, am I authorized to discuss specifics? Numbers of men, contribution of ships, timing of campaigns? Or do I merely gauge his enthusiasm and report back?\"\n\nA third finger rises.\n\n\"Third—the marriage question. I know Your Majesty has four daughters and two sons. Do you have... preferences? If Duke Philip has sons or nephews of suitable age, do I speak of the Princesses generally, or is there one you would wish me to present as particularly suitable? The Princess Catalina is eldest and most renowned, but she is also—forgive me—already mentioned in connection with England.\"\n\nHe hesitates before his final question.\n\n\"Fourth—and I ask this with delicacy—what is my authority if Duke Philip proposes something unexpected? Something beyond the scope of my instructions? Do I listen and report, or may I express provisional interest on Your Majesty's behalf?\"",

Discretion, exploration, and an open hand. I will not commit you to anything, but I will ensure Duke Philip understands that Castile sees him as he wishes to be seen—a sovereign in all but name, and perhaps soon in name as well.\"\n\nHe accepts the documents Álvaro provides—copies of the muster rolls, the division of titles from the Constantinople arrangements, letters of introduction sealed with your personal seal.\n\n\"I shall depart within the week. With fair roads and God's blessing, I should reach Bruges within a month.\"\n\nHe bows once more and withdraws.\n\nDon Fadrique's Embassy to Burgundy (Summer-Autumn 1439)\n\nContext:\nDon Fadrique travels to Bruges, the glittering heart of Burgundian commerce and culture. Duke Philip the Good holds court there amidst wealth that rivals any kingdom—Flemish tapestries, Italian paintings, goldsmiths' work beyond price. The Order of the Golden Fleece meets in solemn chapter. Musicians and poets attend the Duke's pleasure.\n\nPhilip is fifty-three years old, at the height of his power. His strategic focus (as we have determined) is on Low Countries expansion—Luxembourg, Liège, Utrecht. He has extracted himself from the Hundred Years' War without fully breaking with England. France grows stronger, which concerns him, but he has made no moves toward reconciliation with Charles VII.\n\nFactors Favoring a Successful Embassy:\n\nDon Fadrique is charming, likeable, and well-traveled\n\nCastilian merino wool is highly valuable to Flemish weavers\n\nJuan's crusading prestige commands respect across Christendom\n\nPhilip craves recognition as a sovereign equal to kings\n\nThe Order of the Golden Fleece was founded with crusading ideals\n\nCastile offers friendship without demanding entanglement in French wars\n\nPhilip has daughters and nieces of marriageable age\n\nFactors Working Against:\n\nDon Fadrique lacks experience in high-stakes negotiation\n\nPhilip's focus is on the Low Countries, not the Mediterranean\n\nBurgundy has no direct interest in Ottoman affairs\n\nThe distance from Flanders to Constantinople is vast\n\nPhilip may suspect Castile of ulterior motives\n\nCommitting Burgundian knights to crusade weakens Philip's position in the north\n\nPhilip is cautious by nature—he did not become this powerful by rushing into commitments\n\nComplicating Factors:\n\nEnglish agents in Bruges will note Castilian presence\n\nFrench spies will report to Charles VII\n\nFlemish merchants have their own interests in any trade negotiations\n\nPhilip's court is full of competing factions\n\nThe Duke's health and age (53) may affect his long-term thinking\n\nd100: Don Fadrique's Embassy to Burgundy (Summer-Autumn 1439)\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-5\nDiplomatic Disaster — Don Fadrique commits a serious error—an ill-judged remark, a breach of protocol, or an unintended insult to Burgundian honor. Philip takes offense. The embassy ends in cold formality. Castile's reputation at the Burgundian court damaged. Doors closed for years.\n6-10\nPolite Rejection — Philip receives Don Fadrique with courtesy but maintains studied distance. The Duke listens, thanks Castile for its friendship, commits to nothing. No trade agreements, no crusade interest, no marriage discussions. A wasted journey.\n11-20\nCourteous Indifference — The embassy is received well enough, but Philip is distracted by Low Countries matters. Don Fadrique secures a few audiences but cannot capture the Duke's sustained attention. Minor trade courtesies exchanged. Crusade mentioned but not pursued. No progress on substance.\n21-30\nMixed Reception — Philip is intrigued by some proposals, cool toward others. Trade discussions proceed promisingly, but crusade invitation politely deflected—Burgundy's knights are needed closer to home. Marriage mentioned in passing but not pursued. Partial success at best.\n31-40\nCommercial Success Only — Don Fadrique's charm works well with Flemish merchants and guild masters. Favorable wool trade arrangements negotiated. But Philip himself remains guarded on political matters. Crusade declined. Marriage not seriously discussed. Economic ties strengthened; strategic alignment elusive.\n41-50\nRespectful Engagement — Philip receives Don Fadrique warmly and engages seriously with Castile's proposals. Trade agreements advanced. Crusade discussed with genuine interest but no commitment—Philip wishes to \"consider the matter further.\" Marriage possibilities acknowledged but deferred. A foundation laid; nothing concluded.\n51-60\nStrategic Conversation — Don Fadrique succeeds in securing private audiences with Philip. Frank discussions about France, England, and Burgundy's position. Philip appreciates Castile's recognition of his sovereign dignity. Trade terms favorable. Crusade possible \"if circumstances permit.\" Marriage negotiations opened tentatively. Real progress.\n61-70\nWarm Reception — Philip takes a liking to the young Castilian envoy. Extended conversations about chivalry, crusade, and the Order of the Golden Fleece. Philip expresses genuine admiration for Juan's deeds at Constantinople. Trade agreements signed. Crusade contribution discussed seriously—perhaps a company of knights, ships, or gold. Marriage candidates identified for future discussion. Strong foundation established.\n71-80\nStrategic Alignment — Philip sees in Castile a potential counterweight to both France and England. Extensive private discussions about the future shape of Christendom. Trade agreements generous. Philip commits to \"meaningful support\" for crusade—details to be negotiated. Marriage alliance actively pursued; specific candidates discussed. Juan invited to correspond directly with Philip.\n81-85\nBrotherhood of Princes — Philip and Don Fadrique establish remarkable rapport. The Duke speaks openly of his ambitions, his fears about France, his desire for recognition. He proposes Juan's admission to the Order of the Golden Fleece as a brother sovereign. Substantial crusade contribution offered. Marriage negotiations accelerated. Philip suggests a personal meeting between himself and Juan.\n86-90\nBurgundian Crusade Enthusiasm — The crusading ideal captures Philip's imagination. He sees an opportunity for glory that his Low Countries maneuvering cannot provide. Commits significant forces—hundreds of knights, ships, substantial treasury contribution. Demands prominent role and titles in the campaign. Marriage alliance to seal the partnership. Philip eager to move quickly.\n91-95\nGrand Alliance Proposed — Philip reveals his deepest ambitions to Don Fadrique: a Burgundian kingdom, independent of France, allied with Castile against all threats. He proposes comprehensive partnership—military, commercial, dynastic. Crusade as the first joint venture. Marriage between royal houses to cement the bond. Philip ready to negotiate at the highest level.\n96-100\nThe Burgundian Vision Shared — Philip the Good sees in Juan II a kindred spirit—a prince who completed an impossible conquest, who dreams of Christian empire, who commands respect across Christendom. He opens his heart completely: his plans for the Low Countries, his fears of France, his dreams of a crown. He proposes nothing less than a permanent alliance of equals—Castile and Burgundy as the twin pillars of a new Christian order. Crusade, trade, marriage, mutual defense—everything on the table. Philip offers to travel to Castile himself to seal the compact with Juan in person.\n\nRoll when ready, Sicco.",

      "text": "Don Íñigo is the experienced, proud diplomat - a poet and scholar. He's being sent to feel out French interest in Castilian assistance, with the understanding that Juan wants something in return - prestige, claims, possibly marriage.\n\nI need to have Don Íñigo ask clarifying questions before departing, then draft a d100 table for the French reception.\n\nLet me think about the context:\n- France's strategic intent (roll 48) was \"Military Reform Priority\" - Charles VII is focused on building the army that will eventually win, the compagnies d'ordonnance, artillery corps, professional officers. Preparing for future campaigns rather than rushing present ones.\n- France is growing stronger\n- England is searching for new allies (roll 89)\n- Burgundy is focused on Low Countries expansion (roll 64)\n- The Congress of Arras was a stalemate (roll 16)\n\nSo France is in a relatively strong position - they're building strength methodically. They may not feel desperate need for Castilian help, but naval assistance could be valuable. The French Mediterranean coast, operations against English Gascony, etc.\n\nDon Íñigo's questions should reflect his experience and the complexity of approaching the French court.\n\nDon Íñigo López de Mendoza steps forward, his bearing dignified, his expression thoughtful. Unlike the younger Don Fadrique, there is no eager charm here—only the measured gravity of a man who has negotiated with popes and princes for three decades.\n\n\"Your Majesty honors me with this charge.\"\n\nHe strokes his grey-streaked beard, considering.\n\n\"I have questions, yes. The French situation is... delicate. King Charles was once the Dauphin whom all Europe mocked—the 'King of Bourges' who ruled nothing south of the Loire. Now he grows stronger each year. His treasury fills. His armies professionalize. He no longer needs help as desperately as he once did.\"\n\nHis eyes meet yours.\n\n\"First—the matter of our recent history. Castile aided King Alfonso in Naples against French claims. René of Anjou retreated in defeat. Charles VII has not forgotten this. When I arrive at the French court, I will be received as the representative of a king who helped crush French ambitions in Italy.\" He pauses. \"How do you wish me to address this? Do I acknowledge it openly? Apologize? Justify? Or simply... not mention it unless pressed?\"\n\nHe raises a second point.\n\n\"Second—naval assistance. You mention your fleet. This is valuable, yes. But for what purpose? Against England in the Channel, Castilian ships would be far from home, operating in unfamiliar waters. Against English Gascony from the sea—this is more feasible. Or do you envision something else? I must understand what you are genuinely prepared to offer before I can negotiate.\"\n\nA third finger.\n\n\"Third—claims and prestige. France has little to offer in the Mediterranean; that is Aragon's sphere. But in the Atlantic...\" He glances at the map. \"English Gascony. If France recovers it—with or without our help—there are lordships, titles, perhaps even territories that border our own lands. The Duchy of Aquitaine was once the grandest fief in France. Are you interested in such things? Or do you speak of claims further afield?\"\n\nHe hesitates before his final question.\n\n\"Fourth—and most sensitive—marriage. King Charles has children. His son Louis is the Dauphin, heir to France. There are daughters as well, I believe. But a marriage between Castile and France would alarm England, alarm Burgundy, perhaps alarm Aragon. It would be seen as a statement of alliance, not merely friendship.\" His gaze is penetrating. \"Is that your intention, Majesty? To align Castile with France against her enemies? Or do you wish me to explore without committing—as Don Fadrique does in Burgundy?\"",

England's recent diplomatic setback with Castile creates an opportunity, but also risks escalating tensions. Brittany's semi-autonomous status means Breton port access isn't guaranteed, requiring delicate negotiation. The potential English territorial claims remain ambiguous, potentially weakening Castile's diplomatic leverage. Papal diplomatic pressures could further complicate these intricate negotiations.\n\nDon Íñigo bows with the gravity befitting his years and station.\n\n\"I understand, Majesty. I shall present Castile as a power with Mediterranean interests that happened to support a kinsman's claim—not as an enemy of France. The distinction is subtle but important.\"\n\nHe pauses, considering.\n\n\"One clarification on the matter of Brittany. Duke John V rules there—he is nominally a vassal of France, but Brittany has been functionally independent for generations. The Breton ports are his to grant, not King Charles's. If you wish me to explore the use of Breton harbors, I may need to make a separate approach to Duke John. Or I can raise the matter with Charles and see if he believes he can deliver Breton cooperation.\"\n\nHe waits for your response, then nods.\n\n\"As for English lands—I understand. I shall not ask Charles to carve pieces from France. But if the conversation turns to the future disposition of English holdings once they are conquered... I will listen carefully.\"\n\nHe gathers himself with the dignity of a man who has stood before the Pope himself.\n\n\"I shall depart within a fortnight, Majesty. The roads to Paris are long, but I have traveled them before.\"\n\nHe bows and withdraws.\n\nDon Íñigo's Embassy to France (Summer-Autumn 1439)\n\nContext:\nDon Íñigo travels to the court of Charles VII, which moves between various châteaux in the Loire Valley—Chinon, Loches, Tours. The French king is no longer the desperate fugitive of his youth. His kingdom stabilizes, his revenues grow, and his military reforms bear fruit. The compagnies d'ordonnance—professional standing troops—are transforming French military capacity.\n\nFrance's strategic focus (as determined) is on military reform, building the army that will eventually drive the English out. Charles is patient, methodical, and cautious. He remembers his allies and his enemies alike.\n\nThe Naples matter looms. René of Anjou—Charles's brother-in-law—was humiliated by the Castilian-Aragonese alliance. The Angevin faction at court has not forgotten. Yet Charles is pragmatic. If Castile offers genuine advantage, he may set aside past grievances.\n\nFactors Favoring Success:\n\nDon Íñigo is a diplomat of the highest caliber—experienced, learned, commanding respect\n\nCastilian naval power against England is genuinely valuable\n\nCharles VII is pragmatic and has reconciled with former enemies before\n\nFrench military reform focus means Charles is thinking long-term; allies matter\n\nA Castilian princess would be a prestigious match\n\nCastile's Mediterranean position does not directly threaten French interests\n\nThe crusading angle may appeal to French chivalric ideals\n\nFactors Working Against:\n\nNaples defeat is recent; René of Anjou's faction will oppose any Castilian friendship\n\nDon Íñigo's pride may clash with French court protocol\n\nFrance is growing confident; Charles may feel he doesn't need Castilian help\n\nAligning with Castile risks alarming Burgundy, with whom Charles still hopes to reconcile\n\nThe request for \"English lands\" is awkward—what lands, exactly?\n\nCharles may suspect Juan is playing all sides (which he is)\n\nFrench court factions are complex and treacherous\n\nComplicating Factors:\n\nBrittany is semi-independent; Charles cannot simply deliver Breton ports\n\nEnglish spies will report Castilian presence at the French court\n\nBurgundian agents will also take note\n\nThe Angevin faction (Queen Marie, René's supporters) wields influence\n\nCharles's heir, the Dauphin Louis, is notoriously difficult and unpredictable\n\nFrench pride may bristle at the implication they need help\n\nd100: Don Íñigo's Embassy to France (Summer-Autumn 1439)\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-5\nDiplomatic Humiliation — The Naples wound proves too fresh. René of Anjou's faction orchestrates a cold reception. Don Íñigo's pride is provoked; sharp words are exchanged. The embassy collapses in mutual recrimination. Franco-Castilian relations damaged for years. Charles publicly distances himself from any Castilian overture.\n6-10\nHostile Reception — Don Íñigo is received, but the Angevin faction dominates every audience. Queen Marie is pointedly absent. Charles is polite but glacial. Every proposal is deflected with vague courtesy. The message is clear: France remembers Naples. No progress on any front.\n11-20\nPolite Stonewalling — Charles grants audiences but commits to nothing. Don Íñigo's proposals are heard, acknowledged, and filed away. The King speaks of \"future consideration\" and \"the complexity of the times.\" Naval cooperation deferred. Marriage not discussed. A wasted journey wrapped in courteous words.\n21-30\nMixed Signals — Some French councillors show interest; others remain hostile. Charles himself is inscrutable. Trade courtesies exchanged. Naval cooperation mentioned but not pursued seriously. Marriage raised obliquely but not advanced. Don Íñigo returns with impressions but no agreements.\n31-40\nGrudging Acknowledgment — Charles accepts that Naples was dynastic, not anti-French. The ice thaws slightly. Preliminary discussions on commercial matters proceed. Naval assistance noted as \"potentially valuable\" but no mechanism established. Marriage mentioned as a distant possibility. A foot in the door, nothing more.\n41-50\nCautious Interest — Charles proves more pragmatic than his councillors. Private audiences reveal genuine curiosity about Castilian intentions. Naval cooperation discussed in general terms. The King asks pointed questions about Burgundy—what has Juan offered Philip? Don Íñigo's discretion is tested. Some trust established. Marriage acknowledged as worth exploring.\n51-60\nSubstantive Engagement — Don Íñigo's experience and dignity impress the French court. Charles sets aside the Naples grievance in favor of practical discussion. Naval cooperation against England seriously explored—patrol routes, communication, coordination. Marriage candidates identified. Brittany question raised; Charles promises to \"facilitate\" discussions with Duke John. Real progress.\n61-70\nStrategic Conversation — Charles speaks frankly about France's position: Burgundy drifts, England weakens, but the war drags on. Castilian naval power could accelerate English collapse. Detailed discussions on fleet deployment. Charles raises the possibility of joint operations against Gascony. Marriage negotiations opened formally. Don Íñigo invited to remain at court for extended discussions.\n71-80\nWarm Reception — The French court receives Don Íñigo with unexpected warmth. Charles publicly acknowledges Castile's role in defending Christendom against the Ottomans. Naval cooperation agreement drafted. Marriage discussions advance—specific princesses and princes named. Charles hints that once English Gascony falls, Castile's \"interests along the Pyrenean frontier\" might be accommodated.\n81-85\nAlliance Foundations — Charles sees opportunity. A Castilian fleet in the Channel could end the war in years rather than decades. Formal naval cooperation treaty proposed. Marriage alliance actively pursued—the Dauphin Louis is unmarried, as are several French princesses. Charles offers to write personally to Juan. Discusses pressuring Brittany to open ports. Franco-Castilian partnership taking shape.\n86-90\nStrategic Partnership — Charles and Don Íñigo develop genuine rapport. The King opens up about his long-term vision: a restored France, dominant in the west, at peace with its neighbors. He sees Castile as a natural partner, not a rival. Comprehensive discussions on naval operations, troop contributions, and post-war territorial arrangements. Marriage treaty drafted. Juan invited to send a higher embassy—or come himself.\n91-95\nGrand Design — Charles proposes nothing less than a joint campaign to end the Hundred Years' War. Castilian fleets and French armies, coordinated for a decisive blow. In exchange: formal alliance, royal marriage, and recognition of Castilian \"historic claims\" along the Gascon frontier. Charles willing to negotiate seriously about territorial adjustments. A transformed strategic landscape.\n96-100\nThe French Embrace — Charles VII, ever the pragmatist, sees in Juan II the ally who can finally end a century of war. He sets aside all grievances, overrules the Angevin faction, and proposes a full military and dynastic alliance. Naval cooperation, joint campaigns, marriage between the Dauphin and a Castilian princess—or a French princess for Fernando. Territorial discussions open and generous. Charles offers to meet Juan in person at the frontier to seal an accord that will reshape western Christendom.\n\nRoll when ready, Sicco.",

Thinly veiled offense at Juan's \"disappointment.\" Channel remains technically open but effectively frozen.\n\n2. **Burgundy**: Rolled 38 - \"Commercial Success Only\" - Don Fadrique's charm works well with Flemish merchants and guild masters. Favorable wool trade arrangements negotiated. But Philip himself remains guarded on political matters. Crusade declined. Marriage not seriously discussed. Economic ties strengthened; strategic alignment elusive.\n\n3. **France**: Rolled 55 - \"Substantive Engagement\" - Don Íñigo's experience and dignity impress the French court. Charles sets aside the Naples grievance in favor of practical discussion. Naval cooperation against England seriously explored—patrol routes, communication, coordination. Marriage candidates identified. Brittany question raised; Charles promises to \"facilitate\" discussions with Duke John. Real progress.\n\nSo now Juan receives his envoys back. Let me write this scene showing both Don Fadrique returning from Burgundy and Don Íñigo returning from France, with their reports.\n\nTimeline:\n- The envoys were sent in Summer 1439\n- They would return in Autumn/Winter 1439\n\nLet me write this scene.\n\nLate Autumn 1439\n\nThe Alcázar of Toledo, Council Chamber\n\nThe leaves have turned gold and red across Castile when your envoys return within a week of each other—Don Fadrique from Bruges, Don Íñigo from the Loire Valley. You summon them together, along with Álvaro, Lucia, Isaac, and Diego de Daza. The reports they bring will shape the coming years.\n\nDon Fadrique speaks first, as befits his earlier departure.\n\nReport from Burgundy\n\nThe young envoy stands before the council, less buoyant than when he departed. Not defeated—but sobered.\n\n\"Majesty, Duke Philip received me with every courtesy. His court is...\" He pauses, searching for words. \"It is the most magnificent I have ever seen. Bruges alone holds more wealth than most kingdoms. The tapestries, the goldwork, the paintings—and the Duke himself presides over it all like an emperor without a crown.\"\n\nHe takes a breath.\n\n\"I delivered Your Majesty's greetings, your admiration for the Order of the Golden Fleece, your invitation to join the crusade against the Ottomans. The Duke listened with what seemed genuine interest. He spoke admiringly of Your Majesty's deeds at Constantinople—he called you 'a prince who remembers what Christian chivalry means.'\"\n\nDon Fadrique's expression clouds.\n\n\"But when I pressed for commitment, he retreated into courtesies. The crusade is 'a noble enterprise' that Burgundy 'cannot presently support with the attention it deserves.' His knights are needed closer to home. Luxembourg occupies his attention. Liège threatens disorder. The Bishop of Utrecht defies him.\"\n\nHe glances at his notes.\n\n\"On the matter of France and England, the Duke was... careful. He acknowledged that Castile's friendship would be valuable. He spoke warmly of Your Majesty's wisdom in 'keeping options open.' But he would not discuss strategic alignment. When I raised—delicately—the possibility of a Burgundian kingdom independent of France, he changed the subject.\"\n\n\"And marriage?\" Lucia asks.\n\nDon Fadrique shakes his head. \"I identified the candidates, Your Majesty. Duke Philip has three daughters by his current wife, Isabella of Portugal—\" He pauses, glancing at you. \"Your late Queen Isabel's cousin, I believe. The eldest, Marie, is not yet three years old. The others are infants. There are nieces of marriageable age, but when I raised the subject, the Duke deflected. He spoke of 'the complexity of dynastic arrangements' and 'the need for careful consideration.'\"\n\nHe straightens.\n\n\"I did achieve one success, Majesty. The wool trade. The Flemish merchants are hungry for Castilian merino, and I negotiated favorable terms—direct shipments to Bruges and Ghent, reduced tariffs, guaranteed quantities. The commercial agreements are signed and sealed.\"\n\nHe produces a leather folder of documents.\n\n\"Duke Philip's signature is on the trade compact. It is something. But...\" He meets your eyes. \"The Duke is focused on his own ambitions in the Low Countries. He sees the Ottoman war as distant, the French situation as something to be managed rather than resolved. He respects Your Majesty. He will trade with Your Majesty. But he will not commit to anything that might distract from his immediate objectives.\"\n\nReport from France\n\nDon Íñigo López de Mendoza steps forward as Don Fadrique withdraws. The older diplomat's bearing is more confident—the set of his shoulders suggests a man who has accomplished something meaningful.\n\n\"Majesty, my reception in France was... better than I had reason to expect.\"\n\nHe folds his hands behind his back.\n\n\"King Charles remembered Naples. The Angevin faction—Queen Marie, the Duke of Anjou's supporters—made their displeasure known. For the first week, I was received with correct formality and nothing more. Audiences were brief. Questions were deflected.\"\n\nA thin smile crosses his face.\n\n\"But King Charles is not ruled by his wife's family. He is a pragmatist who has survived by knowing when to hold grudges and when to set them aside. When I explained that Castile's intervention in Naples was a matter of family obligation within our sphere of influence—not enmity toward France—he listened. When I described Your Majesty's naval capacity and your willingness to deploy it against England, he listened more intently.\"\n\nDon Íñigo produces his own documents.\n\n\"We discussed patrol routes along the Gascon coast. Your carracks operating from Castilian ports—and potentially from Breton harbors—could interdict English supply ships, isolate their garrisons, and make the occupation of Gascony untenable. King Charles was genuinely interested. He asked detailed questions about ship numbers, ranges, provisioning.\"\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\"On Brittany, the King acknowledged the complication. Duke John V is his vassal in name, but Brittany guards its independence jealously. Charles promised to 'facilitate' discussions—to write to Duke John encouraging cooperation. He cannot command it, but he can smooth the path.\"\n\nÁlvaro leans forward. \"And the marriage question?\"\n\n\"Discussed seriously, my lord.\" Don Íñigo nods. \"King Charles has several children. The Dauphin Louis is seventeen—unmarried, and by all accounts... difficult. Sharp-tongued, suspicious of his own father, impatient for power. A match there would be prestigious but potentially troubled.\"\n\nHe continues. \"There are also daughters. Princess Radegonde is young—perhaps six or seven. There are others. And King Charles expressed interest in Your Majesty's children as well—the Princess Catalina's reputation has reached even the French court.\"\n\nDon Íñigo's expression becomes more serious.\n\n\"I raised, as delicately as possible, the question of what Castile might gain from assisting France. The King did not offer French territory—as Your Majesty predicted. But he said something interesting.\"\n\nHe pauses for effect.\n\n\"He said: 'When English Gascony is French once more, there will be matters along the Pyrenean frontier that merit discussion between friends.' He did not specify. But the implication was clear—he is willing to negotiate adjustments once victory is achieved.\"\n\nDon Íñigo bows his head.\n\n\"In sum, Majesty: France is interested. Not allied, not committed, but genuinely interested. King Charles wishes to continue discussions. He invited Your Majesty to send a more senior embassy—or to correspond directly. He spoke of a possible meeting at the frontier, should matters advance sufficiently.\"\n\nThe council falls silent. Álvaro looks at the maps spread across the table. Lucia's eyes move between the two envoys. Isaac de Baeza stands in his corner, no doubt already calculating how these reports affect his networks.\n\nÁlvaro speaks first.\n\n\"So. England sulks. Burgundy trades but will not fight. France extends a hand, cautiously.\" He looks at you. \"The northern powers circle each other while Castile stands outside the dance. What does Your Majesty wish to do with this... opportunity?\"",

      "text": "Don Íñigo exchanges a glance with Isaac de Baeza. The spymaster steps forward slightly, deferring to the diplomat but ready to supplement.\n\n\"The Dauphin Louis,\" Don Íñigo begins carefully, \"is... not what one expects from the heir to the French throne.\"\n\nHe pauses, choosing his words.\n\n\"He is seventeen years old. Physically unremarkable—slight of build, with a long nose and small eyes that miss nothing. He dresses plainly, almost meanly, without the finery one expects from a prince. He despises tournaments and the trappings of chivalry. He has no interest in poetry, music, or the courtly arts.\"\n\nDon Íñigo's brow furrows.\n\n\"But he is clever, Majesty. Perhaps the cleverest young man I have ever encountered. He listens more than he speaks. He remembers everything. He cultivates friendships among servants and minor officials while ignoring the great lords. The French nobility distrust him; he seems to prefer it that way.\"\n\nIsaac de Baeza clears his throat.\n\n\"My agents in France paint a darker picture, Majesty. The Dauphin and his father despise each other. It is an open secret at court. Charles VII fears his own son—fears his ambition, his impatience, his web of informants. Louis, for his part, believes his father is weak, surrounded by corrupt favorites, and too slow to prosecute the war against England.\"\n\nIsaac consults a small notebook.\n\n\"There have been... incidents. Two years ago, Louis involved himself in a conspiracy of nobles against his father's counselors—the Praguerie, they called it. Charles forgave him publicly, but the wound festers. Louis was sent away to govern the Dauphiné, far from court. Father and son have barely spoken since.\"\n\nDon Íñigo nods gravely.\n\n\"When I raised the matter of marriage, King Charles spoke of Louis with visible discomfort. He praised his son's intelligence but warned me—obliquely—that Louis 'has his own mind in all things.' I believe the King fears that any bride sent to Louis would become a tool in the son's schemes against the father.\"\n\nLucia speaks up, her voice cool.\n\n\"So the heir to France is a snake who plots against his own blood.\" She looks at you. \"And we would consider sending one of our daughters into that nest?\"\n\nDon Íñigo raises a hand.\n\n\"There is another way to see it, Your Majesty. Louis will be King of France someday—perhaps sooner than his father hopes. He is unloved, yes. Suspicious, yes. But he is also capable. A bride who won his trust—truly won it—would wield enormous influence. And Louis respects competence above all things. A princess who matched his intelligence, who could be a partner rather than an ornament...\"\n\nHe trails off, letting the implication hang.\n\n\"The Princess Catalina,\" Isaac says quietly, \"is seven years old. Brilliant, composed, commanding. By the time she is of marriageable age, Louis will likely be King. And by all accounts, he values sharp minds over gentle dispositions.\"\n\nÁlvaro grunts.\n\n\"A match made in cold calculation rather than warm affection. It might work—or it might place a Castilian princess in a court of whispers and daggers, wed to a man who trusts no one.\"\n\nHe looks at you.\n\n\"The question, Majesty, is what kind of future you envision. An alliance with France through Louis would be powerful but perilous. The Dauphin does not forget slights—nor does he forget favors. If Catalina were to become his queen, Castile would have a friend on the French throne... or an enemy who knows us too well.\"",

      "text": "1. From Don Íñigo's report, Charles VII said something vague: \"When English Gascony is French once more, there will be matters along the Pyrenean frontier that merit discussion between friends.\" This is deliberately vague - he hasn't offered anything specific. The user is right to press on this.\n\n2. For Burgundy's inheritance - this is historically interesting. Philip the Good married three times:\n- First wife: Michelle of Valois (died 1422, no surviving children)\n- Second wife: Bonne of Artois (died 1425, no children)\n- Third wife: Isabella of Portugal (married 1430) - she was indeed a cousin of Isabel of Portugal (Juan's first wife)\n\nPhilip and Isabella of Portugal had one son who survived to adulthood: Charles, Count of Charolais (the future Charles the Bold), born in 1433. So in 1439, Charles would be about 6 years old.\n\nPhilip also had many illegitimate children, but they couldn't inherit.\n\nSo the heir to Burgundy is young Charles, Count of Charolais, who is about 6 years old in 1439.\n\nDon Fadrique mentioned Philip's daughters by Isabella of Portugal - Marie (not yet 3), and infants. But the heir would be Charles.\n\nLet me have the council answer these questions appropriately.\n\nDon Íñigo shakes his head slowly.\n\n\"Nothing specific, Majesty. The King spoke only in implications. 'Matters along the Pyrenean frontier that merit discussion between friends.'\" He spreads his hands. \"I pressed—gently—but Charles would not be drawn further. He is too cautious to promise what he has not yet won.\"\n\nHe moves to the map table, tracing the border with his finger.\n\n\"The lands in question would be these: the counties and lordships along the Pyrenees that currently lie within English Gascony or in the disputed marches. Labourd, Soule, perhaps parts of Béarn. Historically, some of these territories owed allegiance to Navarrese or Aragonese lords before the English absorbed them into Aquitaine.\"\n\nÁlvaro strokes his chin.\n\n\"In other words, Charles offers the possibility of discussing lands he does not yet possess, which may or may not have been ours centuries ago.\" His tone is dry. \"Generous.\"\n\n\"It is an opening, my lord,\" Don Íñigo replies. \"Nothing more. But consider—if Castilian fleets help strangle English Gascony, and Castilian troops land to assist the final conquest, Charles will find it difficult to deny us something. The question is whether that something is worth the cost of intervention.\"\n\nIsaac de Baeza steps forward to address the second question.\n\n\"As for Burgundy's succession, Majesty—Duke Philip has an heir. A son.\"\n\nHe consults his notes.\n\n\"Charles, Count of Charolais. Born in 1433, so he is six years old now. His mother is Isabella of Portugal—\" Isaac pauses, glancing at you. \"The daughter of King João I. Your late Queen Isabel's aunt, which makes young Charles her cousin.\"\n\nLucia's eyes narrow. \"So Fernando and Catalina are related to the Burgundian heir through Isabel's blood.\"\n\n\"Distantly, yes, Your Majesty. The houses are connected.\"\n\nIsaac continues. \"The boy Charles is Duke Philip's only legitimate son. By all reports, Philip dotes on him—he is the culmination of three marriages and many disappointments. Philip's first two wives died without giving him surviving children. Isabella of Portugal finally produced an heir after three years of marriage.\"\n\n\"What manner of child is he?\" you ask.\n\n\"Too young to say with certainty, Majesty. But my agents report he is being raised in the full magnificence of the Burgundian court. Tutors, arms training, the finest education gold can buy. Philip intends him to inherit everything—the duchies, the counties, the wealth, the ambitions.\"\n\nIsaac hesitates.\n\n\"There is one complication. The Burgundian inheritance is... complex. Some territories descend through male lines only. Others can pass through females. If young Charles were to die without heirs, the succession would fracture—some lands reverting to France, others to the Empire, others contested among cousins and claimants.\"\n\nÁlvaro leans back in his chair.\n\n\"So Philip has a single son, aged six, upon whom all his dreams depend. No wonder he focuses on the Low Countries rather than distant crusades. He is building a patrimony for that boy—and praying the child lives long enough to inherit it.\"\n\nDon Fadrique speaks up.\n\n\"The Duke did mention his son, Majesty. Briefly, proudly. He said Charles would one day 'unite what history has divided.' I took it to mean the Burgundian lands—but perhaps he dreams of more.\"\n\nLucia taps her finger on the table thoughtfully.\n\n\"A six-year-old heir to the richest domains in Christendom. And we have daughters approaching marriageable age.\" She looks at you. \"Catalina is seven. Bianca is four, but her beauty is already remarkable. If we wished to bind Burgundy to Castile for a generation...\"\n\nShe leaves the thought unfinished.",

We have opened doors without walking through them. When circumstances change—and they will—those doors remain available.\"\n\nHe begins rolling up the maps of France and Burgundy.\n\n\"Now, let us consider what has actually transpired in the north while our envoys were exchanging courtesies.\"\n\nThe Hundred Years' War: Arras to February 1439\n\nContext:\nThe Congress of Arras ended in stalemate (1435). Since then, the three powers have pursued their determined strategies:\n\nBurgundy focuses on Low Countries expansion—Luxembourg, Liège, Utrecht\n\nEngland searches desperately for new allies while its position slowly erodes\n\nFrance prioritizes military reform, building the professional army that will eventually win\n\nThis creates a period of relative quiet on the main fronts. No major offensives, no decisive battles. But war grinds on regardless—raids, sieges, skirmishes, economic pressure. Three and a half years of attritional conflict.\n\nFactors Suggesting Continued Stalemate:\n\nAll three parties are relatively passive in their war aims\n\nBurgundy effectively neutral, focused elsewhere\n\nEngland lacks resources for offensive operations\n\nFrance building strength rather than spending it\n\nNo catalyst for dramatic change\n\nFactors That Could Shift the Balance:\n\nLocal commanders acting on initiative\n\nEconomic exhaustion forcing decisions\n\nDeaths of key figures\n\nUnexpected diplomatic developments\n\nPopular unrest or rebellion\n\nDisease, famine, or other catastrophes\n\nWild Cards:\n\nThe Dauphin Louis's ambitions and intrigues\n\nBreton independence calculations\n\nScottish involvement (France's traditional ally)\n\nPapal pressure for peace\n\nIndividual English garrisons surrendering or defecting\n\nd100: The Hundred Years' War, 1435-February 1439\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-5\nEnglish Collapse Begins — A catastrophic defeat or mass defection breaks English morale. Several key garrisons surrender. Normandy's defense perimeter crumbles. France advances dramatically despite not planning major offensives. The end of English France suddenly seems imminent.\n6-10\nFrench Setback — Despite their caution, France suffers an unexpected reverse. A capable English commander wins a significant victory. French reform efforts disrupted. Charles VII's government shaken. The war's timeline extends by years.\n11-15\nBurgundian Intervention — Something draws Philip back into the French war despite his Low Countries focus. Perhaps English pressure, perhaps French provocation, perhaps opportunity. Burgundy's weight tips the balance—but in which direction? (Sub-roll required)\n16-25\nGrinding Attrition Favors France — No dramatic events, but the slow mathematics of war favor Charles VII. English garrisons shrink through desertion and lack of pay. French territory slowly expands at the margins. By 1439, England's position is notably weaker than 1435.\n26-40\nStalemate Holds — The war continues much as before. Raids and counter-raids. Minor sieges. Economic exhaustion on all sides. No significant territorial changes. Both England and France are weaker, but neither has gained decisive advantage.\n41-55\nUneasy Quiet — The fighting diminishes to its lowest intensity in decades. Local truces proliferate. Trade resumes in some areas. Both sides rebuild. An unofficial peace exists in practice, though not in name. The question becomes who will break the calm first.\n56-65\nEnglish Consolidation — Despite lacking allies, England's commanders in France achieve a defensive stabilization. Key positions reinforced. Supply lines secured. The decline slows. England buys time—though for what purpose remains unclear.\n66-75\nFrench Probing Offensives — Charles's reformed forces conduct limited operations to test English defenses. Several small successes. Key towns change hands. France gains confidence. The groundwork is laid for larger campaigns when the King judges the moment right.\n76-80\nBurgundian Low Countries Success — Philip achieves his objectives. Luxembourg secured. Liège subdued. Utrecht brought to heel. With his northern ambitions satisfied, Philip may turn his attention elsewhere—perhaps back to the French question.\n81-85\nDiplomatic Realignment — An unexpected alliance or agreement reshapes the strategic landscape. Perhaps Brittany commits to one side. Perhaps Scotland intervenes. Perhaps a marriage alliance changes calculations. The war's dynamics shift.\n86-90\nInternal French Turmoil — The Dauphin Louis's intrigues create crisis at Charles VII's court. Father and son clash openly. French unity fractures. England gains breathing room. The reformed army's potential squandered on internal conflict.\n91-95\nEnglish Diplomatic Breakthrough — England's search for allies bears unexpected fruit. A significant power—Brittany, an Imperial prince, or another party—commits to supporting English claims. The war's trajectory changes.\n96-100\nTransformative Event — Something unprecedented occurs: a major figure's death, a popular uprising, a military innovation, or a diplomatic revolution. The Hundred Years' War enters a new phase entirely. (Sub-roll required for specifics)\n\nRoll when ready, Sicco.",

This sets the stage for the present moment (Spring 1439) and Juan's decision about whether to intervene or focus on the Ottomans.\n\nLet me narrate this outcome and then we can return to the present.\n\nThe Hundred Years' War: Stalemate Holds (1435-1439)\n\nIsaac de Baeza produces a thin sheaf of reports from his ever-present satchel.\n\n\"The war in the north continues, Majesty, but it is a war of exhaustion rather than decision.\"\n\nHe summarizes the intelligence gathered over four years.\n\nBurgundy has effectively withdrawn from the conflict. Duke Philip's armies marched not against France or for England, but into Luxembourg, which he claimed through his aunt's inheritance. The Duchy fell to him in 1437 after a brief campaign. His attention then turned to the Prince-Bishopric of Liège, where he has installed a compliant bishop and cowed the rebellious communes. Utrecht remains troublesome, but Philip applies pressure steadily.\n\n\"The Duke fights his own wars now,\" Isaac notes. \"The English alliance exists on parchment. In practice, Burgundy is neutral.\"\n\nEngland clings to her possessions with desperate tenacity. Normandy remains in English hands, but the garrisons are underpaid, undersupplied, and slowly shrinking. Desertion bleeds men away month by month. The Duke of York—Richard of York, now Lieutenant of France—struggles to maintain order with inadequate resources.\n\n\"Parliament refuses to fund the war properly,\" Isaac explains. \"The English commons are weary of paying for French adventures that yield nothing. Cardinal Beaufort's faction argues for negotiation; Gloucester's faction demands offensives they cannot afford. The result is paralysis.\"\n\nEnglish Gascony in the south remains more stable—the Gascon lords have been English for three centuries and fear French domination—but even there, the grip loosens at the margins.\n\nFrance grows stronger without fighting. Charles VII's compagnies d'ordonnance now number several thousand professional soldiers—trained, equipped, and paid regularly. The Bureau brothers continue their work on artillery, producing guns that can breach walls once thought impregnable. Tax revenues increase as royal administration extends into recovered territories.\n\n\"But Charles does not strike,\" Isaac says. \"He builds. He waits. He watches the English weaken and hoards his strength for the decisive moment.\"\n\nThere have been skirmishes, raids, minor sieges. Towns change hands—a castle here, a village there. But no great battles, no dramatic campaigns. The war simmers rather than boils.\n\nThe Situation in February 1439\n\nIsaac summarizes:\n\n\"England is weaker than in 1435, but not broken. France is stronger, but has not tested that strength. Burgundy pursues its own course entirely. The war continues because no one has the will or capacity to end it.\"\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\"If Your Majesty were to intervene now—with fleets, with gold, with armies—you would find a conflict ripe for decision. A firm push might collapse the English position within years. Or a different push might prolong it for decades.\"\n\nÁlvaro taps the table.\n\n\"But Your Majesty has determined not to intervene. The northern war is not our concern—not yet.\"\n\nHe looks at you.\n\n\"Which brings us back to the matter at hand. The Ottomans. The crusade. The war Your Majesty does intend to fight.\"\n\nHe gestures to the eastern maps, still spread across the table.\n\n\"We were discussing strategy before the reports from Burgundy and France arrived. You spoke of striking at the Sultan's fleet—at Gallipoli, his great wharf. Shall we return to that question, Majesty? What forces do we have, what forces can we raise, and how do we propose to use them?\"",

My networks in Constantinople, Venice, and Ragusa have been watching closely. But the Ottoman court is difficult to penetrate—the Sultan's inner circle is tight, and informants who speak too freely tend to disappear.\"\n\nHe spreads his hands.\n\n\"I can tell you what we observe. What Murad intends... that requires some interpretation.\"\n\nSultan Murad II: Strategic Context (1435-1439)\n\nBackground:\nMurad II is approximately 35 years old, an experienced ruler who inherited his throne at seventeen. He is known as a capable military commander but also as a man who values peace when it serves Ottoman interests. He has shown willingness to negotiate—the truce with Castile proves this.\n\nHis empire stretches from the Danube to Anatolia, but it faces pressures on multiple fronts:\n\nThe Balkans: Hungary under King Sigismund (now deceased) was a constant threat. Serbia, Bosnia, and Wallachia are restive vassals or hostile neighbors. Albania stirs with rebellion.\n\nAnatolia: The Karamanid Emirate in central Anatolia has defied Ottoman authority for generations. Other beyliks watch for weakness.\n\nConstantinople: The city remains in Byzantine (and now Latin-supported) hands—a thorn in the empire's heart, controlling the straits.\n\nNaval Power: The Ottoman fleet grows at Gallipoli, but Venetian and Genoese naval superiority remains a constraint.\n\nThe Truce with Castile:\nThe ten-year truce (1435-1445) binds both parties. Either side may break it with one year's notice. Murad agreed to it because fighting a Western crusade while managing Balkan and Anatolian threats was unwise. But truces are tools, not principles.\n\nFactors Shaping Ottoman Strategy:\n\nAggressive Possibilities:\n\nConsolidate Balkans before truce ends\n\nReduce Karamanids in Anatolia\n\nBuild naval strength to challenge Western fleets\n\nPrepare siege capabilities for Constantinople\n\nExpand into Hungary now that Sigismund is dead\n\nDefensive/Diplomatic Possibilities:\n\nMaintain truce, avoid provoking Western intervention\n\nFocus on internal consolidation and administration\n\nBuild economic strength through trade\n\nWait for Western powers to exhaust themselves in their own wars\n\nSeek diplomatic arrangements with Venice or Genoa\n\nWild Cards:\n\nSuccession concerns (Murad's son Mehmed is young)\n\nReligious pressure from ulema for jihad\n\nJanissary corps demands for conquest and plunder\n\nUnexpected opportunities or threats\n\nd100: Sultan Murad II's Strategic Focus (1435-1439)\n\nRoll\nStrategic Aim\n1-5\nConstantinople Obsession — Despite the truce, Murad becomes fixated on taking Constantinople. Massive military buildup focused on siege capabilities. Fortifications constructed to isolate the city. The Sultan prepares to break the truce the moment opportunity presents.\n6-10\nNaval Supremacy — Murad prioritizes building a fleet capable of challenging any Christian power. Gallipoli expands dramatically. Shipwrights recruited from across the Mediterranean. The goal: control of the Aegean and eventually the straits.\n11-20\nBalkan Consolidation — The Sultan focuses on securing his European territories. Campaigns against Serbia, Bosnia, Albania. Hungary probed for weakness after Sigismund's death. Goal: an unshakeable Balkan dominion before the truce ends.\n21-30\nAnatolian Pacification — Murad turns east. The Karamanids must be crushed once and for all. Other Anatolian beyliks brought firmly under Ottoman control. A secure rear before any western adventure.\n31-40\nBalanced Expansion — The Sultan pursues opportunities on multiple fronts without overcommitting to any. Pressure on Balkans, pressure on Anatolia, steady naval growth. Patient, methodical empire-building.\n41-50\nStrategic Patience — Murad honors the truce in spirit as well as letter. He consolidates, administers, builds economic strength. No major campaigns. The Sultan waits, watches, and prepares for the long game.\n51-60\nHungarian Focus — With Sigismund dead and the Hungarian succession uncertain, Murad sees opportunity. Major campaigns into Hungarian territory. Testing whether the West will rally to Hungary's defense or leave it isolated.\n61-70\nDiplomatic Maneuvering — Murad pursues strategic relationships. Negotiations with Venice over trade and spheres of influence. Approaches to Genoa. Perhaps even feelers toward Western powers. The Sultan seeks advantage through diplomacy rather than war.\n71-75\nInternal Reform — Murad focuses on strengthening Ottoman institutions. Administrative reforms, tax collection, military organization. Building the machinery of empire rather than expanding its borders.\n76-80\nSuccession Planning — Concerns about his young son Mehmed dominate Murad's thinking. The Sultan takes steps to secure the succession—perhaps naming regents, eliminating rivals, or training the boy for rule. Expansion secondary to dynastic security.\n81-85\nReligious Pressure — The ulema and religious establishment push for jihad. Murad, personally inclined toward peace, finds himself pressured to demonstrate Islamic zeal. Military adventures driven by religious politics rather than strategic calculation.\n86-90\nOpportunistic Aggression — Murad watches for weakness and strikes where he finds it. No fixed strategy—pure opportunism. If the Balkans show vulnerability, he attacks there. If Anatolia rebels, he crushes it. If Constantinople's defenders waver, he probes.\n91-95\nWestern Division Exploitation — Murad recognizes that Christian powers are divided and distracted. His strategy: encourage their conflicts, play them against each other, and expand while they fight amongst themselves. Diplomacy and subversion as much as military force.\n96-100\nGrand Strategic Vision — Murad conceives an ambitious long-term plan. Perhaps coordination with other Muslim powers. Perhaps a revolutionary military innovation. Perhaps a diplomatic masterstroke. The Sultan thinks in decades, not years, and moves pieces into position for a transformation of the Eastern Mediterranean.\n\nRoll when ready, Sicco. Then we will determine how successful the Sultan has been in pursuing his aims.",

Patient, methodical empire-building.\n\nNow I need to draft a d100 table to determine how successful Murad has been in this balanced expansion strategy from 1435-1439.\n\nSultan Murad II's Strategic Aim: Balanced Expansion\n\nIsaac nods slowly as he pieces together the intelligence.\n\n\"The Sultan plays a careful game, Majesty. He does not commit everything to one front—he applies pressure everywhere, steadily, methodically. The Balkans see Ottoman armies probing Serbian and Albanian defenses. Anatolia sees campaigns against the Karamanids. The fleet at Gallipoli grows, ship by ship. He builds strength without provoking a crisis that might unite his enemies.\"\n\nHe gestures eastward on the map.\n\n\"It is the strategy of a patient man. Murad does not seek the decisive battle—he seeks to be ready for it when the moment comes. Every year his empire grows a little stronger, his enemies a little weaker.\"\n\nÁlvaro grunts. \"A dangerous opponent. The reckless ones defeat themselves. The patient ones must be defeated.\"\n\nMurad II's Balanced Expansion: Degree of Success (1435-1439)\n\nContext:\nMurad pursues simultaneous pressure on multiple fronts: Balkan consolidation, Anatolian pacification, and naval growth. This is ambitious but risks overextension. Success depends on Ottoman resources, the competence of his commanders, and the responses of his many enemies.\n\nFactors Favoring Ottoman Success:\n\nOttoman military machine is experienced and professional\n\nJanissary corps remains formidable\n\nCentral position allows shifting forces between fronts\n\nEnemies are divided and distracted\n\nTruce with Castile secures one flank\n\nSultan personally capable and experienced\n\nFactors Working Against:\n\nBalanced expansion spreads resources thin\n\nBalkans are rugged and rebellious\n\nKaramanids have defied Ottomans for generations\n\nNaval construction competes with land forces for resources\n\nVenice and Genoa watch Ottoman naval growth with alarm\n\nHungary, though weakened, remains a threat\n\nConstantinople garrison reinforced by Latin knights\n\nWild Cards:\n\nWeather, plague, or famine\n\nUnexpected resistance or rebellion\n\nDeath or incompetence of key commanders\n\nIntervention by outside powers\n\nInternal Ottoman politics and rivalries\n\nd100: Success of Murad's Balanced Expansion (1435-1439)\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-5\nCatastrophic Overextension — The balanced strategy collapses. A major defeat in the Balkans or Anatolia cascades into crisis. Rebellions erupt. The fleet project stalls. Ottoman prestige plummets. Murad spends 1438-1439 desperately stabilizing rather than expanding. The empire is weaker than in 1435.\n6-10\nSignificant Setbacks — One front fails badly while others stagnate. Perhaps the Karamanids inflict a humiliating defeat, or Albanian resistance proves fiercer than expected. Naval construction behind schedule. Murad's careful strategy has not paid dividends.\n11-20\nMixed Results, Net Negative — Some successes, some failures, but the failures outweigh the gains. Resources expended without commensurate returns. The empire is no stronger than 1435, and some cracks have appeared in Ottoman control.\n21-35\nModest Progress — The strategy produces limited gains. Minor advances in the Balkans. Karamanids pressured but not crushed. Fleet grows slowly. The empire is slightly stronger, but Murad's patience has not yet been rewarded with decisive results.\n36-50\nSteady Advancement — The balanced approach works as intended. Meaningful gains on all fronts without overextension. Serbian vassalage tightened. Karamanid power reduced. Fleet notably larger. Ottoman position measurably stronger than 1435. The patient strategy vindicated.\n51-65\nStrong Success — Murad's methodical approach yields impressive results. Balkans increasingly secure—Albania subdued, Serbia firmly controlled. Karamanids suffer major defeat. Fleet at Gallipoli now substantial. The Sultan enters 1439 with momentum and confidence.\n66-75\nExcellent Progress — Every front advances beyond expectations. Balkan resistance crumbling. Anatolia pacified. Fleet approaching parity with regional Christian powers. Ottoman Empire significantly stronger. Murad positioned to escalate when the truce ends.\n76-80\nBalkan Dominance — Particular success in Europe. Serbia reduced to complete submission. Albania crushed. Bosnia trembling. Hungary's borders probed and found wanting. The Balkans are an Ottoman lake. Other fronts progress adequately.\n81-85\nAnatolian Triumph — The Karamanids finally broken. Other Anatolian beyliks submit or are absorbed. The Sultan's rear is entirely secure for the first time in generations. Resources can now flow westward. Balkans and fleet progress steadily.\n86-90\nNaval Surge — Gallipoli exceeds all expectations. The Ottoman fleet grows dramatically—dozens of war galleys, transport capacity for major amphibious operations. Venice grows alarmed. Control of the Aegean approaches. Balkan and Anatolian fronts stable.\n91-95\nComprehensive Success — Everything Murad attempted has succeeded. Balkans dominated, Anatolia secured, fleet powerful. The Ottoman Empire in 1439 is dramatically stronger than in 1435. The Sultan stands ready for major operations the moment opportunity presents.\n96-100\nStrategic Transformation — Murad's balanced expansion succeeds beyond all measure. The empire has grown in territory, military power, and administrative capacity. Vassals are loyal, enemies are cowed, the treasury is full. When the truce with Castile ends, the Ottomans will be ready for a confrontation that could reshape the Eastern Mediterranean.\n\nRoll when ready, Sicco.",

The Ottomans are in a stronger position than they were in 1435, which makes the crusade more challenging but also more urgent.\n\nOttoman Empire: Strong Success (1435-1439)\n\nIsaac's expression grows grave as he lays out the reports.\n\n\"The Sultan has used these four years well, Majesty. Too well.\"\n\nHe moves to the eastern map, marking positions as he speaks.\n\nThe Balkans\n\n\"Serbia is now firmly under Ottoman control. Despot Đurađ Branković rules only at Murad's pleasure—his fortresses are garrisoned by Ottoman troops, his treasury pays tribute, his sons are hostages at the Sultan's court. The silver mines of Novo Brdo fill Ottoman coffers.\"\n\nIsaac traces the Albanian coastline.\n\n\"Albania resisted fiercely, but the resistance has been broken. The great lords have submitted or fled. A few mountain strongholds hold out, but they are isolated, starving. By next year, even these will fall.\"\n\nHe taps the Hungarian border.\n\n\"Hungary is the only Balkan power that still stands independent. But King Albert—Sigismund's successor—died just last autumn. The Hungarian throne is contested. The kingdom fractures into factions. Murad watches, and waits, and probes.\"\n\nAnatolia\n\n\"The Karamanids have suffered a crushing defeat.\" Isaac's finger moves east. \"In 1437, Murad led a major campaign against Ibrahim Bey. The Karamanid army was shattered at the Battle of Akşehir. Ibrahim sued for peace on humiliating terms—territorial concessions, tribute, hostages.\"\n\nHe shakes his head.\n\n\"For the first time in generations, the Sultan's eastern flank is truly secure. The Anatolian beyliks have seen what happens to those who defy Ottoman power. They will not rise while Murad lives.\"\n\nThe Fleet\n\n\"And then there is Gallipoli.\"\n\nIsaac produces a separate report, marked with Venetian seals—intelligence purchased at considerable expense.\n\n\"The Ottoman fleet has grown substantially. My Venetian contacts count at least sixty war galleys now, with more under construction. Transport ships sufficient to move ten thousand men across the straits. The wharves work day and night.\"\n\nHe meets your eyes.\n\n\"The fleet is not yet a match for Venice, or for a combined Christian armada. But it is no longer negligible. If Murad chooses to contest the Aegean, he can now do so. If he chooses to blockade Constantinople from the sea while besieging it from land...\"\n\nHe lets the implication hang.\n\nSummary\n\nÁlvaro breaks the silence.\n\n\"So. The Sultan honored the truce—and used it to grow stronger on every front. Serbia subjugated. Albania crushed. The Karamanids broken. The fleet doubled or tripled.\" He looks at you. \"When you declared this truce, Majesty, you bought time for Constantinople. But Murad bought time too. And he has spent it well.\"\n\nLucia speaks quietly.\n\n\"The truce expires in 1445. Six years from now. If Murad continues at this pace...\"\n\n\"He will be ready to take Constantinople,\" Isaac finishes. \"The garrison you placed there—the Military Orders, the Latin settlers—they have bought years, not decades. Unless something changes, the city will fall within our lifetimes.\"\n\nÁlvaro turns to you.\n\n\"You spoke of striking first, Majesty. Of breaking the Sultan's fleet before he can use it. The intelligence suggests this is not merely ambitious—it may be necessary.\" He gestures at the map. \"Gallipoli is the key. Destroy the wharves, scatter the fleet, and you set Ottoman naval power back a generation. Fail, and you will have broken the truce for nothing—and face a Sultan who is stronger than he has ever been.\"\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\"What are your orders, Majesty?\"",

      "text": "1. **Hungary** - The most obvious ally, as they border the Ottomans directly. But Isaac just mentioned that King Albert died in autumn 1438 (historically this is accurate - Albert II of Habsburg died in October 1439, but the GM mentioned \"last autumn\" so in our timeline it might be slightly different). Hungary is in succession crisis.\n\n2. **Poland** - Poland and Hungary were sometimes united under one crown. Władysław III of Poland would historically become King of Hungary as well (Władysław III of Poland, also Ulászló I of Hungary). This is relevant.\n\n3. **The Papacy** - Pope Eugenius IV is already Juan's ally and has been supporting crusade efforts.\n\n4. **Venice** - Has commercial interests in the Eastern Mediterranean and would be threatened by Ottoman naval expansion. But Venice often preferred to trade with the Ottomans rather than fight them.\n\n5. **Genoa** - Similar to Venice, has colonies and trading posts in the region (including Galata across from Constantinople).\n\n6. **The Byzantine Empire** - Emperor John VIII is obviously on Juan's side, but has limited resources.\n\n7. **The Knights of Rhodes (Hospitallers)** - Already committed to Constantinople's defense per earlier chapters.\n\n8. **Serbia** - But Isaac just said Serbia is now firmly under Ottoman control.\n\n9. **Wallachia/Moldavia** - Orthodox principalities that sometimes resisted the Ottomans.\n\n10. **The Holy Roman Empire** - But it's weak and distracted by internal issues.\n\n11. **Burgundy** - We just established Philip is focused on the Low Countries and showed only commercial interest.\n\n12. **Aragon/Naples** - Alfonso V is Juan's cousin and ally, but his health is failing.\n\nLet me have the council discuss these options realistically. \n\nI'll craft strategic diplomatic approach tables to systematically evaluate potential alliance opportunities, focusing on key powers like Hungary and Poland that have the most strategic potential for a coordinated anti-Ottoman campaign.\n\nÁlvaro exchanges glances with Isaac, then moves to the larger map of Europe and the Mediterranean.\n\n\"A fair question, Majesty. A crusade is not won by one kingdom alone—not even one as powerful as Castile has become.\"\n\nHe begins pointing to various realms.\n\nThe Papacy\n\n\"Pope Eugenius IV is already your ally. He granted you the title Fidei Defensor, blessed your Constantinople expedition, and has labored for years to organize Christian resistance to the Ottomans. He will preach your crusade, grant indulgences, and pressure other princes to join.\"\n\nÁlvaro pauses.\n\n\"But the Pope commands no armies. His treasury is modest—the Camera reforms have helped, but Rome is not rich. What Eugenius offers is legitimacy, spiritual authority, and diplomatic weight. Valuable, but not soldiers.\"\n\nHungary\n\nIsaac steps forward.\n\n\"Hungary is the obvious ally, Majesty. They border Ottoman territory directly. For a century, Hungarian kings have been the shield of Christendom against the Turkish advance.\"\n\nHis expression darkens.\n\n\"But Hungary is in chaos. King Albert of Habsburg died last October—barely two years after succeeding Sigismund. His wife Elisabeth is pregnant, claiming the throne for her unborn child. The Hungarian magnates are divided—some support the Habsburg claim, others wish to elect a new king who can actually fight.\"\n\nHe consults his notes.\n\n\"The leading candidate is Władysław III of Poland. He is young—only fifteen—but the Poles are powerful, and a union of Poland and Hungary would create a formidable barrier against Ottoman expansion.\"\n\nÁlvaro nods slowly. \"If Władysław gains both crowns, he would have every reason to join a crusade. Poland and Hungary together could field perhaps forty thousand men—more if the nobility rally to the cause.\"\n\n\"But the succession is not yet decided,\" Isaac cautions. \"Elisabeth's child—if it is a boy—will have Habsburg support. Civil war is possible. We cannot count on Hungarian strength until we know who wears the crown.\"\n\nPoland\n\n\"Poland alone is substantial,\" Álvaro continues. \"The kingdom is large, populous, and has a strong military tradition. King Władysław—or rather, his regents, given his youth—have shown interest in crusading. Poland also has ties to Lithuania, which adds further strength.\"\n\nIsaac adds: \"The Poles have less direct interest in the Ottomans than Hungary—they face the Teutonic Knights to the north and various threats to the east. But a young king seeking glory might welcome a crusade. It would establish his reputation and unite his new subjects.\"\n\nVenice\n\n\"The Serene Republic is... complicated.\"\n\nÁlvaro's tone becomes careful.\n\n\"Venice has the greatest fleet in the Mediterranean. Their galleys control the Adriatic and much of the Aegean. They have colonies and trading posts throughout the East—Crete, Negroponte, numerous islands. Ottoman expansion threatens all of this.\"\n\n\"But Venice profits from Ottoman trade,\" Isaac interjects. \"They sell goods to the Sultan's domains, buy spices and silk that flow through Ottoman territory. War disrupts commerce. The Venetian Senate calculates in ducats, not souls.\"\n\nÁlvaro nods. \"Venice will join a crusade if they believe it will succeed and profit them. They will not sacrifice their ships for a hopeless cause. If Your Majesty can demonstrate strength—a real coalition, a real plan—Venice may commit. Otherwise, they will offer words and prayers while their merchants continue trading with the enemy.\"\n\nGenoa\n\n\"Genoa is Venice's rival and mirror,\" Isaac says. \"They too have Eastern colonies—Galata across from Constantinople, Caffa in the Crimea, various Aegean possessions. They too fear Ottoman expansion.\"\n\n\"Genoa is also weaker than Venice and more divided,\" Álvaro adds. \"The city is torn by faction. They may offer ships, but fewer than Venice, and with less reliability. Still, Genoese galleys and Genoese gold are not to be dismissed.\"\n\nThe Byzantine Empire\n\n\"Emperor John VIII will fight, obviously,\" Álvaro says dryly. \"Constantinople is his city—what remains of it. But Byzantium is a shadow. The Emperor commands perhaps three thousand soldiers. His treasury is empty without your subsidies. He offers the legitimacy of Roman tradition and the strategic position of the city itself. Nothing more.\"\n\nThe Knights of Rhodes\n\n\"The Hospitallers have already committed to Constantinople's defense,\" Isaac notes. \"Grand Master de Lastic sent one hundred fifty knights and two galleys in 1434. They will fight. But Rhodes itself must be defended—they cannot strip the island bare. Perhaps another hundred knights, a few more ships, if the crusade seems likely to succeed.\"\n\nThe Holy Roman Empire\n\nÁlvaro sighs.\n\n\"Emperor Frederick III is... not a crusader. He is young, cautious, and consumed by disputes with the Swiss, the Hungarians, and half the princes of Germany. The Empire is a patchwork of quarreling states. Frederick cannot command their obedience even if he wished to.\"\n\n\"Some German princes might join individually,\" Isaac offers. \"Knights seeking glory, younger sons seeking fortune. But do not expect Imperial armies, Majesty. The Empire will send prayers and perhaps a few hundred adventurers.\"\n\nAragon, Naples, and Sicily\n\n\"Your cousin Alfonso,\" Álvaro says carefully. \"He commands substantial forces—perhaps twenty-five thousand men across his three realms, plus a respectable fleet. He swore oaths of mutual aid. He is family.\"\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\"But Alfonso's health fails. His attention is fixed on Italy—consolidating Naples, managing Aragonese affairs, watching the Pope and Milan and Venice. The Mediterranean is his sea, but Constantinople is far from his immediate concerns.\"\n\nIsaac adds quietly: \"My agents report Alfonso grows weaker each year. The doctors speak of liver ailments, old wounds that never healed properly. He may not live to see 1445, let alone lead armies to the East.\"\n\nBurgundy\n\n\"We have already heard Don Fadrique's report,\" Álvaro says. \"Duke Philip admires Your Majesty but will not commit Burgundian knights to distant wars while Luxembourg and Liège occupy his attention. Perhaps gold, perhaps a token force for honor's sake. Nothing substantial.\"\n\nOthers\n\nIsaac considers.\n\n\"There are smaller powers, Majesty. Wallachia and Moldavia—Orthodox principalities between Hungary and the Ottomans. They have resisted Turkish domination, sometimes successfully. If Hungary marches, they may join.\"\n\n\"The King of Cyprus owes fealty to no one and fears the Ottomans greatly. A few hundred knights, perhaps ships.\"\n\n\"The King of Armenia—what remains of Armenian Cilicia—is desperate for any aid against Muslim encirclement.\"\n\n\"And there are always individual knights, adventurers, and zealots who will take the cross for glory, salvation, or gold.\"\n\nSummary\n\nÁlvaro steps back from the map.\n\n\"In sum, Majesty: The Pope will bless. Hungary and Poland may fight—if their succession crisis resolves favorably. Venice will calculate. Genoa will contribute modestly. The Byzantines and Hospitallers will defend what is theirs. Alfonso may help if he lives and can spare the attention. Burgundy and the Empire will send token gestures.\"\n\nHe meets your eyes.\n\n\"The core of this crusade will be Castilian. Your armies, your fleet, your gold. The question is whether you can gather enough allies to make the enterprise feasible—or whether you march east with only prayers and promises at your back.\"\n\nLucia speaks quietly.\n\n\"Perhaps we should know more about Hungary before committing. The succession there may determine whether this crusade has twenty thousand allies or none at all.\"\n\nShe looks at you.\n\n\"Shall we send envoys to Poland and Hungary, husband?

The user says it's been \"some years\" since Alfonso died and Juan has consolidated. \n\nI'm puzzled by the timeline discrepancy. Alfonso's health roll suggested he would live until 1444-1448, but the user indicates he died earlier. This seems like a potential narrative adjustment that requires clarification. The timing of Alfonso's death significantly impacts Juan's consolidation of power and military preparations.\n\nI'll proceed with calculating Juan's military forces based on the new narrative premise, treating Alfonso's earlier death as an established fact. A succession roll might help flesh out the details of how smoothly this transition occurred.\n\nGM Acknowledgment: Alfonso V has died and Juan II has inherited and consolidated his rule over Aragon, Naples, and Sicily. This is a major development.\n\nÁlvaro pauses, recalculating. The death of Alfonso—childless, as expected—has transformed Juan from a powerful king into the master of an empire stretching from the Atlantic to the central Mediterranean.\n\n\"Forgive me, Majesty. I still think in the old terms sometimes.\" He pulls fresh documents from the pile. \"Let us assess what you truly command.\"\n\nHe gestures to Diego de Daza, who has been quietly reviewing ledgers throughout the council session.\n\n\"Diego, the consolidated muster if you please.\"\n\nThe Crown of Castile\n\nDiego consults his records.\n\n\"Castile proper can raise forty-five thousand levies at full muster, Majesty. This includes León, Galicia, Asturias, Extremadura, Andalusia, and Murcia. The quality varies—the Andalusian veterans of the Granada war are excellent; the northern levies less experienced but hardy.\"\n\nHe turns a page.\n\n\"The Military Orders—Santiago, Calatrava, and Alcántara—provide four thousand five hundred knights and sergeants in total. However, approximately one thousand remain garrisoned in Constantinople at present. So three thousand five hundred available for new campaigns.\"\n\n\"Granada,\" he adds, \"contributes modestly. The conquered territory provides perhaps two thousand local levies—Mudéjar troops of uncertain loyalty, useful for garrison duty but not for crusade. We also maintain one thousand crown troops as permanent garrison.\"\n\nThe Crown of Aragon\n\n\"Aragon, Catalonia, and Valencia together,\" Diego continues. \"King Alfonso—God rest his soul—maintained careful records. The Crown of Aragon can field approximately fifteen thousand levies. The Catalans are stubborn fighters, well-equipped. The Valencians less reliable but numerous. Aragon proper provides excellent light cavalry.\"\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\"Alfonso also maintained a royal household guard of two thousand men-at-arms—professionals, well-trained. These have sworn to Your Majesty and remain intact.\"\n\nThe Kingdom of Naples\n\n\"Naples is more complicated, Majesty.\" Diego frowns at his figures. \"On paper, the feudal levy could produce twenty thousand men. In practice...\"\n\nÁlvaro interjects. \"The Neapolitan barons swore fealty to Alfonso, and have renewed those oaths to you. But their loyalty is to their own interests first. Perhaps ten to twelve thousand can be relied upon for offensive campaigns beyond Italy. The rest will find excuses.\"\n\nDiego nods. \"I concur with Don Álvaro's assessment. Twelve thousand as a working figure, with perhaps more if the campaign seems likely to succeed and offer plunder.\"\n\nThe Kingdom of Sicily\n\n\"Sicily provides six to eight thousand troops,\" Diego continues. \"Mostly infantry—crossbowmen, spearmen. Useful for garrisons and sieges. The Sicilian fleet is also significant, though we will address naval matters separately.\"\n\nConstantinople and the Eastern Garrison\n\nIsaac de Baeza speaks up.\n\n\"The Constantinople garrison currently numbers approximately one thousand Military Order soldiers—the force Your Majesty established in 1434, rotated and reinforced over the years. The Hospitallers from Rhodes have maintained their commitment of one hundred fifty knights and two war galleys.\"\n\nHe consults his notes.\n\n\"The Latin settlement program has also borne fruit. Perhaps three thousand adult male settlers now reside in Constantinople and its environs. They are not soldiers, but they can man walls and serve as militia in extremity. The Emperor's own Byzantine forces add another two to three thousand—poorly equipped but fighting for their homes.\"\n\nSummary of Land Forces\n\nDiego produces a summary sheet:\n\nRealm\nLevies\nProfessional/Elite\nNotes\nCastile\n45,000\n3,500 Military Orders\nCore strength\nGranada\n2,000\n1,000 garrison\nGarrison duty only\nAragon\n15,000\n2,000 household guard\nGood quality\nNaples\n12,000\n—\nReliability variable\nSicily\n7,000\n—\nInfantry focus\nConstantinople\n3,000 militia\n1,150 knights\nDefensive only\nTOTAL\n84,000\n7,650\n\nÁlvaro studies the figures.\n\n\"Eighty-four thousand levies on paper, Majesty. But you cannot call all of them—someone must defend the realms, maintain order, garrison the coasts. And transporting such numbers across the Mediterranean would require a fleet beyond anything Christendom possesses.\"\n\nHe taps the table.\n\n\"A realistic expeditionary force—one that can be transported, supplied, and commanded effectively—would be perhaps twenty to thirty thousand men. More if we commit everything and pray our enemies do not strike while we are away.\"\n\nThe Fleet\n\n\"Now, the naval strength.\" Álvaro gestures to Admiral Ataíde's reports.\n\n\"The combined Castilian-Portuguese fleet under the maritime union numbers approximately forty war galleys and twelve great carracks, plus numerous smaller vessels—caravels, supply ships, transports.\"\n\n\"The Aragonese-Sicilian fleet,\" Diego adds, \"contributes another thirty war galleys and eight carracks. Alfonso built well.\"\n\n\"And Genoa and Venice have ships in Eastern waters that might be persuaded to join—or at least not oppose—a crusade, if properly approached.\"\n\nIsaac summarizes:\n\nFleet\nWar Galleys\nCarracks\nNotes\nCastile-Portugal\n40\n12\nUnder Admiral Ataíde\nAragon-Sicily\n30\n8\nExperienced Mediterranean crews\nConstantinople (local)\n4\n2\nHospitaller vessels\nTOTAL\n74\n22\n\n\"Seventy-four war galleys and twenty-two carracks,\" Álvaro says. \"This is a formidable fleet, Majesty—larger than the Ottoman navy, though not by as much as we would like. Enough to contest the Aegean, protect transports, and threaten Gallipoli.\"\n\nThe Treasury\n\nDiego de Daza straightens with visible pride.\n\n\"The consolidated treasury of all Your Majesty's realms currently holds approximately one million two hundred thousand florins. The Granada silver mines alone add two hundred fifty thousand florins annually. Naples and Sicily contribute revenues of approximately one hundred eighty thousand florins per year. Aragon adds another ninety thousand.\"\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\"A major campaign—twenty thousand men for one year, plus naval operations—would cost approximately three hundred thousand florins. We can sustain such a campaign for three, perhaps four years without exhausting the treasury, assuming revenues continue.\"\n\nFinal Assessment\n\nÁlvaro folds his arms.\n\n\"In summary, Majesty: You command the largest military force in Western Christendom save only France. Your fleet is second only to Venice in the Mediterranean. Your treasury overflows. You can put twenty-five thousand men on ships and land them wherever you choose.\"\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\"The question is not whether you can fight the Sultan. The question is whether you can defeat him—and what allies you can gather to ensure victory rather than merely a brave defeat.\"\n\nLucia speaks softly.\n\n\"And what happens to five kingdoms if their king falls in battle on the other side of the world.\"",

      "text": "Juan is proposing to personally travel to Hungary and Poland to forge an alliance for the crusade against the Ottomans. This is a significant decision - a king leaving his realms to travel to distant kingdoms for diplomatic purposes.\n\nThe council will need to react to this. Let me think about who would say what:\n\nÁlvaro - He's cautious and practical. He'll have concerns about Juan leaving, but he's also seen Juan's personal diplomacy work before (Constantinople, Rome, etc.). He might support it but with conditions.\n\nLucia - She's already expressed concern about Juan going to war. Now he's proposing to travel even further. She'll be worried but she's also pragmatic and understands the necessity.\n\nIsaac - Will think about security, intelligence, logistics.\n\nDiego - Will think about costs.\n\nThe historical context:\n- Hungary is in succession crisis - King Albert died October 1439, his wife Elisabeth is pregnant\n- Władysław III of Poland is a candidate for Hungarian throne - he's about 15-16 years old\n- This is actually the lead-up to the Crusade of Varna (1444) historically\n\nJuan traveling personally would be unprecedented but also potentially very effective. He's shown he can win people over in person (Constantinople, the Pope, etc.).\n\nThe council should discuss:\n1. The risks of Juan traveling so far\n2. Who rules in his absence (Lucia as regent with Álvaro)\n3. The timing - the Hungarian succession is still uncertain\n4. The route and logistics\n5. What Juan can offer to seal the alliance\n\nI should have the council members react in character, raising both support and concerns. This is a major decision that deserves serious discussion.\n\nThe council falls silent. Álvaro's brow furrows deeply. Lucia's hand tightens on the arm of her chair. Even Isaac, usually impassive, shifts his weight.\n\nÁlvaro speaks first, slowly.\n\n\"You propose to travel to Hungary and Poland. Personally.\" He lets the words hang in the air. \"That is... a journey of two thousand miles, Majesty. Through the Empire, across lands you do not control, to kingdoms in the midst of succession crisis.\"\n\nHe moves to the map, tracing the route with his finger.\n\n\"Toledo to Barcelona. Barcelona to Genoa or Venice—by sea. Then overland through the Alpine passes, across Austria, into Hungary. Or north through the Empire to Poland first, then south to Buda.\" He shakes his head. \"Three months of travel each way, at minimum. Six months absent from your realms, assuming nothing delays you.\"\n\nDiego de Daza clears his throat.\n\n\"The cost would be substantial, Majesty. A royal progress through foreign lands requires an escort befitting your dignity—five hundred knights at minimum, plus servants, baggage, horses. Gifts for the Hungarian and Polish courts. Provisions for the journey. I would estimate fifty thousand florins, perhaps more.\"\n\n\"The cost is not the issue,\" Lucia says quietly. Everyone turns to her.\n\nShe rises from her chair, her grey-green eyes fixed on you.\n\n\"You are the King of Castile, León, Aragon, Naples, and Sicily. You are the Defensor Romaniae. You have six children, the eldest of whom is seven years old.\" Her voice is steady but tight. \"If you die on the road—bandits, disease, accident, treachery—five kingdoms fall into chaos. Fernando is a child. The nobles will tear each other apart fighting over the regency.\"\n\nShe steps closer.\n\n\"I said I would rule with Álvaro while you march to war. War I understand—it has purpose, it has end. But this?\" She gestures at the map. \"You propose to wander through half of Christendom, trusting your life to foreign roads and foreign princes, for the chance of alliance?\"\n\nIsaac de Baeza interjects, his tone carefully neutral.\n\n\"Her Majesty raises valid concerns, but there is another side to consider. King Władysław of Poland is fifteen years old. His councillors rule in his name. They will not commit Polish armies to a Castilian crusade based on letters and envoys—they do not know Your Majesty, they have no reason to trust Castilian promises.\"\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\"But if the King of five crowns rides into Kraków in person? If he sits with the Polish lords, speaks to them as equals, shows them the man who conquered Granada and saved Constantinople?\" Isaac shrugs. \"That is different. That is a king asking brother kings to ride with him. Men follow men, Majesty, not parchment.\"\n\nÁlvaro nods reluctantly.\n\n\"Isaac speaks truth. Your personal diplomacy has achieved what envoys could not—with the Pope, with the Emperor John, with King Duarte. Your presence matters.\" He sighs. \"But Lucia also speaks truth. The risk is enormous. If something happens to you...\"\n\nHe trails off, then straightens.\n\n\"If you are determined to go, Majesty, then we must minimize the risk. A strong escort—not just knights, but your shadow guard, your food tasters, men who can smell treachery before it strikes. A route through friendly or neutral territory. Letters of safe conduct from the Emperor, from Venice, from every prince whose lands you cross.\"\n\nHe looks at Lucia.\n\n\"And clear arrangements for the regency. Her Majesty and I can govern in your absence—we have done so before. But the Cortes must be informed. The great nobles must swear to uphold the regency. Everything must be in order before you depart.\"\n\nLucia's expression remains troubled, but she does not argue further.\n\nIsaac raises another consideration.\n\n\"There is also the question of timing, Majesty. Hungary's succession is not yet resolved. Queen Elisabeth's child—if it is a boy—will be the Habsburg candidate. Władysław is the Polish candidate. If you arrive while they are still fighting over the crown, you may find yourself entangled in their civil war rather than forging an alliance.\"\n\nHe consults his notes.\n\n\"Elisabeth's child should be born within weeks—perhaps it has already been born, and we simply have not received word. By summer, we will know whether it is a son or daughter, and whether Hungary will unite behind Władysław or fracture into factions.\"\n\nÁlvaro seizes on this.\n\n\"Then we wait for news before committing to the journey. If Władysław secures Hungary, you travel to meet a king who commands two realms. If Hungary fractures, you travel to meet only the King of Poland—still valuable, but less so.\"\n\nHe turns to you.\n\n\"What say you, Majesty? Do we wait for Hungarian news before deciding? Or do you wish to prepare for departure regardless?\"",

This is interesting - he's thinking about imperial symbolism, connecting himself to Byzantine/Greek Christian tradition as the Defensor Romaniae.\n\nI should answer his question directly and perhaps note the significance of what he's considering.\n\nÁlvaro tilts his head, intrigued by the sudden shift in topic. It is Lucia—educated in the classical traditions of the Italian courts—who answers first.\n\n\"Iota,\" she says. \"The Greek letter Iota—Ι. That is the first letter of Ἰωάννης, Ioannes.

An imperial council in Toledo with representatives from all five realms\n\nLet me think about how the council would react to each of these proposals.\n\nThe Iota coin:\n- This is essentially creating an imperial currency\n- Using the same weight as a florin is smart - it's already a recognized standard\n- The symbol is meaningful - connecting Juan to Constantine and the Greek/Roman imperial tradition\n- Having his face on coins is standard for monarchs\n- The design with the Iota as a pillar with three horizontal stripes is distinctive\n\nThe council members would have various reactions:\n- Diego de Daza (treasurer) would be interested in the practical aspects\n- Álvaro would see the political implications\n- Lucia might appreciate the elegance but worry about the symbolism\n- Isaac might note how other powers will react\n\nCrown marshalls - this was discussed before I believe, a way to have royal authority represented in each kingdom.\n\nThe imperial council - this is essentially creating a proto-parliament or advisory body for the entire empire. Representatives from Castile, Aragon, Sicily, Naples, and Constantinople. This is a major institutional innovation.\n\nLet me have the council react to these proposals thoughtfully, raising both support and concerns.\n\nThe council absorbs this in silence. Diego de Daza is already scribbling notes, his mind racing through the practical implications. Álvaro's expression shifts from surprise to careful consideration. Lucia watches you with an unreadable gaze.\n\nDiego speaks first, his voice eager.\n\n\"The mint in Granada is operational, Majesty. The Saxon engineers have established the infrastructure. We can begin striking coins within months of receiving the dies.\" He pauses, calculating. \"The silver production alone could mint... perhaps two hundred thousand Iotas in the first year. Gold is scarcer, but with the African trade, perhaps twenty thousand gold Iotas annually.\"\n\nHe looks up from his notes.\n\n\"A coin of Florentine weight will be accepted throughout the Mediterranean without question. Merchants know the florin. They trust it. An Iota of equal weight and purity becomes instantly exchangeable—but it bears your face, your symbol. Every transaction spreads your image and your authority.\"\n\nÁlvaro strokes his chin thoughtfully.\n\n\"The symbol itself is clever, Majesty. An Iota—the first letter of your name in Greek—but also the smallest letter of the Greek alphabet. Christ himself said, 'Not one iota shall pass from the law.' It suggests humility before God even as it proclaims imperial ambition.\"\n\nHe rises and moves to the window.\n\n\"But make no mistake—every prince in Christendom will understand what you are doing. You are not merely minting coins. You are declaring yourself Imperator. Emperor in all but name. The Pope may smile, for you are his champion. The Holy Roman Emperor will not smile at all.\"\n\nIsaac de Baeza adds quietly: \"Frederick III already styles himself Roman Emperor. He will see this as a challenge to his dignity—a Spanish king adopting Greek imperial symbolism, minting coins that rival Imperial currency. His protests will be loud, if ineffective.\"\n\n\"Let him protest,\" Lucia says, surprising everyone. She has been studying you intently throughout. \"Frederick rules a patchwork of squabbling Germans who ignore his commands. Juan rules five crowns with real armies and a full treasury. Symbols matter, but power matters more.\"\n\nShe turns to the others.\n\n\"My husband is not claiming Frederick's title. He is creating something new—or rather, something old. The Roman Empire of the East never recognized the Germans as legitimate successors to Rome. Constantinople still claims that mantle. And who is the Defensor Romaniae? Who pays the Emperor's pension? Who garrisons the city?\"\n\nHer eyes meet yours.\n\n\"The Iota is appropriate. But you should be prepared for what comes next. Once you mint these coins, once you raise this banner, you cannot retreat from what it implies. You are declaring yourself the protector—perhaps the successor—of Roman Christian civilization.\"\n\nÁlvaro turns to the matter of Crown Marshalls.\n\n\"This is wise, Majesty, and less controversial than the coinage. Each kingdom maintains its own laws, its own traditions, its own nobility. But a Crown Marshall in each realm—a representative of your personal authority who stands above local faction—provides unity without erasing local identity.\"\n\nHe counts on his fingers.\n\n\"A Marshall for Castile, one for Aragon, one for Valencia, one for Naples, one for Sicily, one for Granada... perhaps one for Constantinople as well, though Don Juan de Sotomayor already functions in that role.\"\n\nDiego interjects: \"The cost would be modest, Majesty. Each Marshall would require a household, a guard, administrative staff. Perhaps five thousand florins per Marshall annually. A small price for ensuring your commands are enforced consistently across all territories.\"\n\nThe proposal of a permanent imperial council draws the most intense reaction.\n\nÁlvaro sits back heavily.\n\n\"A council of the realms. Representatives from Castile, Aragon, Sicily, Naples, Constantinople—meeting permanently in Toledo to advise the crown on matters affecting the whole empire.\"\n\nHe is quiet for a long moment.\n\n\"This is... unprecedented, Majesty. The Cortes of Castile speaks for Castile. The Corts of Aragon speaks for Aragon. They have never sat together. They have different rights, different privileges, different jealousies.\"\n\nHe leans forward.\n\n\"If you summon such a council, you must decide: What authority does it hold? Does it merely advise, or can it bind? Can it vote taxes that apply across all realms? Can it make laws? Who selects the representatives—you, or the local Cortes?\"\n\nLucia nods slowly.\n\n\"The Italian states have experimented with such things. Florence has its councils, Venice its Senate. But those are single cities ruling territories. You propose to unite five kingdoms under one deliberative body while preserving their separate identities.\" She pauses. \"It could work. Or it could become a forum for endless grievance, each realm demanding precedence over the others.\"\n\nIsaac offers a practical consideration.\n\n\"The distances are vast, Majesty. A representative from Constantinople takes two months to reach Toledo. A Sicilian nearly as long. By the time they arrive, the matter they were summoned to discuss may have resolved itself—or become a crisis that cannot wait.\"\n\nHe shrugs.\n\n\"The council would need to be permanent—members residing in Toledo for extended periods, empowered to speak for their realms without constant consultation. That means men of significant authority, trusted by their home territories to make decisions in their absence.\"\n\nÁlvaro picks up the thread.\n\n\"And it means those men will become powerful in their own right. A Neapolitan lord who sits at the King's council in Toledo, who shapes policy for the entire empire—he becomes more than a mere representative. He becomes a figure of imperial significance.\"\n\nHe looks at you directly.\n\n\"This could be your greatest achievement, Majesty—a framework for governing an empire that outlasts any single king. Or it could be a nest of vipers, each representative scheming for his own kingdom's advantage at the others' expense.\"\n\nHe spreads his hands.\n\n\"How do you envision it functioning? What powers would this council hold? And how would you prevent it from becoming another battleground rather than a tool for unity?\"",

If a representative proves incompetent, or becomes a creature of faction rather than a servant of unity, you can send him home without offending his realm—they simply elect another.\" She tilts her head. \"But you should consider: what prevents a Cortes from sending the same man back? Or electing someone specifically to obstruct?\"\n\nIsaac de Baeza offers a quiet suggestion.\n\n\"Perhaps a term of service, Majesty. Three years, or five. After which the representative must return home, and the Cortes must elect someone new. This prevents any one man from becoming too entrenched, and ensures fresh perspectives over time.\"\n\nÁlvaro stops pacing.\n\n\"There is also the question of precedence. When these five representatives sit together, who speaks first? Who sits closest to the throne? The Castilian will expect primacy—Castile is the senior crown, your birthright. But the Aragonese will note that Aragon brought you Naples and Sicily. The Neapolitan will remind everyone that Naples is the largest kingdom by population. The Sicilian will invoke ancient Norman dignities. The Constantinopolitan...\"\n\nHe trails off with a dry smile.\n\n\"The Constantinopolitan will claim to represent the Roman Empire itself, and therefore outrank everyone.\"\n\nLucia laughs softly.\n\n\"Give them a round table, like the legends of King Arthur. No head, no foot. They sit as equals in your service.\"\n\nÁlvaro raises an eyebrow.\n\n\"Poetic. But someone must speak first.\"\n\n\"Then rotate,\" Lucia replies. \"Each meeting, a different representative opens the discussion. No permanent precedence. It is irregular, but so is an empire of five crowns ruled from Toledo.\"\n\nShe looks at you.\n\n\"This council needs a name, husband. Something that conveys its purpose without claiming more than it is. 'The Council of the Crowns' perhaps? Or 'The Council of Realms'? 'The Imperial Council' might provoke the German Emperor unnecessarily.\"\n\nÁlvaro adds: \"And it needs a formal charter—a document establishing its purpose, its limitations, its procedures. Something that can be read in every Cortes and court so there is no confusion about what you are creating.\"\n\nHe turns to you directly.\n\n\"Shall I draft such a charter for your review, Majesty? And shall we include this among the matters to present to the Cortes this year, alongside the succession arrangements and the new coinage?\"",

      "text": "The Alcázar of Toledo\n\nYou return to the great fortress-palace that has served as the seat of Castilian kings for centuries. It feels strange to walk these halls as a visitor rather than a resident—Casa de las Palomas has become home, with its gardens and its children's laughter. The Alcázar is something else now: a symbol, an instrument of government, a stage for imperial ceremony.\n\nThe building shows its age. Parts date back to the Visigothic kings; the Moors expanded it during their centuries of rule; your ancestors added towers and halls after the Reconquest. The result is a patchwork of styles—some magnificent, some merely functional, some cramped and dark.\n\nÁlvaro has summoned three men to attend you.\n\nMaestro Lorenzo de Palencia\n\nThe first is a Castilian, perhaps fifty years old, with mortar dust permanently embedded in the creases of his hands. He has supervised construction projects across the kingdom for three decades—churches, bridges, fortifications. He knows Castilian stone, Castilian workers, Castilian budgets.\n\n\"Majesty,\" he says with a bow. \"I have served your father and now serve you. The Alcázar is sound in its bones, but it has been added to without plan. Corridors lead nowhere. Windows face walls. Some chambers have not been opened in living memory.\"\n\nMaestro Giorgio di Montepulciano\n\nThe second is an Italian, younger—perhaps thirty-five—with the sharp eyes and quick hands of a Florentine trained in the new styles. He arrived in Castile last year as part of the Great Patronage Program, recruited from Lorenzo de' Medici's circle of artists and builders.\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" he says, his Castilian accented but fluent. \"I have studied the great palaces of Florence, Rome, and Milan. The principles of Brunelleschi and Alberti—proportion, light, harmony. A palace should not merely house a king; it should proclaim him.\"\n\nHe glances around the chamber with barely concealed assessment.\n\n\"There is much here that could be... refined.\"\n\nMaestro Willem van der Berg\n\nThe third is a Fleming, brought south by the wool trade connections. He is a specialist in practical matters—heating, drainage, the mechanics of large buildings. His people have learned to make the cold, damp north habitable; he brings that knowledge to Castile's hot summers and cold winters.\n\n\"Majesty,\" he says simply. \"Buildings must work before they can be beautiful. I concern myself with water, with air, with fire. The rest is decoration.\"\n\nÁlvaro gestures to the three men.\n\n\"I thought Your Majesty might benefit from different perspectives. Maestro Lorenzo knows what is possible here in Castile. Maestro Giorgio knows what is fashionable in Italy. Maestro Willem knows what is practical for daily use.\"\n\nHe produces a rough floor plan of the Alcázar, spread across a table.\n\n\"The palace currently contains the royal apartments—unused since Your Majesty moved to Casa de las Palomas—the great hall for audiences, the treasury chambers, various administrative offices, the chapel, kitchens, barracks for the household guard, and numerous storerooms and passages of uncertain purpose.\"\n\nHe looks at you.\n\n\"What do you envision, Majesty? A residence restored to glory? A working palace for government? Quarters for your new Council of the Realms? All of these? The architects await your direction.\"",

      "text": "2. **Maestro Giorgio di Montepulciano** (Florentine, artistic) - He would think about Renaissance principles - proportion, light, harmony. He might propose something inspired by classical Rome or the new Italian styles.\n\n3. **Maestro Willem van der Berg** (Flemish, practical/engineering) - He would think about infrastructure, water supply, drainage, heating - the practical requirements of a great capital.\n\nThe council members would also have opinions:\n- Álvaro would think politically - what message does this send?\n- Lucia might think about Italian examples\n- Isaac might think about security\n- Diego would think about cost\n\nLocation options:\n1. **Toledo** - Current capital, already established, but cramped on its hill and surrounded by the Tagus\n2. **Madrid** - Smaller town, but more central geographically, with room to expand\n3. **Granada** - The conquered city, symbolic of the Reconquista, but far south\n4. **A new site entirely** - Like Constantinople was built new, or like Philip II later built the Escorial\n\nThe Iota symbol should be central - perhaps a great monument or the layout of the city itself could incorporate it.\n\nThis is a massive undertaking - potentially comparable to Constantine building Constantinople, or the pharaohs building their cities. It would take decades and enormous resources.\n\nLet me have the architects and advisors respond thoughtfully, each from their perspective.\n\nThe three architects exchange glances. Maestro Giorgio's eyes light up with barely contained excitement. Maestro Lorenzo's face grows thoughtful, calculating. Maestro Willem simply nods, as if he had been expecting something of this magnitude.\n\nA profound silence settles over the council chamber.\n\nIt is Álvaro who speaks first, his voice careful.\n\n\"A new capital, Majesty. You speak of something that has been done... perhaps three times in Christian history. Constantine built his city on the Bosphorus. Charlemagne raised Aachen. The Moors built Córdoba from a provincial town into the jewel of Al-Andalus.\" He pauses. \"Each of those men commanded resources beyond measure. Each spent decades on the work. Each changed the world.\"\n\nHe does not say and each considered himself chosen by God, but the implication hangs in the air.\n\nLucia rises from her chair, moving to the window that overlooks Toledo—the ancient city sprawling across its granite promontory, the Tagus curling around it like a protective arm.\n\n\"My husband does not propose this lightly,\" she says quietly, addressing the architects as much as the council. \"Five crowns require a seat worthy of five crowns. What we have\"—she gestures at the Alcázar around them—\"was built for the kings of Castile alone. It cannot contain what this empire is becoming.\"\n\nShe turns back to the room.\n\n\"The question is not whether, but where and how.\"\n\nMaestro Lorenzo de Palencia steps forward first, the Castilian's practical mind already working.\n\n\"Majesty, Toledo has been the heart of Castile for centuries. The Visigoths crowned their kings here. The Church councils that defined our faith met here. The Moors called it Tulaytula and made it a seat of learning. When your ancestors reclaimed it, they reclaimed not just a city but a symbol.\"\n\nHe moves to the floor plan, tracing the terrain.\n\n\"But Toledo is constrained. The city sits on a rocky height, surrounded on three sides by the Tagus gorge. There is no room to expand outward—only upward, or by tearing down what already exists. The streets are narrow, suited to defense against Moorish raids, not to imperial processions. Water must be carried up from the river or collected in cisterns.\"\n\nHe straightens.\n\n\"If Your Majesty wishes to build within Toledo, we can rebuild the Alcázar, expand the cathedral, create grand plazas by clearing old quarters. But we will always be fighting the terrain. The city will never flow as a purpose-built capital might.\"\n\nMaestro Giorgio di Montepulciano can barely contain himself.\n\n\"Majesty, forgive my boldness, but—this is the opportunity of a thousand years.\"\n\nHe strides to the table, pulling parchment and charcoal from his satchel, already sketching as he speaks.\n\n\"In Florence, in Rome, we speak of città ideale—the ideal city. A city built not by accident of history but by design. Streets that radiate from a central point like rays of the sun. Buildings in proportion to one another, each serving its purpose, all serving the whole. Light, air, harmony.\"\n\nHis charcoal flies across the page.\n\n\"Your symbol—the Iota—it is perfect. A vertical stroke. A pillar. The city itself could embody this form.\" He sketches rapidly. \"A great central avenue, running north to south—the stroke of the Iota. At its heart, the three horizontal bars: three great plazas, one above another, connected by grand stairs. The lowest for the people and commerce. The middle for government and the Council of Realms. The highest for the throne and the cathedral—the crown of the city, closest to God.\"\n\nHe looks up, eyes blazing.\n\n\"And at the very center, where the vertical meets the horizontal—a monument. A great column, or an arch, or a tower. The Iota made manifest in stone. Visible from every quarter of the city. Visible from miles away. A beacon declaring: here is the heart of Christian empire.\"\n\nMaestro Willem van der Berg waits until the Italian's passion subsides, then speaks in his measured way.\n\n\"Dreams are well and good, Majesty. But cities are built on water and sewage, not visions.\"\n\nHe moves to the map of Castile that hangs on the wall.\n\n\"Before we speak of monuments, we must speak of rivers. A great capital requires water—for drinking, for industry, for fountains and gardens, for carrying away waste. Toledo has the Tagus, but the river runs in a gorge far below the city. Lifting water to the heights is expensive and limits growth.\"\n\nHis finger traces the map.\n\n\"If Your Majesty truly contemplates a new site, we must look for flat ground near reliable water. The confluence of rivers is ideal—multiple sources, natural drainage, ease of transport.\" He taps a spot. \"Here, for instance. Where the Manzanares flows near the small town of Madrid. Or here, where the Duero passes through Valladolid. Or in the south, where the Guadalquivir makes Seville a natural port.\"\n\nHe turns back to you.\n\n\"Tell me where the water is, Majesty, and I will tell you whether your architects' dreams can stand.\"\n\nThe three perspectives hang in the air—tradition, vision, practicality. The council members absorb them in silence.\n\nFinally, Álvaro speaks.\n\n\"There is also the question of message, Majesty. Where you build speaks as loudly as what you build.\"\n\nHe counts on his fingers.\n\n\"Toledo says: I honor the traditions of Castile; I build upon what my ancestors built. The Cortes would approve. The great houses would feel respected. But Aragon, Naples, Sicily, Constantinople—they might see it as proof that this empire is merely Castile wearing a larger crown.\"\n\nA second finger.\n\n\"Madrid says: I build something new, unburdened by history, at the geographic center of Iberia. It is a small town now—nothing. A blank canvas. But it is Castilian soil, which may displease the other realms just as much as Toledo.\"\n\nA third finger.\n\n\"Granada says: I build my capital on the site of my greatest victory, where the Cross triumphed over the Crescent. It is bold, symbolic, unmistakable in meaning. But it is far south, far from Aragon, far from France, far from the Atlantic trade. And the Mudéjar population might see it as a final humiliation—their greatest city remade into a Christian imperial seat.\"\n\nA fourth finger.\n\n\"A site on the coast—Barcelona, Valencia, or somewhere in the south—says: My empire looks outward to the Mediterranean, toward Constantinople, toward the crusade. But it places the capital at the edge of your domains rather than the center.\"\n\nHe lowers his hand.\n\n\"And there is one more option, Majesty, though it may seem strange to say aloud.\"\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\"Constantinople itself. The city you have sworn to defend. The Second Rome. If you defeat the Ottomans and secure the East... would you rule from Toledo? Or would you complete what Constantine began, and govern Christendom from the throne of the Caesars?\"\n\nThe question hangs in the air, immense and almost unspeakable.\n\nLucia's voice cuts through the silence.\n\n\"That is a decision for after the war, Álvaro. For now, my husband needs a capital that proclaims his empire here, in the West. A seat from which to launch the crusade, not a prize to be won by it.\"\n\nShe looks at you.\n\n\"What is your instinct, husband? Does your heart say Toledo, or somewhere new? The architects can build whatever you envision—but first you must envision it.\"",

Maestro Lorenzo nods with something like relief—Madrid is Castilian soil, close enough to Toledo that the transition will not shock the realm. Maestro Giorgio's eyes still burn with creative fire, already translating his città ideale onto this new canvas. Maestro Willem is studying the map, tracing the course of the Manzanares with his finger.\n\n\"Madrid,\" Maestro Lorenzo says slowly. \"A small town now—perhaps three thousand souls. It sits on a plateau above the Manzanares, with good sight lines in all directions. The Moors built a small fortress there—Mayrit, they called it. Your ancestors took it centuries ago, but it has never been more than a hunting lodge for Castilian kings and a stopping point on the road between Toledo and the north.\"\n\nHe strokes his chin.\n\n\"That is its advantage, Majesty. There is almost nothing there to constrain us. We build from nothing, according to plan.\"\n\nMaestro Willem speaks up.\n\n\"The Manzanares is not a great river—nothing like the Tagus or the Guadalquivir. But it is reliable, fed by snows from the Guadarrama mountains to the north. With proper engineering—aqueducts, cisterns, fountains—we can supply a city of fifty thousand, perhaps more.\" He pauses. \"The ground is good. Sandy soil over bedrock. It will bear heavy construction without sinking.\"\n\nMaestro Giorgio is already sketching furiously.\n\n\"The plateau is perfect for the Iota design. We orient the great avenue north to south—toward the mountains on one end, toward Toledo and the south on the other. The three plazas stack along this axis. At the center, the monument. The throne room and cathedral crown the highest point. The Cortes and Council of Realms occupy the middle plaza. The lower plaza opens to markets, guildhalls, the life of the city.\"\n\nHe looks up.\n\n\"But I have questions, Majesty, before I can draft a true plan.\"\n\nThe Architects' Questions\n\nMaestro Giorgio speaks first:\n\n\"The throne room and palace—how grand do you envision it? A fortress like the Alcázar, built for defense? Or a palace of light and air, like the new constructions in Florence and Milan, built to awe visitors with beauty rather than walls? And shall it include residential quarters for Your Majesty's family, or will you maintain Casa de las Palomas as your private residence?\"\n\nMaestro Lorenzo follows:\n\n\"The Cortes chambers—you mentioned separate rooms for each of the three estates: clergy, nobility, and commons. Shall these be within a single great building, or three separate structures around a common plaza? And how large? The Castilian Cortes has perhaps two hundred members when fully assembled. Do you anticipate this growing as the realm grows?\"\n\nMaestro Willem raises practical matters:\n\n\"Water and sanitation—shall I plan for fountains in every plaza, public baths in the Roman style, and sewers beneath the streets? These are expensive but transform a city from a place people endure to a place people love. Also, heating—Madrid's winters are cold, colder than Toledo. Shall we incorporate hypocausts in the major buildings, as the Romans did?\"\n\nMaestro Giorgio again:\n\n\"The cathedral—new construction, or do we bring craftsmen from Toledo to replicate its glories? A new cathedral could take fifty years to complete. Or we build a great royal chapel first—something magnificent but achievable in five to ten years—and leave the cathedral for future generations.\"\n\nMaestro Lorenzo:\n\n\"The Council of Realms—you spoke of representatives from five kingdoms meeting permanently. They will need not just a meeting chamber but residences, offices, staff quarters. A small palace in itself. Where along the avenue shall this sit? Near the throne, to show their importance? Or lower, to show they serve at your pleasure?\"\n\nMaestro Willem:\n\n\"Walls—shall Madrid be a walled city, or an open one? Walls constrain growth and cost enormously. But a capital without walls invites attack. Perhaps a compromise—a fortified palace and citadel, with the city itself open but designed so walls could be added later if needed?\"\n\nFinally, Maestro Giorgio asks the question clearly burning in his mind:\n\n\"The Iota monument at the heart of it all—what form shall it take? A great column, like Trajan's in Rome, carved with the deeds of your reign? An arch of triumph, like Constantine's? A tower that men can climb to see the whole city spread below? Or something never seen before—a pure geometric form, the Iota itself rendered in stone and gold, abstract and eternal?\"\n\nHe sets down his charcoal.\n\n\"Give us your vision, Majesty, and we will give you plans, costs, and timelines. Madrid can be built in stages—the bones first, then the flesh, then the ornament. Ten years for a working capital. Twenty for a great one. Fifty for something that will endure a thousand years.\"\n\nÁlvaro clears his throat.\n\n\"And the question beneath all these questions, Majesty: How much do you wish to spend? The treasury is full, but even a full treasury has limits. A modest capital—functional, dignified—might cost two hundred thousand florins over ten years. A great capital—the equal of any in Christendom—might cost a million or more over twenty years.\"\n\nHe spreads his hands.\n\n\"We can build everything the architects describe, or we can build the essentials now and leave the grandeur for your successors. What is your pleasure?\"",

But it can be done.\"\n\nMaestro Willem simply nods, his practical mind already calculating water pressure and drainage gradients.\n\n\"The Manzanares will suffice. I will make it suffice.\"\n\nThe Plan Takes Shape\n\nOver the following hours, the three architects work together—arguing, sketching, measuring, calculating. Álvaro, Lucia, and Diego de Daza observe as the vision takes form on parchment.\n\nFinally, as evening candles are lit, Maestro Giorgio rises and presents the synthesis of their work.\n\nTHE CITY OF MADRID: IMPERIAL PLAN\n\nOverall Concept\n\n\"The city will be built on the plateau above the Manzanares, oriented along a great north-south avenue—the Via Iota, if Your Majesty permits the name. This avenue will be sixty feet wide, paved in stone, lined with trees. It will run for nearly a mile, from the northern gates to the southern, with the three great plazas arranged along its length.\"\n\nGiorgio's sketch shows the layout clearly:\n\nNORTH (toward Guadarrama Mountains)\n        |\n   [Northern Gate]\n        |\n   [Lower Plaza - Markets, Guildhalls, Public Life]\n        |\n   [Middle Plaza - Cortes Building, Administrative Offices]\n        |\n   [Upper Plaza - Palace, Throne Room, Council of Realms, Royal Chapel]\n        |\n   [THE IOTA MONUMENT - at the highest point]\n        |\n   [Cathedral - behind the monument, crowning the city]\n        |\n   [Citadel - protecting the southern approach]\n        |\n   [Southern Gate]\n        |\nSOUTH (toward Toledo)\n\n\"The city rises as one walks south,\" Giorgio explains. \"The common people enter through the northern gate, into the bustle of markets and commerce. As they proceed, they climb—physically and symbolically—toward the seats of power. The Cortes. The Palace. And finally, at the summit, the Iota and the Cathedral. The journey through the city becomes a journey toward God and King.\"\n\nTHE BUILDINGS\n\n1. The Palace of Light (Palacio de la Luz)\n\nCost: 180,000 florins over 6 years\n\n\"We will build in the new Italian style,\" Giorgio says eagerly. \"Great windows of clear glass—we will need Venetian glaziers—flooding the interior with light. Arcaded courtyards open to the sky. Walls of white limestone that glow golden at sunset. No dark corridors, no cramped chambers. Every room will breathe.\"\n\nHe shows the floor plan:\n\nThe Throne Room: A great hall one hundred feet long, with a coffered ceiling thirty feet high. Windows on three sides. The throne on a raised dais at the southern end, so petitioners approach walking toward the light.\n\nThe Council of Realms Chamber: Adjacent to the throne room, connected by a grand archway. A round chamber with a domed ceiling—the round table Her Majesty suggested made architectural reality. Five great windows, one facing each cardinal direction and one in the dome itself, representing the five realms united under heaven.\n\nAdministrative Offices: Wings extending east and west from the main structure, housing the royal secretariat, treasury offices, and quarters for officials who must work late into the night.\n\nThe Royal Apartments: A private wing at the rear of the palace, overlooking gardens that descend toward the Manzanares. \"Like Casa de las Palomas,\" Giorgio says, \"but grander. A place for family, for children, for peace—yet connected to the seat of power by a single corridor. Your Majesty can move from private father to public king in thirty paces.\"\n\nMaestro Willem interjects: \"Hypocaust heating throughout the palace. Warm floors in winter. And a system of pipes to carry water to every level—fountains in the courtyards, running water in the kitchens and baths.\"\n\n2. The Cortes Building (Casa de las Cortes)\n\nCost: 85,000 florins over 4 years\n\nMaestro Lorenzo presents this design, his Castilian practicality shaping the concept:\n\n\"One great building, but organized so each estate has dignity and privacy. Three wings around a central courtyard:\"\n\nThe Clerical Wing: Seating for bishops, abbots, and cathedral chapters. Chapel attached for prayer before sessions. Sixty seats.\n\nThe Noble Wing: Seating for the great houses and lesser nobility. Decorated with the arms of every lineage represented. One hundred seats.\n\nThe Commons Wing: Seating for the representatives of the cities. Simpler decoration, but no less dignified. Ninety seats.\n\nThe Great Hall: Where all three estates gather for opening ceremonies, royal addresses, and final votes. A semicircular chamber with rising tiers of seats, focused on a central podium. Capacity for all 250 members plus observers in a gallery above.\n\n\"The acoustics will be designed so a speaker at the podium can be heard in every seat without shouting,\" Lorenzo adds. \"I have studied the Roman theaters. Sound can be shaped by architecture.\"\n\n3. The Royal Chapel (Capilla Real)\n\nCost: 45,000 florins over 3 years\n\n\"Small but perfect,\" Giorgio says. \"A jewel box for prayer. Seating for perhaps one hundred—the royal family, the household, honored guests. But every surface will sing with meaning.\"\n\nWalls of white marble inlaid with gold\n\nA great altarpiece depicting the Reconquista and the defense of Constantinople\n\nWindows of colored glass telling the story of salvation\n\nA choir loft for the singers Your Majesty has recruited through the Great Patronage Program\n\n\"This chapel will be complete within three years, Majesty. You will have a place to worship long before the great cathedral rises.\"\n\n4. The Cathedral of the Iota (Catedral del Iota)\n\nCost: 400,000 florins over 25-30 years (100,000 in first 10 years)\n\nMaestro Lorenzo speaks with reverence:\n\n\"This will be our life's work, Majesty. And the work of our sons after us. A cathedral to rival Burgos, Toledo, Seville. Perhaps to surpass them all.\"\n\nThe plan shows a cruciform structure oriented east-west:\n\nLength: 400 feet from western doors to eastern apse\n\nWidth: 150 feet across the transepts\n\nHeight: A central tower rising 300 feet—visible from twenty miles away\n\nCapacity: 5,000 worshippers\n\n\"We will build in stages. The foundations and lower walls in the first decade. The nave and aisles in the second. The transepts and choir in the third. The towers and final ornamentation... perhaps your grandchildren will see them completed.\"\n\n\"But from the first year,\" Lorenzo emphasizes, \"there will be a consecrated space for worship. A temporary roof over the choir, perhaps. The people of Madrid will see their cathedral rising around them, stone by stone, year by year. It will be a living testament to faith—always growing, never finished in any generation's lifetime.\"\n\n5. The Iota Monument (La Torre del Iota)\n\nCost: 120,000 florins over 8 years\n\nMaestro Giorgio presents this with particular passion:\n\n\"The heart of everything. The symbol made stone.\"\n\nHe shows a detailed sketch:\n\nThe Pedestal Base:\n\nA massive square structure, 100 feet on each side, 60 feet tall\n\nBuilt of white limestone reinforced with iron\n\nFour grand staircases, one on each face, leading to the summit\n\nInterior chambers for guards, storage, and the machinery of maintenance\n\nAt the top, a broad platform with views across the entire city and beyond\n\nThe Iota Tower:\n\nRising from the center of the pedestal, an additional 140 feet\n\nTotal height from street level: 200 feet\n\nThe shaft will be rectangular in cross-section—30 feet by 15 feet—unmistakably the vertical stroke of the letter\n\nAt the three horizontal bars of the Iota (bottom, middle, top), observation galleries will extend outward\n\nThe lowest gallery at 80 feet: views of the city\n\nThe middle gallery at 130 feet: views of the surrounding countryside\n\nThe highest gallery at 180 feet: on clear days, views of the Guadarrama mountains to the north and Toledo to the south\n\n\"The tower will be climbable from within,\" Giorgio continues. \"A spiral staircase of 400 steps. At each gallery level, visitors emerge onto platforms that extend horizontally—the bars of the Iota. From below, from any angle, the shape is unmistakable. Your symbol. Your initial. Your empire.\"\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\"And at the very top, above the highest gallery, a great golden cross. The Iota surmounted by the Cross of Christ. Faith above empire. God above king.\"\n\n6. The Citadel and Barracks\n\nCost: 90,000 florins over 5 years\n\nMaestro Lorenzo handles this design:\n\n\"A fortress within the city, but separated from it. South of the cathedral, on a slight rise, with clear fields of fire in all directions. Star-shaped walls in the modern style—angled to deflect cannon fire. Barracks for 2,000 soldiers. Armories. Stables. A well and cisterns to withstand siege.\"\n\n\"If Madrid is ever threatened,\" he says grimly, \"the royal family and government can retreat to the citadel and hold for months while relief is summoned.\"\n\nWillem adds: \"Independent water supply. Stores for six months. The citadel will be a city within a city—able to survive even if everything around it burns.\"\n\n7. Infrastructure\n\nCost: 180,000 florins over 10 years\n\nMaestro Willem presents the invisible work that makes a city function:\n\nAqueduct: Bringing water from the Guadarrama foothills, fifteen miles away. \"The Manzanares will serve for industry and irrigation, but drinking water should come from the mountains. Cleaner. Healthier.\"\n\nFountains: Twelve public fountains along the Via Iota and in the major plazas. \"No one in Madrid will walk more than five minutes to find clean water.\"\n\nSewers: Underground channels carrying waste to the Manzanares downstream of the city. \"The Romans understood this. A city without sewers is a city of plague.\"\n\nPaving: All major streets paved in stone. Secondary streets in compacted gravel. \"Mud breeds disease and discontent. Paving breeds pride.\"\n\nStreet Lighting: Oil lamps at major intersections, maintained by a city watch. \"Madrid will not sleep when the sun sets. The Via Iota will glow at night.\"\n\n8. The Royal Residence (Casa del Rey)\n\nCost: 50,000 florins over 4 years\n\n\"Your Majesty requested a home like Casa de las Palomas, but within the city,\" Giorgio says. \"We propose to build it within the palace grounds but separate from the Palace of Light itself—connected by a covered walkway, but with its own gardens, its own entrance, its own peace.\"\n\nPrivate apartments for the King and Queen\n\nNurseries and schoolrooms for the children\n\nGardens with fruit trees, fountains, and space for play\n\nA private chapel for family devotions\n\nQuarters for personal servants and the shadow guard\n\n\"From the outside, it will appear part of the palace complex. From the inside, it will be a home.\"\n\nBUDGET SUMMARY\n\nBuilding/Project\nCost (Florins)\nTimeline\nPalace of Light\n180,000\nYears 1-6\nCortes Building\n85,000\nYears 2-5\nRoyal Chapel\n45,000\nYears 1-3\nCathedral (first phase)\n100,000\nYears 1-10\nIota Monument\n120,000\nYears 2-9\nCitadel and Barracks\n90,000\nYears 1-5\nInfrastructure\n180,000\nYears 1-10\nRoyal Residence\n50,000\nYears 3-6\nSUBTOTAL\n850,000\nContingency and Overruns\n150,000\nArtisans, Materials Transport, Labor Camps\n250,000\nTOTAL\n1,250,000\n10 Years\n\nINSPIRED ADDITIONS\n\nMaestro Giorgio hesitates, then speaks:\n\n\"Your Majesty invited us to share inspired ideas, even if they exceed the budget. I have three.\"\n\nFirst: The Gallery of Crowns\n\n\"A hall within the palace displaying the symbols of every realm you rule. The crown of Castile. The crown of Aragon. The crown of Naples. The crown of Sicily. The throne of Constantinople—or a replica, if the original cannot be moved. Visitors would walk through the history of how these realms came together under one sovereign. Maps, tapestries, trophies of war, treaties of peace. A monument to unification.\"\n\nAdditional cost: 25,000 florins\n\nSecond: The Avenue of Kings\n\n\"Along the Via Iota, between the plazas, statues of every King of Castile from Pelayo to Your Majesty. Perhaps forty figures in all, carved in white marble, each twice life size. Visitors would walk through a thousand years of history to reach the living king at the avenue's end.\"\n\nAdditional cost: 60,000 florins\n\nThird: The Garden of Nations\n\n\"Behind the palace, a great garden divided into five sections—one for each realm. Castilian oaks and olive trees. Aragonese vines. Neapolitan citrus. Sicilian palms. Byzantine cypresses. Each section designed by gardeners from that realm, planted with species native to that land. A living symbol of the empire's diversity within unity.\"\n\nAdditional cost: 15,000 florins\n\nMaestro Lorenzo adds his own suggestion:\n\nFourth: The Hall of the Faithful\n\n\"Within the cathedral, a chapel dedicated to those who died defending Constantinople. Their names inscribed on the walls. A place where their sacrifice is remembered forever. The knights who fell. The sailors who drowned. The settlers who gave their lives for Christendom.\"\n\nAdditional cost: 20,000 florins\n\nMaestro Willem, not to be outdone, offers a practical inspiration:\n\nFifth: The Royal Baths\n\n\"Public baths in the Roman style, but heated year-round by the hypocaust system. One for men, one for women, one for the royal household. Cleanliness, health, and a gift to the common people. The Moors understood this. We should not abandon wisdom simply because it came from infidels.\"\n\nAdditional cost: 30,000 florins\n\nThe three architects stand back from their work, exhausted but exhilarated.\n\nGiorgio speaks for all of them:\n\n\"This is our vision, Majesty. A city that proclaims your empire. A city that will endure. Tell us what pleases you and what does not, and we will refine until it is perfect.\"\n\nÁlvaro studies the plans with a mixture of awe and calculation.\n\n\"If you approve this, Majesty, we should announce it at the Cortes. Let them see what their king is building. Let them understand the scale of your ambition—and the permanence of your rule.\"\n\nLucia stands beside you, looking at the sketches of the Royal Residence.\n\n\"A home within a city,\" she says softly. \"The children will grow up watching an empire being built around them.\"\n\nShe looks at you.\n\n\"What do you think?\"",

And I want it to be a place where sacrifice is remembered, but especially a secrifice for the benefit of others. We are the shield against the dark.

I would like a hall commemorated to this, yes.\n\n\nI also require a royal treasury inside the citadel I think.

Room for other buildings - commercial district, banks, etc. - these don't need to be crown-funded\n6. Palace administration space - marshalls, tax assessors need room\n\nI should have the architects respond to these points and confirm the final plan, maybe with adjusted budget.\n\nThe architects nod, making notes as you speak.\n\nMaestro Willem looks pleased about the baths.\n\n\"The Roman tradition preserved, Majesty. I will design them to draw heat from the same hypocaust system that warms the palace. Efficient and magnificent.\"\n\nMaestro Lorenzo's eyes brighten at your words about the Hall of the Faithful.\n\n\"A hall commemorating sacrifice for others. The shield against the dark.\" He bows his head. \"This is not merely architecture, Majesty. This is theology made stone. I will design it with that spirit—a place where men come to remember why we fight, why we give, why we die for things greater than ourselves.\"\n\nHe pauses thoughtfully.\n\n\"Perhaps we place it not within the cathedral, but as a separate chapel connected to the citadel. Those who defend the realm—the soldiers, the knights—would pass through it on their way to duty. A daily reminder of what they serve.\"\n\nThe Royal Treasury\n\nDiego de Daza straightens at the mention of the treasury.\n\n\"A wise precaution, Majesty. The treasury currently resides in the Alcázar of Toledo, in vaults built by the Moors. Secure enough, but not designed for the scale of wealth you now command.\"\n\nMaestro Lorenzo makes a quick sketch.\n\n\"We will build vaults beneath the citadel—deep into the bedrock. Multiple chambers with iron doors, each requiring separate keys held by different officials. The walls lined with stone so thick that no tool could breach them in less than a week of constant work.\"\n\nMaestro Willem adds: \"And we design against fire, flood, and treachery. Drainage channels to prevent water accumulation. No wooden beams that could burn. A single entrance, easily guarded, with a killing corridor should anyone attempt forced entry.\"\n\nDiego nods approvingly.\n\n\"The cost?\"\n\nLorenzo calculates quickly. \"Perhaps fifteen thousand florins additional, incorporated into the citadel construction. The walls are already being built strong; we simply extend them downward.\"\n\nRoom for Growth\n\nMaestro Giorgio spreads his hands over the city plan.\n\n\"Majesty, we are designing the bones of Madrid—the great avenue, the plazas, the principal buildings. But a city is more than bones. It is flesh, blood, breath. And that grows organically.\"\n\nHe traces the areas between the main structures.\n\n\"Here, along the lower plaza, we leave space for commercial buildings. Guildhalls. Banks. Merchant houses. Warehouses. These will be built by the guilds and merchants themselves, to standards we establish—height limits, setbacks from the street, approved materials. They pay for construction; the crown collects rents on the land.\"\n\nHe moves his finger to side streets branching from the Via Iota.\n\n\"Residential quarters here. Noble townhouses closer to the palace—lords will want to build near the seat of power. Middling houses for officials and wealthy merchants further out. Common housing beyond that. Again, private construction on crown land, following our plan.\"\n\nLorenzo nods.\n\n\"A city of fifty thousand within twenty years, Majesty. Perhaps one hundred thousand within fifty. The infrastructure we build now—the water, the sewers, the streets—will support that growth. And every building that rises adds to the crown's rental income.\"\n\nWillem adds practically: \"We should establish a building code from the first day. Maximum heights. Minimum street widths. Fire separation between structures. Required connections to the sewer system. Madrid will not become another maze of narrow alleys and fire traps like the old cities. It will be planned.\"\n\nThe Palace Administration\n\nMaestro Giorgio returns to the palace floor plan.\n\n\"The wings extending east and west from the throne room, Majesty—I mentioned administrative offices, but let me be more specific.\"\n\nHe sketches additional detail:\n\nEast Wing:\n\nOffices of the Royal Treasury (working offices, not the vault)\n\nChambers for the Crown Marshalls when they attend court\n\nMeeting rooms for tax assessors and revenue officials\n\nArchive rooms for financial records\n\nQuarters for senior clerks who must work through the night\n\nWest Wing:\n\nOffices of the Royal Secretariat\n\nChambers for the Council of Realms representatives (working space, not residences)\n\nMeeting rooms for diplomatic functions\n\nArchive rooms for correspondence and treaties\n\nQuarters for scribes and translators\n\n\"Each wing can accommodate perhaps fifty officials working simultaneously,\" Giorgio explains. \"With the Council of Realms chamber adjacent to the throne room, and the administrative wings extending outward, your entire government operates within a few minutes' walk.\"\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\"The representatives of the Council of Realms will need residences as well—but those can be private houses near the palace, built at their own realms' expense. We simply reserve appropriate plots along the streets nearest the upper plaza. Prestigious addresses for prestigious men.\"\n\nBanking District\n\nIsaac de Baeza, who has been listening quietly, speaks up.\n\n\"Regarding banks, Majesty—the Medici have expressed interest in establishing a branch in your realms. If Madrid becomes your capital, they will want a presence there. As will the Genoese bankers, the Venetians, perhaps even the Fuggers from Augsburg.\"\n\nHe glances at the commercial district on the plan.\n\n\"A cluster of banking houses near the lower plaza would serve well. Close to the markets, close to the guildhalls, but with easy access up the Via Iota to the palace when matters require royal attention.\"\n\nDiego de Daza adds: \"We might consider a Lonja—a commercial exchange, like those in Barcelona and Valencia. A grand building where merchants and bankers conduct business under one roof. The crown builds it; the merchants pay fees to use it. It becomes self-sustaining within a few years.\"\n\nLorenzo nods. \"Perhaps thirty thousand florins for a proper Lonja. But as Don Diego says, the fees would recover that cost over time.\"\n\nRevised Budget\n\nDiego de Daza tallies the additions:\n\nAddition\nCost (Florins)\nRoyal Baths\n30,000\nHall of the Faithful\n20,000\nTreasury Vaults (citadel)\n15,000\nCommercial Exchange (Lonja)\n30,000\nAdditional Total\n95,000\n\n\"This brings our total to approximately 1,345,000 florins over ten years, Majesty,\" Diego reports. \"Well within your means, given current revenues. And the Lonja, at least, will generate returns.\"\n\nHe hesitates, then adds:\n\n\"If I may, Majesty—the Granada silver mines alone produce 250,000 florins annually. The entire Madrid project, spread over ten years, consumes roughly half of that single revenue stream. You will still accumulate wealth even as you build. By the time Madrid is complete, the treasury will be larger than it is today, not smaller.\"\n\nFinal Confirmation\n\nÁlvaro surveys the complete plan spread across the table.\n\n\"Then we have it, Majesty. A new capital. A throne room and palace. A Cortes building. A royal chapel and a great cathedral begun. The Iota monument. A citadel with treasury vaults. Infrastructure for a great city. Baths. A Hall of the Faithful. Space for growth—commercial, residential, institutional.\"\n\nHe looks at you.\n\n\"Shall I instruct the architects to prepare final drawings and detailed budgets? We can present the vision to the Cortes when they gather—show them what their king is building, invite them to elect their first representative to the Council of Realms, and settle the succession arrangements all in one great session.\"\n\nLucia speaks softly.\n\n\"You should give it a name, husband. Not just 'Madrid.' A new city deserves a new name—or at least a title. 'Madrid, Capital of the Crowns.' 'Madrid, Seat of the Iota.' Something that declares what it is.\"\n\nShe pauses.\n\n\"Or perhaps you keep it simple. Just 'Madrid.' Let the city speak for itself. Let men see what you have built and understand without being told.\"\n\nShe looks at you expectantly.\n\n\"What shall we call it?\"",

Stone platform extending outward from the central tower shaft forming one of the horizontal bars of the Iota letter. Iron railings with decorative crosses, a golden weathervane visible above. Visitors in medieval Spanish dress gazing out in wonder - a nobleman pointing toward distant mountains, his wife clutching his arm, children pressing against the railings, a monk kneeling in prayer, a scholar with instruments measuring the horizon. Through the openings, a breathtaking panoramic view of Madrid spread below - the Via Iota as a pale ribbon, the three plazas, tiny figures in the streets, red tile roofs, the cathedral under construction, and beyond the city the golden plains of Castile stretching to the Sierra de Guadarrama mountains under brilliant blue summer sky.

Long wooden tables where contracts are signed, scales for weighing gold and silver, strongboxes being carried by servants. Against the walls, small offices and counting rooms behind iron grilles where the great banking houses - Medici, Fugger - conduct their affairs. A public crier announcing commodity prices from a raised platform. The air thick with the murmur of negotiation in multiple languages, the clink of coins, the scratch of quills.

Style of Dutch Golden Age market scenes, Pieter de Hooch interiors, warm afternoon light --ar 16:9 --v 6.1\n\n\n\nTips for Interior Scenes:\n\n\nLighting is crucial - interiors benefit from:\n\n\n\"volumetric light\" or \"god rays\" for dramatic window light\n\n\"candlelit\" for warmer, more intimate scenes\n\n\"chiaroscuro\" for dramatic contrast\n\nAdd atmosphere:\n\n\n\"dust motes in sunlight\"\n\n\"incense smoke\"\n\n\"warm ambient glow\"\n\nFor more photorealistic results, add:\n\n\n\"architectural photography\"\n\n\"wide angle lens\"\n\n\"interior design magazine\"\n\nFor more painterly results, add:\n\n\n\"oil painting masterwork\"\n\nReference specific artists known for interiors (Vermeer, Velázquez, Van Eyck)\n\nConsistency tip: If you get a great result, note the --seed number and use it with the other prompts to maintain similar lighting and style across all interiors.\n\n\nWould you like me to create prompts for any other specific spaces—perhaps Juan's private chambers in the Casa del Rey, or the Hall of the Faithful?",
