Read the most recent chapter summaries to understand where we are\n\nLet me start by searching the project knowledge and reading the necessary files.\n\nThis is very comprehensive. Now let me read the NPC guide to make sure I understand how to handle NPCs properly, and then I'll check if there's a Kingdom guide.\n\n**Timeline:** The last chapter ended on July 4, 1434 after the triumphant victory at Aversa and Naples. Key current events:\n\n1. **Naples Campaign Complete:** René of Anjou surrendered (roll 97 - Surrender with Gratitude), Queen Joanna II formally named Alfonso V her heir\n\n2. **Constantinople Situation:**\n- 715 Military Order soldiers remain under Don Juan de Sotomayor\n- Hospitaller reinforcement (150 men, 2 galleys) committed\n- Emperor John VIII liberated and acting independently\n- Notaras executed; treasury enriched\n\n3. **Personal:**\n- Lucia (Juan's second wife/Queen) is approximately 6 months pregnant, settled at Palazzo Caracciolo in Naples\n- Child expected late August/September 1434\n- Alfonso sworn as regent for Castile and Defensor Romaniae if Juan dies\n\n4. **Ottoman Situation:**\n- Sultan Murad II received Juan's letter requesting a meeting\n- Response: Cautious Engagement (Roll: 50) - agrees a meeting 'may' be possible; conditions to be discussed through intermediaries\n- Juan expected to receive the Sultan's reply late June/early July\n\nWait - I see something confusing in the character database. It mentions Isabel of Portugal and Catalina in Toledo (April 1433), but the Chapter 2.27 summary is about July 1434 with Lucia as pregnant. Let me search for more context about Lucia and Isabel.\n\nLooking at the summaries - it seems like Isabel died or there was a remarriage to Lucia d'Este. Let me search for more info about this.\n\nThe userMemories mention \"wife Queen Lucia d'Este and young daughter Princess Catalina\" - so Lucia is now queen. Isabel must have died at some point. The campaign has clearly progressed significantly.\n\nI'll investigate the Kingdom guide to clarify the timeline and relationships, focusing on understanding the transition from Isabel to Lucia and the current political landscape.\n\nVictory hangs in the summer air like the scent of orange blossoms. Three days ago, René of Anjou's army surrendered at Aversa—a desperate cavalry charge broken against Castilian steel, followed by French soldiers weeping with relief as they laid down their arms. Yesterday, Queen Joanna II named Alfonso V her heir before the assembled nobility of Naples. The Calabrian barons knelt; the French claimant departed with his honor intact but his ambitions extinguished.\n\nThe Kingdom of Naples is secure.\n\nNow Juan finds himself in that strange pause between crises—the brief calm that medieval kings learn to distrust. Lucia, six months heavy with child, rests at the Palazzo Caracciolo, her sharp tongue only slightly dulled by the summer heat. The 800 crusaders who marched from Granada to Rome to Basel to Rhodes to Constantinople to Naples wait for their next purpose. Alfonso V, newly confirmed as Joanna's heir, is already turning his considerable energy toward the administrative work of claiming his prize.\n\nAnd somewhere across the Adriatic, Sultan Murad II considers a Castilian king's unprecedented request for a meeting.\n\nThe Sultan's reply—cautious engagement, agreeing that a meeting \"may be possible\"—was dispatched weeks ago. Intermediaries have been discussed. Conditions remain to be negotiated. That response should arrive any day now, if it hasn't already reached the port.\n\nThe outstanding threads:\n\nThe Ottoman Question: What conditions will the Sultan propose? What does Juan actually hope to achieve in a meeting with the most powerful Muslim ruler in the world?\n\nConstantinople: 715 Military Order soldiers hold the walls under Don Juan de Sotomayor. The Hospitaller reinforcement (150 men, 2 galleys) is committed. Emperor John VIII acts independently but gratefully. The city holds—for now.\n\nLucia: Expected to deliver in late August or September. Juan promised to be present. That promise constrains his movements.\n\nThe Return: Castile awaits its king. Fernando and Catalina grow without their father. The administrative apparatus Álvaro built continues to function, but a kingdom can only run on momentum for so long.\n\nThe Succession: Alfonso has sworn a sacred oath to serve as regent and Defensor Romaniae if Juan falls. The houses of Castile and Aragón are bound as one blood, one purpose.\n\nThe morning light streams through the windows of whatever chamber Juan occupies. Naples stirs outside—a city suddenly certain of its future after months of siege and uncertainty.\n\nWhat does the King of Castile do this fourth day of July, in the year of our Lord fourteen hundred and thirty-four?",

      "text": "1. **Historical Context:**\n- Alfonso is the brother of the deceased Infantes Juan and Enrique (who rebelled against Juan and died in rebellion)\n- Alfonso was initially a potential threat who might defend his brothers\n- Juan sent a diplomatic letter in October 1430 seeking partnership\n- Alfonso was interested but cautious initially\n\n2. **Juan's Support for Alfonso:**\n- October 1433: Alfonso visited Toledo for Fernando's baptism, brought Emperor John VIII's letter\n- Juan gave unconditional support for Naples campaign:\n  - 40,000 florins for hiring Francesco Sforza\n  - Naval support from Castile's new carracks\n  - Diplomatic pressure on Genoa and Milan\n  - Fleet of 4 armed carracks to anchor at Valencia\n- Alfonso departed \"deeply grateful for the unconditional support\"\n\n3. **Te Deum (April 1433):**\n- Three-kingdom alliance concept discussed\n- Juan offered to advocate for Alfonso's Naples claim to Pope\n- Juan offered Castilian military forces for Naples campaign\n- Alfonso providing naval transport and supply capability\n- Succession arrangement: Juan offered to name Alfonso as heir if no son\n- Agreed to wait until after Rome to formalize\n\n4. **Naples Campaign (June-July 1434):**\n- Juan came to Naples with 15,000 Castilian soldiers\n- Alfonso had been holding Naples against René's siege\n- Alfonso swore the sacred oath (Roll: 100) to be regent and Defensor Romaniae if Juan dies\n- Battle of Aversa - decisive victory\n- René's army surrendered (Roll: 97)\n- Queen Joanna named Alfonso heir (Roll: 84)\n\n5. **Alfonso's Character Development:**\n- Experienced profound humbling from Naples disasters (Battle of Ponza)\n- Spiritual crisis: recognized twelve years chasing glory for pride\n- Witnessed young guard die protecting him\n\n- Ready to redirect from Italian obsession to Iberian cooperation\n\nI see Juan is proposing a bold strategic alliance. He wants to create a unified military command that spans multiple kingdoms, leveraging Alfonso's recent military successes and their growing trust. The proposal aims to transform their personal relationship into a comprehensive geopolitical partnership, extending beyond Naples to include Byzantine, Castilian, Leonese, Aragonese territories. This represents a transformative moment in their diplomatic relationship.\n\nThe key challenge is balancing Alfonso's newfound sovereignty with Juan's vision of collective defense. While Alfonso has already committed to a sacred oath and familial bonds, he'll be cautious about surrendering independent military authority. Juan must carefully negotiate, highlighting mutual benefits and shared spiritual purpose of defending Christendom.\n\nSuccess hinges on their deep personal connection, recent military achievements, and shared commitment to crusading ideals. The potential risks include Alfonso's pride and desire to consolidate his recent conquests. Careful diplomacy will be essential to navigate these complex political and personal dynamics.\n\nThank you for the correction on the crusaders. Let me search for any additional context on the relationship and then draft the table.\n\nWhat Juan is asking now:\n- Formal binding of Aragon and Naples to the Defensor arrangements\n- Unified military command for crusading purposes under Juan\n\nThis is significant but builds on a very strong foundation. Alfonso has already committed to this in the event of Juan's death (the sacred oath). The question is whether he'll formalize it NOW while Juan is alive.\n\n**Success Factors:**\n- Alfonso literally owes his kingdom to Juan (decisive military intervention)\n- Sacred oath already sworn (Roll: 100 - extraordinary)\n- Three-kingdom alliance concept already discussed and agreed in principle\n- Spiritual transformation - Alfonso redirecting from pride to purpose\n- Family bonds (married to Juan's sister)\n- Succession already essentially shared\n- The approach is respectful - asking for consideration, not demanding\n\n**Failure Factors:**\n- Alfonso just won Naples - he might want to consolidate first\n- Aragonese nobles might have concerns about sovereignty\n- Even grateful kings don't like giving up command authority\n- \"What exactly does this mean in practice?\" - details matter\n- Alfonso has his own ambitions and priorities\n- Timing question - is now the right moment?\n\nGiven the extraordinary Roll: 100 sacred oath and the depth of Juan's recent service to Alfonso (literally winning his kingdom), this should be a favorable roll table. But Alfonso is still a king with his own interests - he won't simply roll over.\n\nThe diplomatic approach needs nuanced refinement. I'll analyze the negotiation's subtle dynamics, focusing on crafting a proposal that addresses potential reservations while highlighting mutual strategic advantages. The key is providing Alfonso with clear, tangible benefits beyond his existing commitments, ensuring he sees this as an opportunity rather than a constraint.\n\nANALYSIS: ALFONSO V'S PERSPECTIVE\n\nWhat Juan has done for Alfonso:\n\nOctober 1433: 40,000 florins for hiring Sforza (unconditional)\n\nOctober 1433: Fleet of 4 armed carracks as show of force\n\nOctober 1433: Diplomatic pressure on Genoa and Milan\n\nApril 1433: Advocated for Naples claim to Pope Eugenius IV\n\nJune-July 1434: 15,000 Castilian soldiers transported to Naples\n\nJuly 2, 1434: Decisive battle at Aversa—broke René's army with Castilian blood\n\nJuly 4, 1434: Witnessed Queen Joanna name Alfonso heir\n\nWhat Alfonso has already committed:\n\nRoll: 100 Sacred Oath: \"If you fall, I will be father to your children and guardian to your kingdoms. I will defend Constantinople as if it were Zaragoza. I will carry the cross east and make war upon the infidel until my last breath.\"\n\nSuccession arrangement discussed at Te Deum (agreed to formalize after Rome)\n\nThree-kingdom alliance concept already accepted in principle\n\nWhat Juan is now asking:\n\nExtend the Defensor arrangements to include Aragón and Naples NOW\n\nUnified military command structure for crusading operations under Juan\n\nNot just \"if Juan dies\" but active coordination while Juan lives\n\nSUCCESS FACTORS (persistent across all roll levels)\n\nBlood Debt: Alfonso owes his kingdom to Castilian intervention—this is undeniable\n\nSacred Oath Already Sworn: The Roll: 100 oath already committed him to the Defensor role in contingency\n\nFamily Unity: Juan's sister María is Alfonso's queen; they are brothers in every meaningful sense\n\nSpiritual Transformation: Alfonso's humbling at Ponza reoriented him from pride to purpose\n\nShared Succession: They are already each other's heirs in practice\n\nThe Logic: If Alfonso is committed to defend Constantinople after Juan's death, why not coordinate effectively while Juan lives?\n\nFAILURE FACTORS (persistent across all roll levels)\n\nFresh Crown: Alfonso literally just became Naples' heir—consolidation requires attention\n\nSovereignty Concerns: Placing kingdoms under another king's command, even for crusading, has implications\n\nAragonese Court: His own nobles and advisors will have opinions about this\n\nPractical Questions: \"Command\" is abstract—what does this mean in specific situations?\n\nTiming: Is this the moment for constitutional arrangements, or should Naples stabilize first?\n\nPride (residual): Even transformed men retain some royal pride\n\nAPPROACH EVALUATION\n\nStrengths:\n\nRespectful framing (\"I was hoping you would consider\")\n\nAcknowledges Alfonso's role as regent and heir\n\nAppeals to shared purpose and opportunity\n\nBuilds on existing commitments rather than demanding new ones\n\nWeaknesses:\n\nVague on practical details—what exactly does \"command\" mean?\n\nDoesn't address what Alfonso gains beyond what he's already committed to\n\nNo face-saving mechanism if he wants to negotiate terms\n\nTiming not addressed—why formalize now rather than after consolidation?\n\nApproach Quality: Solid but not exceptional. The relationship does most of the work here, not the specific argument.\n\nD100 TABLE: Alfonso's Response to Defensor Expansion\n\nRoll\nResult\nDescription\n1-5\nOffended Refusal\nAlfonso's pride—dormant but not dead—flares. \"I knelt and swore to guard your children. I did not swear to become your vassal.\" He reminds Juan that Aragón has never bent knee to Castile. The timing feels like exploitation of his gratitude. He needs time to cool before the relationship can recover. Failure factors dominate completely; success factors dismissed as manipulation.\n6-15\nTroubled Deflection\nAlfonso grows uncomfortable. \"You have done everything for me, and now you ask this...\" He doesn't refuse outright but raises substantial concerns: his Aragonese nobles would never accept formal subordination; Naples needs his full attention; the Pope hasn't even confirmed his claim yet. He asks to revisit this after Naples is secure—perhaps a year or two. Failure factors raised earnestly; success factors acknowledged but insufficient.\n16-30\nCautious Negotiation\nAlfonso nods slowly but his expression is guarded. \"The principle is sound. We are one house, one purpose. But 'command' is a heavy word between kings.\" He proposes a lesser arrangement: formal coordination and consultation, mutual defense obligations, joint war councils—but stops short of placing Aragonese forces under Castilian command. He wants partnership, not hierarchy. Mixed result; both factor sets present; genuine negotiation required.\n31-50\nConditional Agreement\nAlfonso accepts the concept but insists on defining terms. \"I will bind Aragón and Naples to the Defensor arrangements—but as partner, not subordinate.\" He proposes: joint command councils where both kings must agree on major operations; either king may call on the other's forces for crusading purposes; neither may commit the other's forces without consultation. A true alliance of equals rather than unified command. He wants this documented carefully. Success factors resonate; failure factors raised constructively.\n51-70\nWarm Acceptance with Clarification\nAlfonso's face softens. \"You won me my kingdom. You ask me to help you defend Christendom. How could I refuse?\" He accepts the Defensor framework but asks practical questions: Who commands when both kings are present? How are costs shared? What obligations fall on Naples specifically? He wants to understand the details, but his agreement is genuine. \"Draft the documents. I will sign them.\" Success factors dominate; failure factors become mere practical concerns.\n71-85\nEnthusiastic Embrace\nAlfonso grips Juan's arm. \"I wondered when you would ask. I've been waiting.\" He reveals that since swearing the sacred oath, he's been thinking about exactly this—how to make their alliance operational rather than merely sentimental. He has ideas: Aragonese shipyards could build galleys for Constantinople; Naples could serve as staging point for Eastern operations. \"We are not two kings anymore. We are one purpose with two crowns.\" Success factors embraced fully; failure factors dismissed as irrelevant.\n86-95\nProfound Commitment\nAlfonso's eyes glisten. The man who wept at Ponza, who watched a guard die for his pride, who swore before God to carry the cross—that man speaks now. \"When you knelt before Pope Martin and offered everything to God, I thought you were mad. When you conquered Granada, I thought you were lucky. When you came to Naples with fifteen thousand men...\" He pauses. \"I understand now. This is not politics. This is calling.\" He will not merely join the Defensor arrangements—he will champion them to his own nobles, to the Pope, to anyone who questions. Extraordinary resonance; success factors become personal conviction.\n96-100\nSacred Renewal\nAlfonso drops to one knee—again. \"I swore once to guard your children if you fell. Let me swear again.\" His voice carries the weight of a man transformed. \"While you live, while I live, let Aragón and Naples stand with Castile as one sword for Christ. Not because you saved my kingdom—that is debt, and debts can be repaid. But because what you are building is what I should have been building for twelve wasted years.\" He proposes not just acceptance but expansion: formal documents binding both kingdoms, presented to the Pope for blessing, proclaimed throughout Christendom. The House of Trastámara united in purpose eternal. Complete alignment; the alliance transcends politics entirely.\n\nGM Notes:\n\nGiven Alfonso's Roll: 100 sacred oath three weeks ago, his spiritual transformation, and Juan's decisive military intervention for Naples, this table is weighted favorably. The failure factors are real but the relationship has accumulated extraordinary goodwill.\n\nThe approach is competent but not brilliant—it relies heavily on the existing relationship rather than making a particularly compelling new argument. A more detailed proposal addressing Alfonso's practical concerns might have shifted the ranges upward.\n\nReady to roll when you are.",

      "text": "Remember: I must NOT generate any dialogue or actions for Juan. I stop after Alfonso speaks and let the player respond.\n\nCAUTIOUS NEGOTIATION\n\nRoll: 23 — Partnership, Not Hierarchy\n\nThe morning finds Alfonso in the smaller council chamber of Castel Nuovo—the room he has already begun to think of as his, though Queen Joanna still breathes in her apartments above. Maps of southern Italy cover the table, marked with the positions of Calabrian lords whose loyalty remains to be tested. A half-eaten breakfast sits forgotten beside correspondence bearing seals from Barcelona, Valencia, Sicily.\n\nHe looks up as Juan enters, and his face transforms—genuine warmth, the smile of a man who owes everything to the man before him. He rises, clasps Juan's arm in the warrior's grip they have shared since the night march to Aversa.\n\n\"Juan. Sit, please. Wine? It's Sicilian—not as good as Castilian, I'm told, though I've never believed that particular claim.\"\n\nHe listens as Juan speaks of the Defensor arrangements, of binding the kingdoms together, of unified command for the defense of Constantinople and the inevitable conflict with the Ottomans. His expression shifts as Juan continues—not hostile, but thoughtful. Guarded. The warmth remains, but something else enters his eyes.\n\nWhen Juan finishes, Alfonso is silent for a long moment. He turns to the window, looking out over the bay where Castilian and Aragonese ships ride at anchor together.\n\n\"You have done everything for me,\" he says finally, his voice quiet. \"Everything. The florins when I needed them. The fleet. The diplomacy. Fifteen thousand men who marched through the night and broke René's army while I watched from walls I could not leave.\" He turns back. \"I knelt and swore before God to be father to your children and guardian to your kingdoms. I meant every word. I still mean them.\"\n\nHe moves to the table, his fingers tracing the coastline of southern Italy on the map.\n\n\"The principle is sound. We are one house, one purpose—I believe that. But...\" He pauses, choosing his words with care. \"'Command' is a heavy word between kings, Juan. Even between brothers.\"\n\nAlfonso meets Juan's eyes directly.\n\n\"If I place Aragón and Naples under Castilian command for crusading purposes—even with my full consent, even with joy in my heart—what do my nobles see? What does the Pope see? What does history record?\" He shakes his head slowly. \"They see the Crown of Aragón subordinated to Castile. They see a king who won his kingdom with another king's army and then... surrendered his sovereignty in gratitude.\"\n\nHe raises a hand before Juan can respond.\n\n\"I am not refusing. I am not even reluctant in my heart. But I have nobles in Barcelona who have never forgiven my Italian obsessions. I have Sicilian barons who fear absorption into a greater power. I have a kingdom I have not yet actually held—Joanna lives, and until she dies and I am crowned, I am heir, not king.\" He gestures at the maps. \"And these Calabrian lords who knelt two days ago? Half of them supported René. They are watching to see what kind of king I will be. If my first act is to place my crown beneath another...\"\n\nAlfonso sighs, running a hand through his hair.\n\n\"What I can offer—what I want to offer—is this: formal coordination. Joint war councils where we plan together as equals. Mutual defense obligations—an attack on Constantinople is an attack on all three kingdoms. Shared intelligence, shared costs, shared purpose.\" His voice firms. \"But when Aragonese soldiers march, an Aragonese commander leads them. When Neapolitan ships sail, they sail under my authority. We fight together, Juan. Not with you commanding and me following.\"\n\nHe steps closer, his expression earnest.\n\n\"Is that not enough? We are already each other's heirs. We are already bound by blood and oath and gratitude beyond measure. Must we also have one crown above the other? Can we not be... partners? Two swords wielded by one purpose, rather than one sword with two handles?\"\n\nThe King of Aragón waits for his brother's response.",

      "text": "Juan is pivoting well here. He's:\n1. Accepting Alfonso's counter-proposal gracefully (\"Of course, we are partners\")\n2. Acknowledging Alfonso's practical concerns about consolidation\n3. Offering help (Crown Marshals system)\n4. Making a more specific, practical request: naval transport for Constantinople operations\n\nThis is a much more concrete ask than \"unified command\" - it's asking for ships, not sovereignty. Let me think about how Alfonso would respond to this.\n\n**Alfonso's perspective on this new request:**\n\nSUCCESS FACTORS:\n- Much more specific and limited than \"command\"\n- Doesn't threaten sovereignty - lending ships is normal between allies\n- Alfonso just benefited enormously from Castilian help\n- The sacred oath already commits him to Constantinople's defense\n- Naval transport is exactly what Aragón can provide (they have the Mediterranean fleet)\n- Juan is being gracious about the earlier pushback\n\nFAILURE FACTORS:\n- Alfonso is about to consolidate two kingdoms - he needs his fleet\n- 100,000 men is an enormous claim - is this realistic?\n- \"Lend me your fleets\" during consolidation could leave him vulnerable\n- The timing is still awkward - Naples isn't even formally his yet\n- His nobles ARE tired of fighting - committing the fleet means more war\n\nPRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS:\n- How many ships?\n- For how long?\n- Who pays for crews, supplies, maintenance?\n- What if Alfonso needs them during consolidation?\n- When would this operation happen?\n\nThis is a negotiation, not a persuasion roll moment. Alfonso will respond to this specific request with practical questions and conditions. He's already shown he wants to help but needs details.\n\nI should play Alfonso as genuinely trying to find a way to say yes while protecting his own interests. He's not being obstructionist - he's being a responsible king who just got handed a kingdom he needs to hold.\n\nLet me write his response - this should be relatively short since it's continuing dialogue, and I should stop after he speaks to let Juan respond.\n\nAlfonso's shoulders relax visibly at Juan's words. The tension that had crept into his posture—the worry that his refusal of unified command might have wounded the relationship—drains away.\n\n\"Partners,\" he repeats, and the word carries weight. \"Yes. That is what we are.\"\n\nHe listens to Juan's counsel about rebellious nobles, nodding slowly. \"Crown Marshals. Álvaro has written to me about this system—how you've brought the great houses to heel without war, through law and accountability rather than the sword.\" A rueful smile. \"I could use such a system. The Calabrians who knelt two days ago will test me within the year. I know this. They are watching to see if the new king is weak.\"\n\nWhen Juan turns to the matter of fleets, Alfonso's expression becomes calculating—not resistant, but practical. The merchant-prince of Barcelona considering logistics.\n\n\"One hundred thousand men,\" he says slowly. \"You truly believe the Sultan would commit such a force?\"\n\nHe moves to the map table, tracing the sea lanes from Naples to Constantinople.\n\n\"The Aragonese fleet... at full strength, perhaps sixty galleys, twenty larger vessels. Sicily adds another thirty galleys. Naples...\" He pauses, considering. \"René's fleet is scattered or captured. Perhaps fifteen serviceable ships once we've sorted through the harbor. But crews are another matter—many fled or died during the siege.\"\n\nAlfonso straightens, meeting Juan's eyes.\n\n\"I can lend you ships. For the defense of Constantinople, for transport of armies, for whatever you need against the Ottoman.\" He raises a finger. \"But I need to understand the timing. When do you envision this great operation? This year? Next? Five years hence?\"\n\nHe gestures at the map of southern Italy.\n\n\"If you need the fleet this autumn, I cannot give it—I must secure my coasts, show strength to the Calabrians, ensure René's remnants do not return with French reinforcements. But if you speak of next year, or the year after...\" He nods slowly. \"Then yes. We can plan. We can coordinate. The fleet of Aragón-Naples will carry Castilian armies east when the hour comes.\"\n\nHis voice softens.\n\n\"Tell me what you are truly planning, Juan. Not the vision—I know the vision. But the plan. When do you expect the Sultan to move? What forces do you intend to gather? Where will they assemble?\"\n\nA slight smile crosses his weathered face.\n\n\"I have learned, these past months, that you do not speak of things lightly. If you say one hundred thousand Ottomans, you have reason to believe it. Share that reason with me, and we will find a way to answer it together.\"",

He's a sophisticated military mind who has fought campaigns (even if unsuccessfully at Ponza)\n3. He's now committed to this alliance\n4. He would have practical questions and perhaps concerns about such an ambitious plan\n5. He knows the Ottoman threat from Mediterranean experience\n\nJuan's plan:\n- Build Constantinople's strength over coming years\n- Train army and militia\n- Repair walls\n- When Sultan sieges, come with relief force\n- In 5 years, launch campaign through Hungary + attack from city to retake Anastasian wall (the outer wall of Constantinople's landward defenses, or perhaps he means the Long Walls of Thrace?)\n\nThis is a massive undertaking. Alfonso would:\n- Be impressed by the scope\n- Have practical questions\n- Potentially offer advice or resources\n- Want to understand his role\n- Perhaps caution about the difficulty\n\nI should play Alfonso as genuinely engaged but with practical medieval military/political thinking. He's not going to just agree to everything - he'll have thoughts.\n\nThe Anastasian Wall (or Anastasian Long Wall) was built in the 5th century, running from the Black Sea to the Sea of Marmara about 65km west of Constantinople. It was meant to protect Thrace. By the 15th century it was largely in ruins and not militarily relevant. Juan might be using this as shorthand for \"push the Ottomans back from Constantinople's immediate vicinity\" or he might be thinking of the Theodosian Walls.\n\nActually, I should let Alfonso respond naturally. He would:\n1. Appreciate being trusted with the full plan\n2. Have thoughts about the Hungarian route\n3. Consider Naples' role\n4. Perhaps have knowledge of Ottoman capabilities\n5. Offer what he can commit to\n\nI'll craft a response that reflects his strategic mind and genuine partnership with Juan, balancing enthusiasm with pragmatic medieval royal diplomacy.\n\nAlfonso listens intently, his military mind working through the implications. When Juan finishes, he nods slowly—not the nod of a man agreeing to please, but of one genuinely processing strategy.\n\n\"Five years,\" he murmurs. \"Yes. That makes sense. The Sultan cannot conjure one hundred thousand men from nothing either. He must gather them, supply them, move them.\" He traces an invisible line across the map table. \"And every year Constantinople grows stronger is a year he loses advantage.\"\n\nHe pulls a chair closer and sits, gesturing for Juan to join him.\n\n\"The Hungarian route...\" Alfonso's brow furrows. \"János Hunyadi. You have corresponded with him, yes? I have heard of this man—the voivode who actually wins against Ottoman armies. If anyone knows how to campaign through the Balkans, it is him.\" He pauses. \"But Hungary is fractured. The nobles squabble while the Turk watches. Can Hunyadi deliver a unified Hungarian force, or only his own Transylvanian levies?\"\n\nHe leans back, fingers steepled.\n\n\"The Anastasian Wall... you mean to push the Sultan back from Thrace entirely. Not merely defend Constantinople, but reclaim the approaches.\" A low whistle. \"That is not defense, Juan. That is reconquest. That is driving the Ottoman from Europe.\"\n\nAlfonso is silent for a long moment, weighing something.\n\n\"In five years, Naples will be secure. My fleet rebuilt, my nobles cowed or won. Sicily prosperous. Aragón at peace.\" He meets Juan's eyes. \"When that day comes—when you march through Hungary and sail to Constantinople—I will be there. Not just my ships. Me. Alfonso of Aragón, fighting beside you.\"\n\nHis voice drops.\n\n\"I wasted twelve years chasing Italian glory for pride. If God grants me the chance to spend the next twelve fighting for something that matters...\" He leaves the thought unfinished, but his meaning is clear.\n\n\"What of the Pope? Basel? Do they support this vision?\"",

This is a much simpler ask than unified command - it's logistical cooperation, the kind of thing allies routinely grant each other.\n\nGiven:\n1. Alfonso just said he wants to fight beside Juan when the time comes\n2. He's already committed to the Defensor arrangements in principle\n3. He owes Juan his kingdom\n4. This is a modest ask compared to what Juan initially proposed\n5. The roll was 23, which was \"Cautious Negotiation\" - he wants partnership not hierarchy, but he's not hostile\n\nThis should be an easy yes. The only possible concerns would be:\n- Timing (making sure it doesn't interfere with consolidation)\n- Practical details (who pays for supplies, billeting, etc.)\n- Making sure Castilian armies don't become occupation forces\n\nBut fundamentally, this is a reasonable request that Alfonso should accept readily. I don't need a roll for this - it's a logical consequence of the alliance they've been discussing and well within what Alfonso has already indicated he'd support.\n\nLet me write Alfonso's response - warm acceptance with perhaps a few practical questions or conditions about how this would work.\n\nAlfonso actually laughs—a short, warm sound of genuine amusement.\n\n\"Juan, you just won me my kingdom with fifteen thousand men who marched through my roads and sailed into my ports.\" He spreads his hands. \"You ask if you may do again what you have already done? Of course. A thousand times, yes.\"\n\nHe rises, moving to a side table where wine and cups wait. He pours two measures of the Sicilian red and brings one to Juan.\n\n\"Naples will provision your armies. Sicilian granaries will feed your soldiers. Aragonese shipyards will repair your vessels. When the hour comes and Castilian banners march east, every port from Barcelona to Taranto will open to them.\" He offers the cup. \"This I can promise without hesitation, without condition, without consultation with any noble or council.\"\n\nHe raises his own cup.\n\n\"To the roads and ports of Aragón and Naples—open to the armies of Castile, now and always, for as long as our houses endure.\"\n\nAfter drinking, Alfonso sets down his cup and his expression turns more businesslike.\n\n\"We should formalize this. A treaty of free passage and mutual support—something my nobles can see, something that binds future generations.\" He pauses. \"Not unified command, but... coordinated purpose. The terms we discussed. Joint councils, shared intelligence, mutual defense, and now free passage for crusading armies.\"\n\nHis eyes meet Juan's steadily.\n\n\"Draft it. I will sign it. And when you return to Castile, bring it before your Cortes as I will bring it before mine. Let it be known throughout Christendom that the crowns of Castile, Aragón, and Naples stand as one against the enemies of the faith.\"\n\nA slight smile.\n\n\"Is there anything else you need from me before I begin the tedious work of actually ruling this kingdom you won for me?\"",

      "text": "Juan is asking Alfonso to commit to contributing forces to the Constantinople defense/Ottoman war, but with the understanding that Alfonso has flexibility during the consolidation period. This is a reasonable request that builds on what they've already discussed.\n\nLet me think about Alfonso's perspective:\n\n**What Juan is asking:**\n- Formal commitment that Aragón and Naples will contribute \"what they can\" when the Ottoman conflict comes\n- Acknowledgment that Alfonso needs time to consolidate (which Juan has already granted)\n- This is essentially putting in writing what Alfonso has already verbally committed to\n\n**Success factors:**\n- Alfonso already said \"When that day comes... I will be there. Not just my ships. *Me*.\"\n- This is vague enough (\"what they can\") to give Alfonso flexibility\n- It acknowledges his consolidation needs\n- It's a natural extension of what they've already agreed\n\n**Failure factors:**\n- \"Contribute what they can\" could be interpreted very broadly or very narrowly\n- Alfonso's nobles might resist an open-ended military commitment\n- What if Naples needs its forces for its own defense?\n- What counts as \"the fight is taken to the Ottomans\"? If Juan starts an aggressive war, is Alfonso obligated?\n\n**Alfonso's likely response:**\nGiven the roll of 23 (Cautious Negotiation), Alfonso has been cooperative but careful about sovereignty and practical concerns. He's already committed verbally to being there personally in five years. But putting it in a treaty is different from verbal promises.\n\nHe would likely:\n1. Ask for clarification on what \"contribute what they can\" means\n2. Want some limitation on when this triggers (defensive vs. offensive)\n3. Want to ensure he retains judgment on what his kingdoms \"can\" contribute\n4. Possibly want mutual obligations (Castile helps if Aragón is attacked)\n\nThis doesn't require a roll - it's negotiation following from the earlier roll. Alfonso is in \"cautious negotiation\" mode, which means he's cooperative but wants details nailed down.\n\nAlfonso pauses, the wine cup halfway to his lips. He sets it down carefully.\n\n\"'Contribute what they can,'\" he repeats slowly, testing the words. \"That is... deliberately vague, is it not?\"\n\nHe's not hostile—his tone is thoughtful, probing.\n\n\"I have already told you I will be there personally when the hour comes. I meant it. But putting words in a treaty that my nobles and my Cortes will read...\" He exhales. \"They will ask questions. What does 'what they can' mean? Who decides what Aragón can contribute? If Naples faces rebellion, can I withhold forces? If Sicily is threatened by Tunisian pirates, must I still send ships east?\"\n\nAlfonso drums his fingers on the table.\n\n\"And there is the matter of when this obligation triggers. If the Sultan attacks Constantinople, that is clear—defensive war, sacred duty, no one could object. But if you take the fight to the Ottomans...\" He raises an eyebrow. \"If you march through Hungary to reclaim Thrace, that is offensive war. Glorious, righteous, but offensive. My nobles will ask: are we obligated to join a war of your choosing, at a time of your choosing?\"\n\nHe holds up a hand before Juan can respond.\n\n\"I am not refusing. I am telling you what questions will be asked, so we can answer them in the document itself.\" He leans forward. \"What if we phrase it thus: Aragón and Naples commit to the defense of Constantinople and to supporting military operations against the Ottoman Empire, with contributions determined by consultation between the crowns based on the capacity of each kingdom at the time.\"\n\nA slight smile.\n\n\"It binds us to the cause. It promises contribution. But it preserves my judgment on what my kingdoms can spare. Does that satisfy your purpose, or do you need something more... binding?\"",

René just surrendered - his army is defeated and he's departing for France\n2. Queen Joanna just named Alfonso her heir publicly\n3. The Calabrian barons have knelt and sworn fealty\n4. Alfonso mentioned needing to consolidate, deal with Calabrian lords who might test him\n\nBut Alfonso also expressed concern about appearing dependent on Juan. If he asks Juan to stay and crush rebels for him, it undermines his authority as the incoming king. He needs to establish himself as capable of ruling on his own.\n\nOn the other hand, Alfonso is practical. If there's a genuine military threat he can't handle, he might ask for help.\n\nLet me think about what makes sense:\n- The French are defeated and leaving\n- No immediate military threat\n- Calabrians have sworn fealty (though some might rebel later)\n- Alfonso has his own Aragonese forces plus the Neapolitan forces that are now swearing to him\n- He needs to BUILD his authority, not borrow Juan's\n\nI think Alfonso would:\n1. Thank Juan profusely\n2. Decline further military assistance (he needs to prove himself)\n3. Maybe ask Juan to leave some symbolic presence briefly? Or just say he's got this?\n4. Mention Lucia's pregnancy as another reason for Juan to stay in Naples (not with the army, but personally)\n5. Perhaps mention the Sultan's reply that should be arriving\n\nThis doesn't need a roll - it's a practical question and Alfonso's answer flows logically from his character and situation.\n\nAlfonso shakes his head, a hint of wry humor in his expression.\n\n\"If I cannot hold Naples with the forces I have after you've shattered René's army and sent him fleeing to France, I deserve to lose it.\"\n\nHe gestures toward the window, toward the city beyond.\n\n\"I have three thousand Aragonese veterans. The Neapolitan garrison is swearing to me daily—men who defended these walls for months and watched the French break against Castilian steel. The Calabrian barons have knelt.\" He shrugs. \"Some will test me, as you said. When they do, I will crush them with my own hand. That is how a king establishes authority—not by borrowing another king's army every time a lord grows restless.\"\n\nHis expression softens.\n\n\"You have given me everything I needed, Juan. The rest I must earn myself, or it means nothing.\"\n\nAlfonso moves to clasp Juan's shoulder.\n\n\"Take your army home. Your children are growing without their father. Your kingdom has been ruled by regents for... how long now? A year? More?\" He pauses, then adds more gently: \"And unless I misremember, your wife is six months heavy with child and resting not three streets from here. She will want you present when the time comes, not campaigning in Calabria on my behalf.\"\n\nA thought crosses his face.\n\n\"Speaking of matters requiring your attention—has the Sultan's reply arrived yet?

The child Lucia is carrying would be Juan and Lucia's first child together. This creates a complex family dynamic that requires careful navigation.\n\nI recognize the delicate emotional landscape Lucia must traverse.

She follows me around the palazzo, chattering in that mix of Castilian and Italian she's invented.\" A soft smile. \"She called me mama yesterday. I did not correct her, though I wonder if I should have.\"\n\nLucia's eyes meet yours, and there is something careful in them now.\n\n\"She does not remember Isabel, does she? She was so young when...\" She leaves the sentence unfinished. \"And Fernando will never know his mother at all.

The Morocco mission - Commander Martín's mission was rolled at 71/100 (Moderate Success), results to be revealed October/November 1433... wait, that timeline doesn't match. Let me re-check.\n\nActually looking at the chapter summaries, Commander Martín departed April 5, 1433 for Morocco. The mission outcome roll was 71/100 and was supposed to be revealed October/November 1433. But we're now in July 1434 - so that report should have already come in. Perhaps it was handled in previous chapters or I need to address it.\n\nLet me focus on what's most pressing:\n\n1. The Sultan's reply - this is the big one. The previous roll was 50 (Cautious Engagement) - he agreed a meeting \"may be possible\" with conditions to be discussed through intermediaries. Now we need to see what specific conditions he proposes.\n\n2. Time skip to Lucia's delivery - late August/September 1434\n\n3. Any other events during this period\n\nLet me think about what the Sultan would realistically propose. He's a powerful ruler dealing with a Christian king who has:\n- Conquered Granada (impressive)\n- Reinforced Constantinople (a threat to Ottoman plans)\n- Clearly has military capability\n\nThe Sultan's perspective:\n- He wants to assess this new player\n- He's cautious but curious\n- He has his own concerns (Anatolia, other threats)\n- A meeting could be useful for intelligence gathering\n- He won't want to appear weak or overeager\n\nFor the Sultan's specific reply, I should probably create a roll table or just narrate what arrives based on the previous \"cautious engagement\" roll. \n\nI'll develop a nuanced diplomatic response that reflects the Sultan's strategic thinking. The communication will likely involve carefully worded proposals that test Juan's intentions while maintaining Ottoman dignity. I'll craft conditions that demonstrate political sophistication - perhaps requesting a neutral meeting location, proposing diplomatic exchanges, or seeking mutual intelligence about regional threats.\n\nThe response will need to balance curiosity about Juan's capabilities with maintaining strategic distance. I'll ensure the Sultan appears neither too eager nor dismissive, but strategically measured in his approach.\n\nLucia's expression softens completely. She leans forward—as much as her condition allows—and kisses you gently.\n\n\"Then we shall have peace,\" she murmurs. \"For a few months at least.\"\n\nTIME PASSES\n\nJuly 1434\n\nThe Castilian army disperses. Don Íñigo López de Mendoza sails with the bulk of the forces back to Castile—fifteen thousand men returning home to families, farms, and the ordinary lives of peacetime. The 200 Military Order soldiers who accompanied you from Constantinople remain as your personal guard, quartered in Naples at Alfonso's hospitality.\n\nLetters are dispatched: to Álvaro de Luna in Toledo, informing him of Naples' resolution and your intention to remain until Lucia's delivery; to Don García López de Padilla in Granada, confirming the administration continues in your absence; to the Military Order commanders, acknowledging their soldiers' service.\n\nAlfonso throws himself into the work of consolidating his new kingdom. You see him occasionally—shared dinners, brief consultations—but he is consumed with the business of transforming from heir to king.\n\nThe Sultan's Reply\n\nThree weeks after the Battle of Aversa, a Venetian trading vessel arrives in Naples harbor bearing a passenger of note: a Ottoman diplomatic secretary named Hamza Bey, accompanied by four attendants and a document bearing the tughra of Sultan Murad II.\n\nThe man requests an audience with the King of Castile.\n\nDo you receive him?

He wears a green silk robe over a white kaftan—fine but not ostentatious. His attendants remain outside; he enters alone, bearing a leather document case.\n\nHe bows—not deeply, but correctly. The bow of an emissary from a great power to the sovereign of another great power.\n\n\"As-salamu alaykum, King of Castile,\" he begins in accented but serviceable Latin, though something in his eyes suggests he noticed the Arabic greeting in your letter. \"I am Hamza Bey, secretary to the Divan of Sultan Murad Han, Shadow of God on Earth, Commander of the Faithful.

A Latin king who writes in Arabic, who speaks of understanding rather than crusade, who conquered Granada yet asks questions about the Prophet—peace be upon him—rather than demanding submission.\" Hamza Bey's expression is carefully neutral. \"The Sultan has not encountered this before.\"\n\nHe pauses, measuring his next words.\n\n\"His Majesty agrees that a meeting may be possible. But there are matters to discuss first. Questions of location, of protocol, of... purpose.\" His eyes meet yours. \"The Sultan wishes to understand what you truly seek, King of Castile. You write of understanding. You write of delivering tribute on the Emperor's behalf. But you also garrison Constantinople with Latin knights and name yourself Defensor.\"\n\nHe spreads his hands slightly.\n\n\"These are contradictory signals.

Juan's response is diplomatic - framing the military buildup as defensive investment protection, emphasizing reliable tribute payment, and then turning the question back on the Sultan.\n\nThis is a shrewd diplomatic move - it puts the Sultan on the defensive by implying that if there's going to be war, it would be the Sultan's choice to attack, not Juan's choice to provoke.\n\nHamza Bey is an experienced diplomat. He will recognize this rhetorical maneuver. How should he respond?\n\nThe Sultan's response was Roll: 50 - Cautious Engagement. He's interested but wary. Hamza Bey would be probing, testing, trying to understand Juan's true intentions.\n\nKey things Hamza Bey knows:\n1. Juan speaks Arabic - unusual and intriguing\n2. Juan conquered Granada - he's a proven military threat to Muslims\n3. Juan has garrisoned Constantinople with nearly 1,000 knights\n4. Juan is building alliances across the Mediterranean\n5. Juan expelled the Ottoman embassy after becoming Defensor\n6. The \"defensive\" framing is transparent - these preparations could support offensive operations\n\nWhat Hamza Bey wants:\n- To understand Juan's true intentions\n- To assess whether Juan is someone who can be negotiated with\n- To determine whether a meeting would be in the Sultan's interest\n- To probe for weaknesses or openings\n\nWhat Hamza Bey won't say:\n- The Sultan's actual military plans\n- Ottoman internal politics (Janissary pressure, Karaman threat)\n- Whether the Sultan sees Juan as a serious threat or a minor annoyance\n\nThe question Juan asks - \"Is the sultan making plans to attack?\" - is pointed. Hamza Bey cannot answer this honestly. He must deflect while maintaining diplomatic engagement.\n\nHamza Bey's expression remains carefully neutral, but something shifts in his eyes—a flicker of appreciation, perhaps, for the rhetorical maneuver. You have reframed the question elegantly: if there is to be war, it will be the Sultan's choice to attack, not your choice to provoke.\n\n\"The Sultan makes many plans,\" Hamza Bey replies smoothly. \"He is the Shadow of God on Earth, Commander of the Faithful. His responsibilities stretch from the Danube to Anatolia. Constantinople is... one concern among many.\"\n\nHe pauses, choosing his next words with care.\n\n\"But you must understand, King of Castile, that my master has heard such words before. 'We seek only to defend ourselves.' 'We mean no threat.' The Venetians said this when they bought Thessalonica. They fortified it. They garrisoned it. They spoke of trade and investment.\" His voice hardens slightly. \"And when the city fell, Venice sued for peace within a year and resumed trading as if nothing had happened. Seven thousand souls enslaved, and the Venetians counted their coins.\"\n\nHe steps closer, his tone more direct now.\n\n\"You are not Venice. This my master understands. You conquered Granada. You do not merely talk of holy war—you make holy war. You speak Arabic and ask questions about the Prophet, peace be upon him, yet you drove the Muslims from Iberia after eight hundred years.\"\n\nHamza Bey tilts his head, studying you.\n\n\"So when you say you seek only defense and reliable tribute... my master wonders. Is this the wolf who has eaten his fill and now wishes to sleep? Or the wolf who rests before the next hunt?\"\n\nHe reaches into his document case and produces a second scroll—smaller, unsealed.\n\n\"The Sultan proposes this: a meeting on neutral ground, as you requested. The island of Tenedos, at the mouth of the Dardanelles. Neither Ottoman nor Byzantine territory—held by Venice, who will guarantee safe passage for both parties. Equal guards—fifty men each. No more.\"\n\nHe offers the scroll.\n\n\"But before my master commits to this meeting, he wishes to know: What would you discuss? Trade arrangements, you mentioned. Tribute delivery. These are matters for secretaries, not kings.\" His eyes bore into yours. \"What does the King of Castile wish to say to the Sultan of the Ottomans that requires they meet face to face?\"",

He's being honest about his motivations - wanting to know the man he might one day face in conflict, while also genuinely interested in trade and peace for now.\n\nLet me think about how Hamza Bey would react to this:\n\n1. The honesty is refreshing but also revealing - Juan admits he wants to know his potential enemy\n2. The delay to next year is reasonable given the pregnancy, and gives the Sultan time as well\n3. The \"feeling is mutual\" comment is a bit presumptuous but not offensive\n4. The acceptance of Tenedos as neutral ground is straightforward\n\nHamza Bey is a diplomat. He would appreciate the candor while noting its implications. The Sultan wanted \"cautious engagement\" (Roll: 50) - this response from Juan fits that. The meeting is agreed in principle, deferred to next year.\n\nI should have Hamza Bey respond appropriately - acknowledging the acceptance, perhaps with a subtle observation about Juan's honesty regarding the potential for future conflict, and confirming the arrangement for next year.\n\nHamza Bey listens, and something in his posture relaxes—not entirely, but perceptibly. The tension of a diplomat bracing for lies or evasions eases into something closer to professional respect.\n\n\"You are... remarkably honest, King of Castile,\" he says slowly. \"Most rulers would speak only of eternal friendship and mutual benefit.

When I returned to Edirne and described you—the Arabic, the questions about faith, the way you moved through Constantinople as if you already owned it—the Sultan listened more carefully than I have seen him listen in years. He said...\" Hamza Bey hesitates, as if weighing whether to share this. \"He said, 'This one is dangerous. I would like to meet him.'\"\n\nHe tucks the scroll back into his case.\n\n\"Next year, then. Spring, perhaps, when the seas are calm and your child is safely delivered. I will carry your acceptance to my master.\" He bows—slightly deeper than before, a gesture of genuine respect rather than mere protocol. \"The details—exact dates, the number of ships, the arrangements with Venice—these can be negotiated through intermediaries over the winter.\"\n\nHamza Bey moves toward the door, then pauses.\n\n\"One more thing, King of Castile. My master asked me to observe you. To assess what manner of man you are.\" His dark eyes meet yours. \"I will tell him this: You conquered Granada not through cruelty but through strategy. You took Constantinople's loyalty not through force but through generosity. You speak of defense, but you build alliances that could threaten our borders from Hungary to the Mediterranean.\"\n\nA thin smile crosses his weathered face.\n\n\"I will tell him you are exactly as dangerous as he suspected. And that you would make either a worthy enemy or a valuable... arrangement.\" He uses the word carefully, avoiding friend or ally—concepts that do not exist between the Cross and the Crescent.\n\n\"Ma'a salama, King of Castile. Until Tenedos.\"\n\nHe bows once more and withdraws.\n\nThe summer heat presses against the windows. Somewhere in the palazzo, Lucia rests with your unborn child. Alfonso consolidates his new kingdom.

Captain Fernán - military man, practical, would think about security concerns and what soldiers/fighters need\n2. Brother Martín - Franciscan, educated, would think about Church channels, monasteries, religious motivation\n3. Don Bernat de Centelles - Aragonese diplomat, knows Italian politics, would know about merchant networks, Italian city-states\n4.

Let me have each person contribute something useful based on their expertise.\n\nKey considerations:\n- Who would be interested in settling in Constantinople?\n- What are the barriers to settlement?\n- How do you spread the word effectively in the 15th century?\n- What are the risks people would perceive?\n\nPotential audiences:\n1. Younger sons of noble houses (no inheritance)\n2. Merchants seeking new trade opportunities\n3. Adventurers and soldiers of fortune\n4. Religious orders\n5. Craftsmen and artisans\n6. Displaced or dispossessed people\n\nChannels for recruitment:\n1. Church networks (papal endorsement, crusade preaching)\n2. Merchant networks (Venice, Genoa, Florence banking houses)\n3. Noble courts (personal letters, ambassadors)\n4. Universities (scholars interested in Greek learning)\n5. Military orders\n6. Word of mouth from those already there\n\nBarriers to address:\n1. Fear of Ottoman attack\n2. Distance from home\n3. Uncertainty about Greek-Latin relations\n4. Cost of the journey\n5. Leaving established positions\n\nLet me have each council member raise points from their perspective.\n\nThe council stirs with interest. Don Bernat leans forward, his diplomat's mind already working. Lucia's eyes sharpen—this is the kind of problem she understands.\n\nDon Bernat de Centelles speaks first, his Aragonese-accented Castilian measured and thoughtful:\n\n\"Your Majesty speaks of attracting settlers. But we must ask: who do we wish to attract, and what do they fear?\"\n\nHe ticks off points on his fingers.\n\n\"The opportunity is extraordinary—I grant this. Ducal titles for two hundred men? In Italy, such titles cost fortunes and take generations to acquire. But...\" He pauses. \"Constantinople is far. The Turk surrounds it. Men have heard of Thessalonica—seven thousand enslaved, the city sacked. They will ask: why should I risk my family, my fortune, my life, when the Sultan might simply take it all?\"\n\nHe spreads his hands. \"The terms matter less than the confidence. Men must believe Constantinople will stand.\"\n\nCaptain Fernán grunts in agreement.\n\n\"Don Bernat speaks true. Soldiers I can find—there are always men willing to fight for pay and glory. But settlers? Men who bring wives, children, gold to invest?\" He shakes his head. \"They need to believe they will live to enjoy what they build. The walls must hold. The garrison must be strong. Word must spread that Constantinople is defended, not merely occupied.\"\n\nBrother Martín clears his throat, his voice softer but carrying weight:\n\n\"Your Majesty, the Church is a powerful instrument for such matters. The crusade has been proclaimed. If His Holiness could be persuaded to grant... perhaps not plenary indulgence, but significant spiritual rewards for those who settle in defense of Christendom—not merely fight, but stay—the preaching networks of the mendicant orders could spread word to every parish in Europe.\"\n\nHe hesitates. \"There are also the younger sons. Every noble house has them—men of good blood with no inheritance, no prospects. A title in Constantinople is better than nothing in Castile or Aragon or Italy.\"\n\nLucia has been listening, her grey-green eyes moving from speaker to speaker. Now she speaks, her voice cutting through:\n\n\"You are all thinking like men.\"\n\nShe shifts in her chair, one hand resting on her belly.\n\n\"Nobles and merchants do not make decisions alone. They have wives. Mothers. Sisters who whisper in their ears.\" A thin smile. \"If you want settlers, you must make Constantinople a place women will agree to go. Not just walls and soldiers—churches, markets, physicians, society. A noble wife must believe she can raise her children there, attend mass in a proper cathedral, find suitable marriages for her daughters.\"\n\nShe looks at Juan directly.\n\n\"Write to the wives. Or better—find women who have already gone and returned safely. Let them speak of what Constantinople offers. A man may dream of titles, but he will not move his family into a war camp.\"\n\nThe council falls silent, considering. Then Don Bernat speaks again:\n\n\"There is also the question of where to recruit. Italy is obvious—Venice, Genoa, Florence all have men seeking opportunity, and they know the Eastern trade. But they also have old grievances with the Greeks.\" He glances at Lucia. \"Ferrara, Mantua, the smaller states—fewer grievances, more hunger. And Aragon, of course. King Alfonso could be persuaded to encourage settlement if it serves his interests in the Eastern Mediterranean.\"\n\nHe pauses. \"What channels does Your Majesty wish to pursue? Church networks? Merchant guilds? Direct appeals to noble houses? All require different approaches—and different resources.\"",

But first, you must dig the channel.\"\n\nDon Bernat strokes his chin thoughtfully.\n\n\"The opportunity is remarkable. But Your Majesty is correct—if men do not know of it, they cannot act upon it. The question becomes: how do we ensure the news spreads widely and accurately?\"\n\nHe begins pacing, thinking aloud.\n\n\"Rumors spread on their own, but they distort. By the time word of Constantinople reaches a second son in Salamanca, it may have transformed into fantasy or nightmare. We need... a proclamation. Something official. Something that can be copied, read aloud in market squares, posted on church doors.\"\n\nBrother Martín brightens.\n\n\"The Church already has such networks, Your Majesty. When His Holiness proclaimed the crusade, copies went to every bishop, every cathedral chapter, every monastery. The same mechanism could carry word of these settlement terms. A papal letter encouraging faithful Christians to settle in defense of Constantinople—this would reach places royal proclamations never could.\"\n\nHe pauses. \"The mendicant orders especially. Franciscans and Dominicans preach in every town and village. If they speak of this opportunity from the pulpit...\"\n\nCaptain Fernán interjects gruffly:\n\n\"Proclamations are well and good, but men believe what they see. When the first settlers return with stories of success—when a landless knight writes home that he now holds a title and a house—that is when others will follow.\" He shrugs. \"The first wave is always the hardest. After that, success breeds success.\"\n\nLucia taps her finger against the arm of her chair.\n\n\"Then we need both. The proclamation to plant the seed. And the stories to make it grow.\" She looks at Juan. \"Is there anyone already in Constantinople who could write such letters? Someone whose word would be trusted back home? A knight from a known family, a merchant from a respected guild?\"\n\nShe tilts her head. \"And what of those who have already committed? The knights of the Military Orders, the nobles who pledged men—do their families know what they stand to gain? A mother who learns her son may become a duke will speak of nothing else at every gathering she attends.\"\n\nDon Bernat raises a finger.\n\n\"There is also the matter of the Italian merchant republics. Venice and Genoa already have quarters in Constantinople—they know the city, they know the trade. If their merchants begin speaking of new opportunities, new legal protections, favorable terms... word spreads through commercial networks faster than any proclamation.\"\n\nHe hesitates. \"But Venice and Genoa are rivals. Favor one too openly and the other grows hostile. Perhaps... perhaps we approach the smaller Italian states first. Ferrara, Mantua, Florence. Let them establish themselves before the great powers realize what they are missing.\"\n\nThe council looks to you. The outlines of a strategy are forming:\n\nOfficial proclamation — documenting the terms, to be copied and distributed\n\nChurch networks — papal endorsement, mendicant preaching\n\nPersonal letters — from those already committed, to families back home\n\nMerchant channels — through Italian trading networks\n\nEarly success stories — letting the first settlers become recruiters\n\nWhat approach does Juan wish to prioritize?",

      "text": "Juan is asking about the capacity of the Military Orders to support 2,000 soldiers in Constantinople. Let me think about what we know from the project files:\n\nFrom the campaign:\n- The three Military Orders (Santiago, Calatrava, Alcántara) pledged significant forces for the Granada crusade\n- Santiago: 2,000 knights\n- Calatrava: 1,500 knights\n- Alcántara: 1,000 knights\n\nCurrently in Constantinople:\n- 715 Military Order soldiers under Don Juan de Sotomayor (Master of Alcántara)\n- Plus 150 Hospitaller reinforcement committed from Rhodes\n\nThe question is whether they can support 2,000 soldiers in Constantinople. This is a logistical and organizational question.\n\nCaptain Fernán would know about military logistics but might not be the expert on the Military Orders' internal capacity. He's a royal guard commander, not a Military Order official.\n\nLet me think about what Fernán would realistically say:\n1. He's a practical military man\n2. He would think about logistics - supply, rotation, cost\n3. He might defer to the Masters of the Orders for the actual capacity question\n4. The Orders have returned to normal operations after the crusade service was completed\n\nThe crusade reference - during the height of the crusades, the Orders could field larger forces, but that was centuries ago and in different circumstances.\n\nFernán should give a practical military assessment but acknowledge he's not the authority on Order internal matters.\n\nCaptain Fernán furrows his brow, considering the question carefully. He's a royal guard commander, not a Military Order official, but he's fought alongside them for years.\n\n\"Your Majesty, I can speak to what I've seen, though the Masters themselves would know their true capacity better than I.\"\n\nHe counts on his fingers.\n\n\"During the Granada campaign, the three Orders fielded their full strength—Santiago brought two thousand, Calatrava fifteen hundred, Alcántara one thousand. That was everything they had, and it strained them. Men, horses, supplies—all committed for two years of hard campaigning.\"\n\nHe pauses, thinking.\n\n\"Now they've returned to their territories. The crusade service is complete. They're recovering, rebuilding, tending to their estates and commanderies.\" He shakes his head slowly. \"Asking them to maintain two thousand men permanently in Constantinople... that's different from a campaign. A campaign ends. A garrison is forever.\"\n\nDon Bernat interjects:\n\n\"There's also the question of distance. Granada was Castilian territory—supply lines were short, reinforcements close. Constantinople is months away by sea. Every man stationed there must be fed, armed, paid, and rotated eventually. The cost of maintaining a thousand men in Constantinople is perhaps three times what it would cost in Iberia.\"\n\nCaptain Fernán nods and continues:\n\n\"Seven hundred are there now under Sotomayor. The Orders could likely sustain twelve to fifteen hundred without breaking themselves—rotating companies, perhaps three hundred men cycling home each year while fresh troops arrive.\" He meets Juan's eyes. \"Two thousand permanently? That would require the Pope's authority to compel it, or significant crown support to offset the cost. The Masters would resist depleting their home garrisons entirely.\"\n\nHe hesitates.\n\n\"Unless... Your Majesty intends to change how the Orders operate? The papal decree gave you authority over them. If Constantinople becomes their primary purpose rather than an obligation alongside their Iberian duties...\"\n\nThe implication hangs in the air. The Military Orders could be transformed from Iberian institutions into Mediterranean crusading forces—but that would be a fundamental change to their identity and purpose.",

      "text": "Juan is making a significant strategic decision - expanding the Military Order presence in Constantinople to 1000 soldiers, establishing commanderies there, and planning to give them a new mission charter binding them to the Apokatastasis (the Byzantine restoration). This is a major shift in their purpose from Iberian defenders to Mediterranean crusading forces.\n\nCurrently there are 715 Military Order soldiers in Constantinople under Don Juan de Sotomayor. Juan wants to bring this to 1000, which means sending 285 more.\n\nI should have the council react to this - they would see this as significant. The Military Orders being given a new purpose beyond Iberia is a major development. Let me think about how each character would respond:\n\n- Captain Fernán: Military logistics perspective, would see this as achievable\n- Brother Martín: Would see the spiritual significance, the continuation of crusade\n- Don Bernat: Political implications, how this affects Aragón's interests\n- Lucia: Strategic/political mind, might see both opportunity and concerns\n\nThis is a decision, not a request for advice, so they should acknowledge and respond appropriately. I should also note that letters will need to be drafted to the Masters of the three Orders.\n\nThe council absorbs this declaration. There is a weight to it—the sense of a king reshaping institutions that have existed for centuries.\n\nBrother Martín crosses himself, his eyes bright.\n\n\"A new holy cause,\" he repeats softly. \"The Reconquista complete, and now the Orders turn eastward. Santiago, Calatrava, Alcántara—no longer defenders of a frontier that no longer exists, but swords of Christendom against the greater enemy.\" He looks at Juan with something approaching awe. \"Your Majesty, this is... this is what the Orders were founded for. Before they became landlords and tax collectors. You would restore them to their purpose.\"\n\nCaptain Fernán nods slowly, the practical soldier calculating.\n\n\"Two hundred eighty-five more men to bring the garrison to one thousand. That's achievable—a company from each Order, rotated from their Iberian holdings. The commanderies in Constantinople...\" He pauses, thinking. \"That's clever. Once they have property there, permanent presence, they're invested. It's no longer a distant obligation but their own land to defend.\"\n\nDon Bernat strokes his chin, his diplomat's mind working through implications.\n\n\"King Alfonso will be interested in this development. Aragón has its own Military Orders—the Order of Montesa, small but capable. If Castilian Orders establish themselves in Constantinople, Aragonese knights may wish to follow.\" He glances at Juan. \"This serves the alliance. Iberian military presence in the Eastern Mediterranean, bound by holy oaths rather than merely treaties.\"\n\nHe hesitates. \"The Masters, though—they are proud men. They will accept Your Majesty's authority, as the papal decree commands. But how you present this matters. If it seems punishment or exile, they will resist in subtle ways. If it seems honor and holy mission...\"\n\nLucia has been watching Juan with an expression he has come to recognize—the sharp assessment of a political mind.\n\n\"You are not merely garrisoning a city,\" she says quietly. \"You are building an institution. The Orders bound to Constantinople become your Orders in a way they never were in Iberia, where they answer to Pope and tradition as much as crown.\" Her grey-green eyes meet his. \"When you write this charter, my love, you are writing the future of Christian power in the East. Choose your words carefully.\"\n\nShe pauses.\n\n\"And the Masters should be present when you announce this new mission. Let them stand beside you, not receive letters from afar. They must feel they are partners in this holy cause, not servants receiving commands.\"\n\nBrother Martín looks up from his notes.\n\n\"Shall I draft the letter to the Masters requesting the additional troops, Your Majesty? And perhaps... an outline of the new mission charter, to be refined when you return to Castile?\"",

Military Orders providing genuine security (now 1,000 men)\n5. Hospitaller commitment from Rhodes\n6. The Defensor title and alliance structure gives credibility\n7. Addressing both men AND women - smart recruitment\n8. Honest framing (acknowledging risk) builds trust\n9. Existing Latin quarters in Constantinople can report organic success stories\n10.

News spreads faster than any proclamation. The settlement campaign becomes a warning rather than invitation. Fewer than 50 settlers arrive; some existing residents leave. The Military Orders question their commitment. Recovery will take years of demonstrated stability.\n6-15\nSignificant Failure\nThe Pope delays endorsement, citing concerns about provoking the Sultan or requiring Greek religious concessions first. Without papal backing, the proclamation reaches only scattered parishes. Venetian and Genoese merchants actively discourage settlement to protect their monopolies. Perhaps 100-200 settlers arrive—mostly desperate men with nothing to lose. Women refuse to go. The Military Orders send only 200 additional men, citing logistical difficulties.\n16-25\nPoor Results\nThe proclamation distributes but fails to inspire. Thessalonica's memory proves stronger than promises. A few hundred settlers arrive—mostly younger sons and adventurers, very few families. Italian merchants show no interest. The Military Orders reach 850 men but resist establishing permanent commanderies, preferring rotation. Constantinople gains little; the campaign is not a disaster but clearly disappoints.\n26-40\nModest Impact\nThe campaign produces measurable but limited results. Approximately 400-600 settlers arrive over two years—a mix of knights seeking titles, craftsmen seeking opportunity, and a small number of families. The Military Orders reach 1,000 men and establish minimal commanderies. Italian merchants from smaller states (Ferrara, Mantua) show tentative interest. The Greek population remains wary but not hostile. A foundation exists, but momentum is slow.\n41-55\nModerate Success\nThe proclamation resonates with its target audience. Roughly 800-1,200 settlers arrive—including meaningful numbers of families, particularly from Iberia and the smaller Italian states. The Military Orders establish proper commanderies and begin treating Constantinople as a permanent mission. Trade begins improving as new merchants arrive. Some early success stories circulate back to Europe. The settlement is viable but not yet thriving.\n56-70\nStrong Results\nThe honest framing and Church networks prove effective. Approximately 1,500-2,000 settlers arrive, including a healthy proportion of families. Several minor noble houses commit younger sons with retinues. Craftsmen establish workshops; merchants open trading houses. The Military Orders embrace their Eastern mission. Quarterly reports show genuine economic improvement. Word spreads organically—success breeds interest. Constantinople begins feeling alive again.\n71-85\nExcellent Response\nThe campaign exceeds expectations. Between 2,500-3,500 settlers arrive—families, knights, merchants, craftsmen. The combination of spiritual calling and concrete opportunity proves powerful. Several Italian banking houses establish branches. The Military Orders compete for honor in Constantinople rather than resisting deployment. Greek residents begin cautiously engaging with Latin newcomers. The city's population grows noticeably; abandoned districts see rehabilitation. Europe takes notice.\n86-95\nRemarkable Success\nThe proclamation sparks genuine enthusiasm. Over 4,000 settlers arrive in two years—a transformation visible to anyone who visits. Noble families of middling rank relocate entirely, seeking the titles promised. Merchant guilds establish formal presence. The Military Orders build substantial commanderies and request more men be allowed to serve. Greek-Latin cooperation emerges in trade and defense. Constantinople becomes a destination rather than a risk. Other Christian powers begin asking how they might participate.\n96-100\nExtraordinary Transformation\nSomething catches fire. The proclamation combines with Juan's reputation, the crusade fervor, and genuine opportunity to create a movement. Over 5,000 settlers arrive—enough to meaningfully restore Constantinople's population. Entire extended families relocate. Italian city-states compete for trading privileges. The Military Orders petition to make Constantinople their primary headquarters. Greeks and Latins begin intermarrying. The city buzzes with construction, commerce, and hope. Christendom speaks of the Apokatastasis as something real, not merely a dream. The Sultan takes notice.\n\nGM Notes:\n\nThis is a genuine chaos roll with wide variance. The approach is solid—Church networks, honest framing, addressing women, military credibility—but not exceptional. No direct recruitment ambassadors, limited targeting of specific merchant networks, and reliance on proclamation rather than personal outreach.\n\nThe external factors (Ottoman threat, Thessalonica memory, distance, Venetian/Genoese opposition) create real downside risk. But the unprecedented nature of the opportunity (ducal titles for 200 men!) and Juan's credibility as the Reconquista conqueror create genuine upside potential.\n\nReady to roll when you are.",

She remains seated, one hand on her belly, watching you with that sharp gaze.\n\n\"You plant seeds so easily,\" she says quietly. \"I wonder if you know what forests you are growing.\"\n\nWHAT THIS ROLL MEANS (to unfold over coming chapters)\n\nThe Proclamation:\n\nPope Eugenius IV endorses the settlement proclamation with unexpected enthusiasm—he sees it as vindication of his support for Juan's crusade and a counter to conciliarist critics who accused him of empty gestures. The mendicant orders carry it to every corner of Christendom with genuine fervor. Franciscans preach it as holy calling; Dominicans frame it as intellectual renewal in the ancient seat of learning.\n\nThe honest framing—acknowledging risk while appealing to faith—proves extraordinarily effective. It separates the fearful from the bold, and the bold respond.\n\nThe Numbers:\n\nOver the next two years, more than 5,000 settlers arrive in Constantinople. This is enough to meaningfully reverse decades of population decline—not restoration to ancient glory, but visible, tangible growth. Abandoned districts see hammers and saws. Empty markets fill with voices.\n\nThe Character of Settlement:\n\nEntire extended families relocate, particularly from Iberia where the Granada precedent proved settlement works\n\nMinor noble houses commit younger sons with full retinues, seeking the titles promised\n\nItalian city-states—initially Ferrara, Mantua, Florence—compete for trading privileges, breaking the Venetian-Genoese duopoly\n\nCraftsmen and artisans establish workshops, drawn by the promise of protected guilds and hungry markets\n\nWomen come in meaningful numbers, reassured by the proclamation's direct address to their concerns\n\nThe Military Orders:\n\nThe Masters, initially cautious, find their younger knights requesting Constantinople postings. The combination of holy mission and genuine opportunity proves irresistible to men who took vows expecting crusade and found themselves managing estates. By 1436, the Orders petition to make Constantinople their primary headquarters—a complete reversal of the expected resistance.\n\nGreek-Latin Relations:\n\nSomething unexpected emerges. The settlers who come are self-selected for faith and courage, not conquest and plunder. The legal protections Juan established—the Tribunal Latinorum, the Constitution of Contributions and Claims—prove their worth. Greeks and Latins begin cautiously cooperating, then trading, then—in scattered cases—intermarrying.\n\nThe Fourth Crusade's shadow does not vanish. But it begins, slowly, to lift.\n\nChristendom's Perception:\n\nThe Apokatastasis transforms from a foreign word in a distant decree to something people talk about. In taverns from Lisbon to Vienna, men discuss Constantinople's revival. The city becomes a symbol—proof that Christendom can build, not merely defend.\n\nThe Sultan's Notice:\n\nMurad II receives reports. The city he expected to wither is instead growing. The walls he expected to crumble are manned by Military Order knights. The population he expected to flee is being reinforced.\n\nThe cautious Sultan grows more cautious still. But his janissaries grow restless. Idle armies are dangerous, and Constantinople—swelling with Latin settlers and Latin gold—becomes a more tempting prize even as it becomes a harder target.\n\nThe meeting at Tenedos, scheduled for spring 1435, takes on new weight.\n\nCurrent Date: Late July 1434\n\nLucia's Delivery: Expected late August/September 1434\n\nCouncil Decisions Implemented:\n\nLetters to Military Order Masters: Increase Constantinople garrison to 1,000, establish permanent commanderies\n\nSettlement proclamation: Drafted for papal endorsement and Church distribution\n\nNew mission charter: To be formalized upon return to Castile\n\nWhat does Juan do for the remainder of the summer while awaiting Lucia's delivery?",

All other matters fade to insignificance.\n6-10\nDire News from the East\nA messenger arrives from Constantinople bearing alarming news—Ottoman raid on the suburbs, major fire in the Latin quarter, violent Greek-Latin riot, or plague outbreak. The settlement campaign may be compromised before it begins. Juan must decide whether to sail east immediately or trust Sotomayor to handle the crisis.\n11-15\nCrisis in Castile\nWord arrives from Álvaro de Luna. Something has gone wrong at home—noble rebellion brewing, treasury crisis, illness among the royal children, or Portuguese border incident. Juan is pulled between his duty to Lucia and his duty to his kingdom. Difficult choices must be made.\n16-20\nAlfonso's Troubles\nThe Calabrian barons who knelt so recently prove false. Rebellion flares in the southern provinces. Alfonso requests Juan's aid—or at least his counsel. Naples is not as secure as it appeared, and Juan's army has already been disbanded.\n21-25\nUnwelcome Visitor\nSomeone arrives in Naples who complicates matters—a papal legate with demands, a French envoy protesting René's treatment, a Genoese delegation with grievances, or an Ottoman observer \"ensuring\" the tribute arrangements. Diplomacy intrudes on Juan's quiet summer.\n26-35\nMinor Concerns\nSmall troubles accumulate. A fever passes through the household (not serious, but worrying). A letter goes astray. A servant proves dishonest. Lucia grows irritable in the summer heat. Nothing catastrophic, but the weeks are not entirely peaceful. Juan handles petty problems while waiting for the birth.\n36-50\nQuiet Waiting\nThe summer passes without significant incident. Juan spends time with Lucia, corresponds with his officials, perhaps explores Naples or builds his relationship with Alfonso. The world grants him a rare gift: peace. Lucia's pregnancy progresses normally. The only drama is the natural anxiety of awaiting a child.\n51-60\nGood News Arrives\nPositive reports reach Naples. Perhaps the Military Orders respond enthusiastically to their new mission. Perhaps Álvaro writes of continued stability in Castile. Perhaps early word suggests the settlement proclamation is being well-received. The waiting weeks bring encouragement rather than crisis.\n61-70\nStrengthening Bonds\nThe quiet weeks prove valuable for relationships. Deep conversations with Lucia strengthen their marriage. Time with Alfonso cements the alliance into genuine friendship. Juan learns more about Naples, its people, its potential role in his grand strategy. The waiting is not wasted—it builds foundations.\n71-80\nUnexpected Opportunity\nSomething fortunate emerges from the summer's quiet. A useful contact arrives in Naples—a scholar, a merchant with Eastern connections, a military expert, a diplomat with valuable intelligence. Or perhaps Juan discovers something about Naples itself that serves his larger purposes. Opportunity knocks unbidden.\n81-90\nFavorable Developments\nMultiple pieces of good news arrive. The Military Orders exceed expectations. Early settlement interest proves strong. Alfonso's consolidation proceeds smoothly. A letter from Constantinople reports the city thriving under Sotomayor's command. The summer proves that Juan's plans are working even in his absence.\n91-95\nPersonal Joy\nThe birth goes exceptionally well. Lucia delivers quickly and safely, recovering with remarkable speed. The child is healthy and strong. Juan experiences genuine happiness uncomplicated by crisis or duty. For a brief, precious moment, he is simply a husband and father, not a king building empires.\n96-100\nBlessed Summer\nEverything aligns. The birth is easy; mother and child thrive. Wonderful news arrives from multiple quarters—Castile stable, Constantinople flourishing, the settlement campaign already generating enthusiasm, the Military Orders embracing their new mission. Alfonso's Naples secure. Even the weather cooperates. Juan enters autumn with his family healthy, his alliances strong, and his plans succeeding beyond expectation. Providence seems to smile.\n\nGM Notes:\n\nThis is a pure chaos roll. Juan has made no specific decisions to influence it—he is simply waiting. The table reflects the reality that medieval life was unpredictable: pregnancies were dangerous, news traveled slowly, crises could erupt anywhere.\n\nThe weighting is roughly neutral—neither optimistic nor pessimistic. Bad outcomes (1-25) balance against good outcomes (71-100), with the middle range (26-70) representing normal variation from quiet to mildly positive.\n\nThe pregnancy itself is the most significant variable. Medieval childbirth was genuinely dangerous, even for queens with the best available care.\n\nReady to roll when you are.",

      "text": "The summer passes in languid stillness.\n\nNaples bakes under the August sun. Juan finds himself in an unfamiliar situation—a king with nothing urgent to do. Letters have been sent; responses will take weeks to arrive. The army has disbanded and sailed home. Alfonso is consumed with the business of claiming his inheritance, meeting with Calabrian lords, reorganizing the administration Queen Joanna neglected in her final years.\n\nJuan corresponds with his officials. A letter to Álvaro confirming the Naples resolution and the Ottoman envoy's visit. A letter to Don García López de Padilla in Granada, inquiring about the administration. A letter to Fray Hernando in Basel, asking about the Council's mood.\n\nThe replies, when they come, are reassuring in their mundanity. Castile is stable. Granada is quiet. The Council debates endlessly but has not erupted into schism. The world turns without requiring Juan's immediate attention.\n\nHe explores Naples—the great Castel Nuovo, the crowded harbor, the ancient churches. He dines with Alfonso when the King of Aragón can spare an evening from his duties. They speak of strategy, of family, of the future they are building together.\n\nMostly, he waits.\n\nLucia grows larger and more uncomfortable as the weeks pass. She complains about the heat, about the food, about the inadequacy of Neapolitan physicians compared to those she might have had in Ferrara or Toledo. Juan has learned that these complaints are how she manages fear—by focusing on irritations she can name rather than dangers she cannot control.\n\nThe silence from the wider world is, in its way, a blessing. No news is good news. The crises that might have been—Ottoman aggression, Castilian rebellion, Neapolitan treachery—do not materialize.\n\nSeptember arrives. The heat begins to break.\n\nAnd Lucia's time draws near.\n\nPREGNANCY ROLL\n\nSituation: Lucia d'Este, age 24, delivers her first child in Naples.

She has access to Salerno-trained physicians, experienced midwives, and the resources of a royal household in Naples. She has had two months to rest after the sea voyage from Constantinople. The summer heat has broken.\n\nFactors:\n\nAge 24: Optimal childbearing years\n\nFirst delivery: Typically more difficult than subsequent births\n\nExcellent medical care: Best available in Christendom\n\nGood rest: Two months settled in Naples\n\nPrior travel stress: Long sea voyage during pregnancy, now recovered\n\nGeneral health: No recorded illness or complications during pregnancy\n\nD100 TABLE: Lucia's Delivery\n\nRoll\nResult\nDescription\n1-3\nCatastrophic\nThe delivery goes terribly wrong. Despite the physicians' best efforts, Lucia suffers complications beyond their skill to address—catastrophic bleeding, fever that sets in immediately, or physical trauma. Juan faces the very real possibility of losing his wife. If she survives, recovery will be measured in months, and future pregnancies may be impossible.\n4-8\nSevere Complications\nThe labor is prolonged and brutal—more than a day of agony. Lucia survives, but barely. Severe bleeding or internal damage leaves her bedridden for weeks. The physicians speak carefully about \"rest\" and \"time,\" but their eyes tell a darker story. Recovery will take months; her health may never fully return. Future pregnancies carry grave risk.\n9-15\nDifficult Delivery\nA hard labor lasting many hours. The physicians must intervene in ways that leave Lucia exhausted and weakened. She loses significant blood and develops a mild fever in the days following. Full recovery takes six to eight weeks. The experience is traumatic; she will not speak of it willingly. Future pregnancies are possible but should be approached with caution.\n16-25\nComplicated but Successful\nThe delivery presents challenges—the labor is long, the pain severe, and there are moments when the physicians exchange worried glances. But their skill proves sufficient. Lucia emerges exhausted and shaken, requiring four to six weeks of recovery. She will carry the memory of this difficulty, but her health is not permanently compromised.\n26-40\nHard but Normal\nA difficult first delivery, as many are. The labor lasts through the night and into the morning. Lucia endures considerable pain and emerges drained. But the physicians assure Juan this is within normal bounds for a first birth. Recovery takes three to four weeks. She will be tired and sore, but there are no lasting concerns.\n41-60\nNormal Delivery\nThe birth proceeds as births do—painful, frightening, exhausting, but ultimately successful. The labor lasts eight to twelve hours. Lucia curses in Italian, grips the midwife's hand until her knuckles whiten, and endures. Recovery takes two to three weeks. The physicians are satisfied; there are no complications worth noting. A routine delivery, insofar as any delivery is routine.\n61-75\nSmooth Delivery\nThe labor progresses well. The physicians note approvingly that Lucia's body seems well-suited to childbirth. The worst is over within six to eight hours. She is tired but not destroyed by the experience. Recovery takes perhaps two weeks. Lucia jokes weakly afterward that Italian women are made of stronger stuff than Castilian physicians expected.\n76-85\nEasy Delivery\nRemarkably straightforward for a first birth. The labor is measured in hours, not days. Lucia's pain is significant but manageable; she remains lucid throughout. The physicians have little to do but catch. Recovery is swift—within ten days she is walking, within two weeks she feels nearly herself. The midwives call it a blessing.\n86-95\nSwift and Sure\nThe delivery is almost suspiciously easy. Labor begins and within four to five hours, it is done. Lucia is astonished at how quickly it passed. The physicians exchange pleased glances—this is the kind of birth they wish all noble ladies experienced. Recovery takes barely a week. Lucia regains her sharp tongue almost immediately, which Juan takes as the surest sign of her health.\n96-100\nBlessed Birth\nEverything aligns perfectly. The labor is short, the pain manageable, the delivery uncomplicated. Lucia emerges tired but radiant, recovering her strength within days. The physicians speak of it as one of the easiest noble births they have attended. The midwives whisper that God's favor rests on this house. Within a week, Lucia is holding court from her chambers, complaining about the food and demanding better wine—utterly herself.\n\nReady to roll when you are.",

He rises to find the Palazzo Caracciolo already stirring, candles lit in windows, midwives hurrying through corridors. The Salerno physicians have been summoned; they arrive within the hour, grave-faced men carrying leather bags of instruments Juan does not wish to examine.\n\nHe is not permitted in the birthing chamber. This is women's work, the midwives tell him firmly. He may wait in the antechamber. He may pray. He may pace. But he may not interfere.\n\nSo Juan waits.\n\nThe hours pass with agonizing slowness. He hears Lucia's cries through the heavy door—at first controlled, then ragged, then sounds he has never heard a human make. He paces. He prays. He sends servants for updates and receives only \"proceeding normally\" and \"these things take time.\"\n\nDawn comes. The cries continue.\n\nCaptain Fernán appears at some point, says something about standing watch, positions himself by the door. Juan barely registers his presence. Brother Martín arrives to pray with him; the Latin words wash over Juan without meaning.\n\nMid-morning. The cries grow worse, then suddenly stop.\n\nJuan's heart freezes.\n\nThen—a different sound. Thin, warbling, unmistakable.\n\nA baby's cry.\n\nThe chief physician emerges an hour later, wiping his hands on a cloth. His expression is tired but satisfied.\n\n\"Your Majesty. The Queen has delivered successfully. A difficult labor, but within normal bounds for a first birth. She is exhausted and will require rest—two to three weeks before she should be moved, longer before she regains her full strength.\"\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\"She is asking for you.\"\n\nJuan finds Lucia propped against pillows, her dark hair plastered to her forehead with sweat, her grey-green eyes shadowed with exhaustion. She looks like she has fought a battle—because she has.\n\nBut she is alive. She is whole. And in her arms...\n\nShe looks up as he enters. A weak smile crosses her face.\n\n\"Well,\" she says, her voice hoarse. \"That was unpleasant. I hope you appreciate what I endure for this dynasty of yours.\"\n\nThe child's gender and health remain to be determined.\n\nShall I draft a table for the child, or do you wish to roll separately for gender and health?",

The little girl is playing with wooden blocks, stacking them into precarious towers and knocking them down with delighted shrieks.\n\nShe looks up as you enter, and her face transforms.\n\n\"Papa!\"\n\nShe abandons the blocks and runs to you on unsteady legs, arms raised.

Constantinople, Rhodes, Naples—she has seen more of the world than most adults, though she will remember little of it.\n\nYou lift her, and she wraps her small arms around your neck.\n\n\"Papa, I builded a castle,\" she informs you seriously. \"It falled down.\"\n\n\"I saw,\" you tell her. \"It was a very good castle.\"\n\n\"Where is Mama?\" she asks—meaning Lucia, the only mother she truly remembers now.\n\n\"Mama is resting.

Bianca's fingers curl reflexively around Catalina's fingertip.\n\nCatalina's eyes go wide.\n\n\"She grabbed me!\"\n\n\"She likes you,\" Lucia says. \"She knows you're her big sister.\"\n\nCatalina considers this for a long moment, her expression shifting through several emotions too complex for her years.

Overland to Toledo\n\nGiven they're traveling with a newborn (who would be 2-3 months old by departure), Lucia recovering, and Catalina (nearly 3 years old), the journey needs to be taken carefully.\n\nI should draft a chaos roll table for the journey that accounts for:\n- Weather/sea conditions (winter travel is more dangerous)\n- Health of the travelers (newborn, recovering mother, toddler)\n- Potential incidents along the way\n- Political situations they might encounter\n\nLet me create a balanced table.\n\nCHAOS ROLL: Journey from Naples to Toledo (Late 1434 - Early 1435)\n\nSituation: Juan, Lucia (recovering from childbirth), baby Bianca (2-3 months old at departure), Catalina (nearly 3 years old), and household travel from Naples to Toledo. The journey involves sea voyage to a Spanish port, then overland travel to Toledo. Winter travel carries additional risks, but the pace is deliberately slow and cautious.\n\nFactors:\n\nNewborn infant: Vulnerable to cold, illness, the rigors of travel\n\nRecovering mother: Lucia has had two months to recover; should be capable of travel but not fully robust\n\nToddler: Catalina is energetic but manageable\n\nSeason: Late autumn/winter—rougher seas, colder overland travel\n\nResources: Royal household with full support, best available accommodations\n\nPace: Deliberately slow, prioritizing safety over speed\n\nRoute: Likely Naples → sea to Valencia or Barcelona → overland to Toledo\n\nD100 TABLE: The Journey Home\n\nRoll\nResult\nDescription\n1-5\nDisaster at Sea\nA winter storm catches the fleet. Ships are separated, damaged, or worse. The royal family endures terrifying hours or days of crisis. Even if all survive, the experience is traumatic—loss of baggage, servants, or escort possible. The journey must be halted for extensive recovery. Lucia's health may suffer a setback; the infant's survival becomes a matter of desperate prayer.\n6-10\nSerious Illness\nSickness strikes the traveling party—fever, flux, or winter ailment. Bianca, Lucia, or Catalina falls dangerously ill, forcing an extended halt at whatever port or town they've reached. Weeks of anxious waiting while physicians do what they can. Recovery is eventual but the journey is delayed by a month or more, and the experience leaves scars.\n11-15\nRough Passage\nThe sea crossing is brutal—winter storms, high waves, days of seasickness. No one is in danger of death, but the experience is miserable. Lucia's recovery suffers a setback; Bianca cries constantly; Catalina is terrified. By the time they reach Spain, the family needs extended rest before continuing overland. The journey takes much longer than planned.\n16-25\nDifficult Journey\nMultiple problems accumulate—bad weather, minor illnesses, poor roads, inadequate lodgings in places. Nothing catastrophic, but the journey is exhausting and unpleasant. Lucia grows short-tempered; the children are fussy; Juan spends much of the trip managing small crises. They arrive in Toledo worn and weary, grateful to be home.\n26-40\nChallenging but Manageable\nThe journey has its difficulties, as winter travel always does. Some rough days at sea, some cold nights on the road, some moments of worry when Bianca develops a cough or Catalina refuses to eat. But the slow pace and good resources see them through. They arrive tired but healthy, the journey a trial but not a trauma.\n41-60\nUneventful Journey\nThe journey proceeds as well as winter travel can. The sea crossing has some rough patches but nothing dangerous. The overland route is cold but passable. The children handle travel better than expected. Lucia recovers her strength gradually along the way. They arrive in Toledo in reasonable condition, glad to be home but none the worse for the experience.\n61-75\nSmooth Passage\nFortune favors them. The weather holds better than expected for the season; the sea crossing is calm; the roads are passable. Good lodgings are found at each stop. Bianca sleeps through much of the journey; Catalina treats it as an adventure. Lucia arrives in Toledo feeling stronger than when she left Naples. A journey that could have been difficult proves pleasant.\n76-85\nPleasant Journey\nEverything aligns well. Mild weather, calm seas, comfortable accommodations. The slow pace becomes almost leisurely—time for Juan and Lucia to talk, for Catalina to explore new places, for the family to simply be together without crisis or duty. They arrive in Toledo rested and content, the journey a happy memory rather than an ordeal.\n86-95\nExcellent Passage\nThe journey becomes a gift. Perfect weather for the season, smooth sailing, warm welcomes at every port and town. Bianca thrives; Catalina charms everyone she meets; Lucia blossoms back to full health. The family bonds during the long days of travel. They arrive in Toledo in better condition than they left Naples—healthy, happy, and united.\n96-100\nBlessed Homecoming\nProvidence smiles on the journey. Extraordinary weather, calm seas, joyful receptions. Word of Juan's return precedes them; crowds gather to see the king who conquered Granada and saved Constantinople. Bianca is healthy and beautiful; Catalina waves at the cheering people; Lucia rides into Toledo radiant and proud. The journey becomes a triumphal procession, a homecoming fit for legend.\n\nReady to roll when you are.",

It started this morning—I thought it was just the cold air, but it has persisted.\"\n\nShe hastens to add: \"It does not seem serious. She is eating well, playing normally, no fever that I can detect. But with the infant and the Queen...\"\n\nShe leaves the implication unspoken. A minor cough in a healthy toddler is nothing. But coughs spread. Bianca is only three months old. Lucia is still regaining her strength.\n\nYou find Catalina in the inn's common room, playing with a wooden horse one of the soldiers carved for her. She looks up at your approach, smiles, and then coughs—a small, wet sound, followed by a sniffle.\n\n\"Papa, look,\" she says, holding up the horse. \"It's a fast horse.

Then we can see how this plays out over the next few days of travel.\n\nCatalina's eyes light up at the word \"game.\"\n\n\"A running away game?\" She bounces on her heels, the wooden horse momentarily forgotten. \"I'm good at running!\"\n\nShe coughs again—a small, rattling thing—then continues without pause: \"But why we run from Mama and baby?\"\n\nShe frowns, working through the logic with the intensity only a toddler can muster.\n\n\"Is it like hide and seek? Do they try to find us?\" A gasp of excitement. \"Do we hide?\"\n\nShe is already looking around the inn's common room for suitable hiding spots, her imagination racing ahead of any explanation you might offer.\n\nDoña Beatriz watches from nearby, a soft smile on her weathered face.

Fernando - son with Isabel, born August 3, 1433 - Isabel died in childbirth - now about 14-15 months old\n3. Bianca - daughter with Lucia, just born September 1434 - now about 3-4 months old\n\nSo when they arrive in Toledo, they will reunite with Fernando, who has been cared for by Doña Beatriz and others while Juan was away. Actually, Doña Beatriz is traveling WITH them... so Fernando must be with other caretakers in Toledo.\n\nLet me write a touching family reunion scene. Juan hasn't seen Fernando in a long time - he left for Constantinople and Naples. Fernando was born in August 1433, and Juan... let me check when he last saw Fernando.\n\nFrom the summaries, Juan was in Toledo when Fernando was baptized in October 1433. Then he left for Rome, Basel, Constantinople, Naples. So Juan last saw Fernando when he was about 2 months old - at the baptism. Now Fernando is about 14-15 months old. Juan has missed most of his first year.\n\nThis should be an emotional reunion. Fernando won't remember Juan at all - he was too young. Catalina barely remembers him either, but she's been with Juan on the journey. Fernando has been in Toledo the whole time.\n\nLet me write this scene - the family finally united: Juan, Lucia, Catalina, Fernando, and baby Bianca.\n\nTOLEDO — EARLY 1435\n\nThe towers of the Alcázar rise against a pale winter sky as the royal procession approaches the city gates. Word has traveled ahead—crowds line the streets despite the cold, cheering for the king who left to save Constantinople and returns with a new queen and a new princess.\n\nBut Juan's thoughts are not on the crowds.\n\nÁlvaro de Luna waits in the great courtyard, his weathered face breaking into a rare smile as Juan dismounts. Behind him stands the household staff, the guards, the officials who have kept Castile running in his absence.\n\nAnd there, held in the arms of a wet nurse, is Fernando.\n\nJuan's son. Fourteen months old now. Born the day Isabel died—the son Juan has seen only once, at his baptism, when the boy was barely two months old.\n\nFernando has grown. He is no longer the tiny, swaddled bundle Juan remembers. He has dark hair like his mother, and her eyes—Isabel's eyes, the same eyes Catalina carries. He looks at Juan with the open curiosity of a child encountering a stranger.\n\nBecause that is what Juan is to him. A stranger.\n\nLucia hangs back, Bianca in her arms, understanding without being told that this moment belongs to Juan and his firstborn son. Catalina tugs at Juan's hand.\n\n\"Papa, who is that baby?\"\n\n\"That is your brother, mija. Fernando. Do you remember? I told you about him.\"\n\nCatalina studies the boy with the same suspicious scrutiny she applied to Bianca. \"He's bigger than Bianca.\"\n\n\"He is older. He has been waiting here for us to come home.\"\n\nJuan approaches the wet nurse and she curtsies, offering Fernando to him. The boy looks uncertain, glancing back at the only caregivers he has known. His lower lip trembles.\n\nJuan takes his son in his arms for only the second time.\n\nFernando stares at him—this large stranger with the tired eyes and the travel-worn clothes. For a long moment, neither moves.\n\nThen Fernando reaches out a small hand and touches Juan's beard, fascinated by the texture.\n\n\"Papa,\" Catalina announces helpfully, pointing at Juan. \"That's Papa. He's nice. He's a good horse.\"\n\nFernando blinks, processing this information. His hand remains tangled in Juan's beard.\n\nLucia steps forward now, Bianca stirring in her arms.\n\n\"Fernando,\" she says softly, her Italian accent wrapping around the Spanish name. \"I am Lucia. I am...\" She glances at Juan. \"I am going to help take care of you.\"\n\nShe does not say mother. She will not claim that title uninvited. But her eyes are gentle as she looks at the boy who will never know the woman who died bringing him into the world.\n\nThe four of them stand together in the courtyard of the Alcázar—Juan holding Fernando, Lucia holding Bianca, Catalina clinging to Juan's leg.\n\nA family.\n\nBroken and remade. Marked by loss. But together at last.\n\nÁlvaro clears his throat softly.\n\n\"Your Majesty. Welcome home. There is much to discuss, when you are ready. But it can wait.\" His eyes move across the family tableau, and something like warmth flickers in his usually guarded expression. \"It can wait.\"",

I will have everything prepared.\"\n\nHe withdraws, taking the business of the kingdom with him. For one evening, Castile can wait.\n\nTHE FIRST MEAL\n\nThe private dining chamber in the Alcázar has been prepared hastily—servants scrambling to accommodate a family that did not exist when Juan left for Constantinople. A fire roars in the hearth against the January chill. Candles cast warm light across the table.\n\nThe crostata arrives as requested—a proper Italian crostata di marmellata, the pastry latticed over quince jam. The cook has done his best with an unfamiliar recipe, working from hurried instructions. It is not perfect. But when it is set before Lucia, her eyes widen.\n\n\"You remembered,\" she says softly.\n\n\"You complained about Neapolitan pastries for three months. I paid attention.\"\n\nShe laughs—the first real laugh he has heard from her since the birth. \"I complained about everything for three months. The heat. The food. The physicians. You.\" She takes a bite of the crostata and closes her eyes. \"This is... acceptable. The cook needs practice. But acceptable.\"\n\nFrom her, this is high praise.\n\nCatalina sits in a chair piled with cushions to bring her to table height, attacking her portion of roast chicken with more enthusiasm than technique. Fernando, in a nurse's lap nearby, watches the proceedings with wide eyes, gnawing on a piece of soft bread.\n\nBianca sleeps in a cradle by the fire, oblivious to it all.\n\n\"Catalina,\" Lucia says, \"use your knife, not your fingers.\"\n\n\"But fingers are faster.\"\n\n\"Ladies do not—\" Lucia stops herself, glancing at Juan with a wry expression. \"I sound like my aunt. God help me.\"\n\nThe meal is chaos. Catalina chatters endlessly about the journey, about her horse game with Papa, about the wooden horse the soldier made her. Fernando drops his bread and wails until it is retrieved. Bianca wakes and demands feeding, and Lucia excuses herself briefly to the wet nurse.\n\nIt is loud and messy and utterly without the dignity befitting a royal household.\n\nJuan cannot remember the last time he felt this content.\n\nLater, when the children have been taken to their beds and the servants have cleared the table, Juan and Lucia sit alone by the fire. She holds a cup of wine—her first since before the pregnancy—and stares into the flames.\n\n\"Toledo is colder than I expected,\" she says.\n\n\"You will grow accustomed to it.\"\n\n\"Mm.\" She sips her wine. \"The Alcázar is impressive. Older than anything in Ferrara. I can feel the history in the stones.\" A pause. \"I can feel Isabel in the stones, too.\"\n\nJuan says nothing.\n\n\"Her portrait hangs in the gallery. I saw it when we entered.\" Lucia's voice is careful, neutral. \"She was beautiful. More beautiful than I expected.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Catalina has her eyes.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nLucia is quiet for a long moment. Then she reaches over and takes Juan's hand.\n\n\"I am not her,\" she says simply. \"I will not try to be. But I will love her children as my own, and I will build something new in this place.\" She squeezes his fingers. \"That is what I can offer.\"\n\nJuan raises her hand to his lips.\n\n\"That is enough.\"\n\nThe next morning, Juan meets with Álvaro for council.\n\nWhat matters does Juan wish to address?",

The poet-diplomat carries himself with quiet authority.\n\nSir Thomas Beaumont — English knight, now leading the Royal Military Academy. He sits slightly apart, the foreigner among Castilians.\n\nArchbishop Juan de Cerezuela — Archbishop of Toledo, Primate of Spain, and Álvaro's half-brother. He represents the Church's interests at court.\n\nCaptain Fernán Alonso de Robles — Commander of the royal guard, present for matters of security.\n\nThey rise as Juan enters and remain standing until he takes his seat at the head of the table.\n\nÁlvaro speaks first, as is his role: \"Your Majesty. It is good to have you home. The kingdom has been stable in your absence, but there is much to report—and much that requires your decision.\"\n\nHe glances at the other councilors, then back to Juan.\n\n\"Where would you like to begin?\"",

Alfonso provided some supply but there would still be Castilian expenses\n\nKey costs to consider:\n- Transport of 15,000 men from Castile to Palermo (Sicily)\n- Supply and provisions for the army\n- Pay for soldiers (if any - noble levies might serve for crusade duty)\n- Naval transport costs\n- Equipment, weapons, horses\n- Casualties and their compensation\n\nLet me think about who would answer this. Diego de Daza handles financial reforms and treasury matters. Álvaro would have overseen the overall organization.\n\nI should have Diego de Daza or Álvaro present the costs. I need to be careful not to invent specific numbers without the player's input, but I can present the general categories of expenses and perhaps ask for a roll to determine how well the operation was managed financially, or present reasonable estimates based on medieval military economics.\n\nActually, I should present the information and let Juan respond. Let me have Diego de Daza or Álvaro present the financial picture.\n\nFrom previous project knowledge, we know:\n- The Kingdom of Castile 1433 guide shows projected revenues of ~175,679 florins annually\n- Treasury reserves were around 544,500 florins (crown + crusade combined)\n- The 40,000 florins were already sent to Alfonso for hiring Sforza\n- Naval costs for galleys and carracks were committed\n\nLet me have Diego de Daza present what he knows about the costs, acknowledging that this was an extraordinary operation.\n\nDiego de Daza straightens in his chair, pulling a ledger from his stack. His methodical nature is evident in the way he organizes his papers before speaking.\n\n\"Your Majesty, the Naples expedition was... unprecedented in its logistical demands. Allow me to present the accounting as we have it.\"\n\nHe traces a finger down his columns.\n\n\"The assembly itself proceeded smoothly—Don Íñigo can speak to the military aspects. But from the treasury's perspective, the costs were substantial.\"\n\nTransport Costs:\n\"Fifteen thousand men required transport from Castile to Palermo. We chartered Aragonese and Genoese vessels—King Alfonso assisted with some ships, but the bulk of the cost fell to us. Ship hire, provisioning for the voyage, replacement of horses lost at sea...\"\n\nSupply and Provisions:\n\"King Alfonso was indeed generous with supply once the army reached Sicily and Naples. But the initial provisioning—food, fodder, ammunition, medical supplies—was borne by the crown. An army of that size consumes enormously.\"\n\nNoble Levies:\n\"The levies served without direct pay, as is their feudal obligation for campaign service. However, we compensated losses—horses, equipment, men-at-arms who fell. The battle at Aversa was decisive but not without cost.\"\n\nHe looks up from his ledger.\n\n\"In total, Your Majesty, the Naples expedition cost the crown approximately...\"\n\nHe pauses, waiting for Juan's attention.\n\n\"Forty-two thousand florins. This does not include the forty thousand previously sent to King Alfonso for the Sforza contract.\"\n\nÁlvaro interjects quietly: \"Eighty-two thousand florins total committed to securing Naples for Aragón.\"\n\nDiego nods. \"The treasury remains healthy, Your Majesty. But it is a significant expenditure. Shall I detail the current balances?\"",

La Dote de la Reina Isabel was paid as a lump sum (25,000 florins endowment), not annual disbursements from the crown\n3. The 2,000 florins for Rhodes comes from Constantinople treasury, not Castile\n4. The 60,000 for Constantinople walls also came from the crusade/joint treasury\n5. The main Castilian crown expenses are the Naples campaign and journey costs\n\nLet me think about what the correct accounting should be:\n\nFrom the Kingdom of Castile 1433 document:\n- Crusade Treasury: ~315,500 florins\n- Crown Treasury: ~229,000 florins projected\n\nThe 60,000 for Constantinople walls was Juan's personal commitment from the crusade treasury/joint treasury, not from Castile's crown treasury.\n\nLa Dote de la Reina Isabel - yes, this was established as a perpetual endowment of 25,000 florins. The annual disbursements (80-130 dowries of ~15 florins each) come from the endowment's interest/returns, not from the crown treasury each year.\n\nThe user is correct that Diego may be confusing things. Let me have Diego acknowledge this and clarify the actual crown expenses.\n\nThe real one-time expenses for the Castilian crown treasury in 1434 would be:\n1. Naples expedition: ~42,000 florins (transport, supply, compensation for losses)\n2. The 40,000 florins sent to Alfonso for Sforza\n3. Journey costs (supplies, wages for crew - these would be relatively modest since they own the ships)\n\nSo total: roughly 82,000+ florins for the Naples affair plus journey costs.\n\nThe Constantinople expenses (60,000 for walls, 2,000 for Rhodes) came from the crusade treasury which was always designated for crusading purposes and has been largely transferred to the joint treasury in Constantinople.\n\nI'll admit my previous accounting was imprecise. The expenses were more nuanced than I initially presented, particularly regarding the crusade and joint treasury allocations. I appreciate the clarification and will ensure more accurate financial reporting moving forward.\n\nDiego de Daza pauses, then nods slowly, a flush of embarrassment creeping up his neck.\n\n\"Your Majesty is correct. I apologize for the confusion.\"\n\nHe flips through his ledger, making notations.\n\n\"La Dote de la Reina Isabel—yes, the twenty-five thousand florins was established as a perpetual endowment. The annual disbursements come from the endowment's own returns, not from crown funds. I misspoke.\"\n\nHe strikes a line through something in his records.\n\n\"And the Constantinople expenditures—the sixty thousand for the walls, the two thousand for Rhodes—these were drawn from the crusade treasury, which Your Majesty transferred to the joint administration with the Emperor. That is Byzantine-Castilian money now, not crown revenue.\"\n\nÁlvaro watches Diego with a trace of amusement. The administrator is meticulous but sometimes loses sight of which pot of money is which.\n\nDiego looks up, his expression more confident now.\n\n\"So, to correct myself: the true one-time burden on the Castilian crown treasury for 1434 is the Naples expedition—forty-two thousand florins in transport, supply, and compensation, plus the forty thousand sent earlier for the Sforza contract. Eighty-two thousand total for Naples.\"\n\nHe consults another page.\n\n\"Journey costs for the royal fleet—supplies, crew wages, port fees—perhaps another three to four thousand florins over the course of the year.\"\n\nHe sets down his quill.\n\n\"Approximately eighty-five to eighty-six thousand florins in extraordinary expenses, Your Majesty. The crown treasury can bear this, but it is not insignificant.\"",

This is a roleplay question directed at the council members. I should not generate Juan's dialogue, but I should have the council members respond to this question.\n\nThe question is reasonable - Granada was conquered in 1433, and by 1434/1435 it would have been settled. The Military Orders have commanderies there, new lords have taken over estates, and the Moorish population has either converted, left, or been settled. The need for a large garrison would naturally decrease.\n\nLet me have the council respond to this question realistically.\n\n\nDon Íñigo López de Mendoza straightens in his chair, as the question falls within his expertise as both a military commander and a member of the Council of Great Houses.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty raises a fair point. The situation in Granada has changed substantially since the conquest.\"\n\n\nHe steeples his fingers, considering.\n\n\n\"In the first year, eleven thousand men were necessary. The population was uncertain, pockets of resistance remained in the mountains, and the new lords had not yet established their authority. We needed overwhelming presence to prevent rebellion before it could begin.\"\n\n\nHe glances at Álvaro, who nods for him to continue.\n\n\n\"Now? The Military Orders hold their commanderies and have brought their own men. The new lords have settled their estates and raised local levies. The Moorish population that remained has largely accepted the new order—those who would not have fled to North Africa or the mountains, and the mountain bandits are a matter for local forces, not crown troops.\"\n\n\nSir Thomas Beaumont adds, from his perspective as a military man: \"Garrison duty rots soldiers, Your Majesty. Men who sit in conquered cities grow soft and resentful. The best of them would rather be training at the Academy or serving where there is purpose.\"\n\n\nÁlvaro de Luna speaks carefully: \"The question is not whether we need eleven thousand men in Granada. We do not. The question is how many we should retain, and what becomes of the rest.\"\n\n\nHe counts on his fingers: \"Some can be disbanded—returned to their homes. Some can be retained as a reduced garrison, perhaps two or three thousand, to maintain crown presence and respond to any local troubles. And some...\" He pauses, glancing at Juan. \"Some might be repositioned for other purposes. The Constantinople commitment, perhaps. Or held in reserve for future needs.\"\n\n\nDiego de Daza's eyes light up at the financial implications. \"Eleven thousand troops at the rates we pay costs the crown nearly twenty-six thousand florins annually. Reducing to three thousand would save approximately seventeen thousand florins per year.\"\n\n\nThe council waits for Juan's direction.",

This is a reasonable question about feudal obligations versus crown expenditure.\n\nLet me think about who Don García López de Padilla is and what forces he might have:\n- He's the Master of the Order of Calatrava (I believe)\n- As Governor of Granada, he has administrative authority\n- The Military Orders have their own troops\n- New lords granted lands in Granada would have their own levies\n\nThe council should respond to this question. The key points:\n1. The Military Orders (Santiago, Calatrava, Alcántara) now hold commanderies in Granada with their own troops\n2. New nobles granted lands have feudal obligations to maintain order\n3. The Governor himself likely has forces from his Order\n4. Crown troops are an additional layer that may no longer be necessary\n\nThis is a sensible feudal arrangement - the lords who hold the land are responsible for keeping the peace, not the crown directly. The crown only intervenes if local lords cannot handle a situation.\n\nLet me have the council respond to this.\n\n\nÁlvaro exchanges a glance with Don Íñigo. There is a flicker of something—approval, perhaps—at the king's instinct toward feudal rather than centralized solutions.\n\n\nDon Íñigo speaks first: \"Don García López de Padilla is Master of the Order of Calatrava. He commands the Order's own forces—several hundred knights and men-at-arms. And the Order now holds substantial commanderies in Granada, as do Santiago and Alcántara.\"\n\n\nHe begins counting the forces available to the Governor without crown expense:\n\n\n\"The three Military Orders together maintain perhaps fifteen hundred to two thousand men in their Granadan holdings. The new lords—those who received grants for their service in the crusade—owe feudal levies. If summoned, they could raise another two to three thousand from their estates.\"\n\n\nÁlvaro nods slowly. \"Your Majesty's instinct is sound. The purpose of granting titles and lands is precisely this—the lord defends what is his. If we pay crown soldiers to do what the lords should do themselves, we teach them that the crown will bear their burdens.\"\n\n\nArchbishop Cerezuela adds, his voice dry: \"And we impoverish ourselves in the process, while they grow fat on rents they do not earn through service.\"\n\n\nSir Thomas Beaumont leans forward. \"In England, the crown maintains few permanent garrisons. The lords hold the land; the lords defend the land. The crown calls the banners when war comes. It is... more economical.\"\n\n\nDiego de Daza is practically vibrating with restrained enthusiasm at the prospect of eliminating a twenty-six thousand florin expense.\n\n\nÁlvaro raises a cautionary hand. \"There is one consideration, Your Majesty. A small crown presence—perhaps a few hundred men, a royal banner in Granada city—reminds both the new lords and the remaining Moorish population that the king's eye is upon them. Not enough to do the lords' work for them. Enough to show that Granada remains part of Castile, not a collection of independent fiefdoms.\"\n\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\n\"Perhaps five hundred men? A token force, costing no more than... \" He glances at Diego.\n\n\n\"Twelve hundred florins,\" Diego supplies instantly. \"Perhaps fifteen hundred with officers and maintenance.\"\n\n\nThe council watches Juan, awaiting his decision.",

Let me think through this carefully.\n\nCurrently, Granada is governed by Don García López de Padilla, Master of the Order of Calatrava, who serves as Governor. He administers on behalf of the crown. The crown collects the revenues (taxes, customs, etc.) from Granada.\n\nIf Juan creates a Duke of Granada, several things could change depending on how the title is structured:\n\n1. **Titular Duke (title only, no lands)**: The duke gets prestige and a seat at high councils, but the crown retains all revenues and direct administration. This is mostly honorific.\n\n2. **Duke with lands and rights**: The duke receives some or all of Granada as his duchy. He would:\n   - Collect taxes from his lands (or a portion of them)\n   - Administer justice (or share it with the crown)\n   - Raise his own levies\n   - Owe the crown feudal service and possibly a portion of revenues\n   - Effectively become a powerful vassal\n\n3. **Duke with limited rights**: Something in between - perhaps the title comes with certain estates but not the entire kingdom, or the duke administers but must remit most revenues to the crown.\n\nThe financial implications:\n- If it's a full duchy with rights, the crown loses direct taxation from Granada but gains:\n  - A powerful vassal obligated to defend the territory\n  - Reduced administrative costs\n  - Feudal dues and services\n  \nThe political implications:\n- Creating a Duke of Granada creates a very powerful noble\n- This person could become a rival or a loyal pillar of the realm\n- The Infantes (Juan's cousins) might covet such a title\n- It's a major piece of patronage\n\nCurrently, based on the 1433 finances, I don't see Granada broken out as a separate revenue line - it seems to be included in the base crown revenue. The \"Mediterranean Commerce\" line of 5,000 florins is specifically from Málaga customs.\n\n\nI should have the council explain these options and implications without making the decision for Juan.\n\nThe council will present a nuanced overview, highlighting the strategic considerations without overtly pushing Juan toward a specific choice. They'll outline the potential benefits and risks of each ducal arrangement, allowing him to weigh the political and financial consequences carefully. By providing a balanced perspective, they ensure Juan can make an informed decision that serves the kingdom's broader interests.\n\n\nThe council stirs at this question. It touches on fundamental matters of governance, feudal rights, and the relationship between crown and nobility.\n\n\nÁlvaro de Luna speaks carefully, as this is precisely his area of expertise: \"Your Majesty, much depends on how the title is granted and what rights accompany it.\"\n\n\nHe rises and moves to a map on the wall showing the former Emirate.\n\n\n\"There are several possibilities.\"\n\n\n\nOption One: A Titular Dukedom\n\n\n\"The title of Duke of Granada could be granted as an honor only—prestige, precedence at court, a seat on the Council of Great Houses. But the crown retains direct administration, direct taxation, direct authority. The duke is duke in name; the king rules in fact.\"\n\n\nHe shrugs. \"This costs nothing and changes little. But it is also... a thin gift. Men know the difference between a title with teeth and a title without.\"\n\n\n\nOption Two: A Dukedom with Full Rights\n\n\n\"Alternatively, you could create a true duchy—the duke holds Granada as his domain. He collects taxes, administers justice, raises levies. He owes the crown feudal service and perhaps a fixed annual payment, but the day-to-day revenues are his.\"\n\n\nDon Íñigo interjects: \"This is how the great duchies of France operate. The Duke of Burgundy, the Duke of Brittany—they are near-kings in their own lands.\"\n\n\nÁlvaro nods grimly. \"And therein lies the danger. A Duke of Granada with full rights commands the wealthiest, most fertile territory in Castile outside the heartland. He has ports, trade, a defensible position. Give this to the wrong man, and you create a rival. Give it to the right man...\" He pauses. \"And you still create someone powerful enough to be a rival to his grandchildren, if not to you.\"\n\n\nDiego de Daza clears his throat. \"The revenue implications would be substantial, Your Majesty. Granada's contribution to crown revenues—including Málaga customs, the alcabala from trade, agricultural taxes—is perhaps thirty to forty thousand florins annually once fully integrated. If a duke takes this, the crown loses it, save for whatever fixed payment is negotiated.\"\n\n\n\nOption Three: A Limited Dukedom\n\n\nArchbishop Cerezuela speaks up: \"There is a middle path. The duke receives certain estates, certain rights, certain revenues—but not all of Granada. The crown retains the major cities, the ports, the customs. The duke holds rural lands and the obligation to defend them.\"\n\n\nÁlvaro nods. \"This is how Your Majesty has already distributed much of Granada—to the Military Orders, to crusade veterans. A Duke of Granada could be first among these lords, with authority to coordinate defense and settle disputes, but not sovereign over them.\"\n\n\n\nDon Íñigo adds quietly: \"There is also the question of who, Your Majesty. The title of Duke of Granada would be the highest in the realm after the crown itself. Whoever receives it becomes the most powerful noble in Castile. This is not merely a financial decision.\"\n\n\nThe council falls silent, watching Juan.",

Slowly, steadily, without drama.

No lord may levy them without explicit royal charter, and Your Majesty has granted no such charters.\"\n\n\nHe begins laying out the picture:\n\n\n\nSeville\n\n\n\"The great prize. Gateway to the Atlantic, the wool trade with Flanders, trade with Portugal and England. Seville's customs generate approximately forty thousand florins annually—more than any other single source save the alcabala itself.\"\n\n\nHe taps the ledger. \"This has been stable for years. Growth is possible if we improve harbor facilities, but Seville is already near capacity during peak trading seasons. Ships sometimes wait days to unload.\"\n\n\n\nMálaga\n\n\n\"The new opportunity. As I mentioned, we began at five thousand florins in 1433. I project eight to ten thousand for 1434.\" His eyes gleam. \"But Málaga's potential is far greater. It is the natural gateway between the Mediterranean and the Castilian interior. Goods that now travel overland from Valencia or Barcelona could come through Málaga instead—if we build the roads and establish the reputation.\"\n\n\nHe pauses. \"In five years, with continued investment, Málaga could rival Seville. Twenty to thirty thousand florins annually is not impossible.\"\n\n\n\nCádiz and the Atlantic Ports\n\n\n\"Smaller but steady. Cádiz, Sanlúcar de Barrameda, the fishing ports—together perhaps twelve thousand florins. The wine trade, the salt trade, fishing rights.\" He shrugs. \"These will not grow dramatically, but they are reliable.\"\n\n\n\nBilbao and the Northern Ports\n\n\n\"The iron trade, wool exports to England and Flanders through the Cantabrian ports. Another fifteen thousand florins, roughly. The Basque shipbuilders bring additional revenue—perhaps three thousand in duties on timber and naval supplies.\"\n\n\n\nInternal Tolls\n\n\n\"River crossings, major road junctions, market fees in royal towns. Scattered and difficult to track precisely, but perhaps eight thousand florins total.\"\n\n\n\nDiego sets down his quill and summarizes:\n\n\n\"Total trade revenues across the kingdom: approximately seventy-eight to eighty thousand florins annually, Your Majesty. Of this, perhaps sixty-five thousand is stable and predictable. The remainder—particularly Málaga—is where growth lies.\"\n\n\nÁlvaro adds: \"And crucially, these revenues are crown revenues. They do not diminish when you grant lands to lords. A duke may collect rents from his peasants, but the customs at Málaga remain yours.\"\n\n\nDiego nods eagerly. \"This is why the Mediterranean commerce initiative matters so much, Your Majesty. Every florin invested in ports and trade infrastructure returns to the crown directly, without passing through noble hands.\"",

Let me think about what has changed from 1433:\n\n**Changes from 1433 to 1434:**\n\n1. **Granada Garrison** - Was 25,781 florins for 11,000 troops. Juan has now reduced this to just 50 soldiers at the Alhambra plus some tax assessors and crown marshals. Let's estimate this at maybe 500-800 florins total (50 soldiers + small staff).\n\n2. **Queen's Household** - Isabel's household is gone (she died in 1433). Lucia's household is now full year - so 2,000 florins annually.\n\n3. **Naples Campaign** - This is a one-time expense for 1434: 42,000 florins (transport, supply, compensation)\n\n4. **Journey costs** - 3,000-4,000 florins for the royal fleet journey\n\n5. **The 40,000 to Alfonso for Sforza** - This was spent in 1433, NOT 1434, so we don't include it here.\n\n6. **Constantinople aid (60,000)** - This was 1433, not 1434.\n\n7. **Naval Carracks (58,000)** - This was 1433, not 1434.\n\n8. **La Dote de la Reina Isabel (25,000)** - This was a one-time endowment in 1433, not 1434.\n\n9. **Granada Integration (5,000)** - This was 1433.\n\n10. **Royal Wedding** - This was 1433.\n\nLet me reconstruct what the 1434 expenses would look like based on the 1433 structure but with the changes:\n\n**ROYAL HOUSEHOLD:**\n- Palace Staff: 4,500\n- Royal Guard: 3,000\n- Food & Provisions: 3,500\n- Clothing & Livery: 1,500\n\n\n- Heating, Lighting, Maintenance: 2,000\n- Secondary Residences: 1,500\n- Ceremonies & Feasts: 2,500\n- Stables & Transport: 1,200\n- Queen Lucia's Household (full year): 2,000\n\nI'll consolidate the household expenses, noting that children's households seem minimal or already included in the existing budget. The military expenses for Granada have dramatically decreased, reflecting the significant reduction in garrison size and ongoing presence.\n\nMilitary expenditures now focus on strategic maintenance, with frontier fortress upkeep potentially scaling back as local lords assume more defensive responsibilities. The Royal Military Academy remains a substantial investment, alongside provisions for crown soldiers, equipment replacement, and intelligence operations.\n\nAdministrative costs remain substantial, with extensive networks of tax collectors, royal officials, and judicial administrators maintaining the kingdom's bureaucratic infrastructure. Diplomatic efforts continue through permanent embassies and strategic delegations, while religious allocations support chaplaincy, charitable works, and ecclesiastical development.\n\nThe budget reflects a strategic downsizing and redistribution of resources, prioritizing efficiency and local governance while maintaining key institutional capabilities.\n\nInfrastructure investments target critical transportation and maritime improvements. Financial obligations include loan management, noble compensations, and pension commitments. A robust contingency fund addresses potential unexpected expenses and military emergencies.\n\nThe most significant expenditure is the Naples Campaign, representing a major military undertaking in 1434, supplemented by substantial royal fleet expenditures.\n\n\nDiego de Daza nods and begins drafting the expense ledger for 1434, incorporating the changes Juan has ordered.\n\n\n\nKINGDOM OF CASTILE — CROWN EXPENSES 1434 (Projected)\n\n\nROYAL HOUSEHOLD\n\nItem\nAmount (Florins)\nType\nNotes\nPalace Staff (Toledo Alcázar)\n4,500\nAnnual\n~150 servants, cooks, stable hands\nRoyal Guard (personal protection)\n3,000\nAnnual\n~60 elite guards\nFood & Provisions (court)\n3,500\nAnnual\nDaily provisions for royal household\nClothing & Livery\n1,500\nAnnual\nRoyal wardrobe, staff uniforms\nHeating, Lighting, Maintenance\n2,000\nAnnual\nFuel, candles, repairs\nSecondary Residences\n1,500\nAnnual\nSegovia, Valladolid upkeep\nCeremonies & Feasts\n2,500\nAnnual\nCourt celebrations, receptions\nStables & Transport\n1,200\nAnnual\nHorses, carriages, fodder\nQueen Lucia's Household\n2,000\nAnnual\nFull year\nRoyal Children's Household\n800\nAnnual\nFernando, Catalina, Bianca\nSubtotal: Royal Household\n22,500\n\n\nMILITARY (REGULAR)\n\nItem\nAmount (Florins)\nType\nNotes\nAlhambra Garrison\n800\nAnnual\n50 soldiers + staff (REDUCED from 25,781)\nFrontier Fortress Maintenance\n1,500\nAnnual\nReduced - local lords now responsible\nRoyal Military Academy\n7,500\nAnnual\nFaculty, facilities, training\nCrown Soldiers (non-garrison)\n6,000\nAnnual\n~150 professional soldiers\nArms & Equipment Replacement\n2,500\nAnnual\nWeapons, armor maintenance\nMilitary Intelligence\n1,500\nAnnual\nScouts, informants, Morocco network\nSubtotal: Military\n19,800\n\n\nADMINISTRATION\n\nItem\nAmount (Florins)\nType\nNotes\nRoyal Chancery\n3,500\nAnnual\nScribes, secretaries, records\nTax Collectors (Diego de Daza's staff)\n5,000\nAnnual\n~200 collectors\nCrown Marshals (12)\n630\nAnnual\n52.5 florins each\nCorregidores & Royal Officials\n4,000\nAnnual\nCrown representatives\nMessengers & Couriers\n1,500\nAnnual\nRoyal communication network\nReal Chancillería (appeals court)\n2,500\nAnnual\nJudges, staff, facilities\nLocal Justice Administration\n1,500\nAnnual\nCrown share of court costs\nSubtotal: Administration\n18,630\n\n\nDIPLOMATIC & FOREIGN\n\nItem\nAmount (Florins)\nType\nNotes\nPermanent Embassies\n2,000\nAnnual\nRome, Aragon, Portugal\nDiplomatic Gifts\n1,500\nAnnual\nGifts to foreign courts\nBasel Delegation (ongoing)\n3,000\nAnnual\nCastilian delegation at Council\nSubtotal: Diplomatic\n6,500\n\n\nRELIGIOUS OBLIGATIONS\n\nItem\nAmount (Florins)\nType\nNotes\nRoyal Chaplains & Chapel\n1,200\nAnnual\nChaplain corps, maintenance\nAlms & Charitable Donations\n2,000\nAnnual\nRoyal charity, poor relief\nChurch Construction Contributions\n1,500\nAnnual\nSeville Cathedral, others\nMonasteries & Religious Houses\n800\nAnnual\nRoyal patronage\nSubtotal: Religious\n5,500\n\n\nINFRASTRUCTURE\n\nItem\nAmount (Florins)\nType\nNotes\nRoyal Roads Maintenance\n1,000\nAnnual\nCaminos reales upkeep\nBridge Repairs\n500\nAnnual\nCritical crossings\nHarbor Improvements (Málaga)\n1,500\nAnnual\nMediterranean commerce\nSubtotal: Infrastructure\n3,000\n\n\nFINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS\n\nItem\nAmount (Florins)\nType\nNotes\nInterest on Outstanding Loans\n2,000\nAnnual\nReduced due to windfall\nNoble Compensations\n3,000\nAnnual\nPer Cortes agreements\nPension Obligations\n1,500\nAnnual\nRetired officials, widows\nSubtotal: Financial\n6,500\n\n\nCONTINGENCY\n\nItem\nAmount (Florins)\nType\nNotes\nUnexpected Expenses Reserve\n5,000\nAnnual\n~3% of regular budget\nEmergency Military Fund\n3,000\nAnnual\nRapid response capability\nSubtotal: Contingency\n8,000\n\n\nONE-TIME EXPENSES (1434)\n\nItem\nAmount (Florins)\nType\nNotes\nNaples Campaign\n42,000\nOne-time\nTransport, supply, compensation\nRoyal Fleet Journey\n4,000\nOne-time\nConstantinople-Rhodes-Naples-Toledo\nSubtotal: One-Time\n46,000\n\n\nEXPENSE SUMMARY 1434\n\nCategory\nAmount (Florins)\nAnnual/Recurring Expenses\n90,430\nOne-Time Expenses\n46,000\nGRAND TOTAL EXPENSES 1434\n136,430\n\n\nDiego looks up from the parchment, barely containing his satisfaction.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, the reduction of the Granada garrison alone saves the crown nearly twenty-five thousand florins.

      "text": "Thought process: Synthesized historical revenue data to project 1434 finances.\n\nThe user wants me to list the projected revenue for 1434. Let me compile this based on what we've discussed and the 1433 finances file.\n\nFrom the 1433 file, the base revenues were:\n- Base Crown Revenue: 179,094 (regular taxation - alcabala, servicios, tercias, etc.)\n- Mediterranean Commerce (Year 1): 5,000 (Málaga customs)\n- Council Compliance Improvements: 23,000 (voluntary noble cooperation)\n- Crusade Taxation (Jan-Apr): 7,500 (ended with Te Deum April 5)\n- Resumed Noble Taxation (May-Dec): 18,000\n\nFor 1434, we need to consider:\n1. Base Crown Revenue - this should remain similar or slightly improved with Diego's efficiency gains (he mentioned 5-8 thousand increase possible)\n2. Mediterranean Commerce - Year 2, projected 8,000-10,000 (up from 5,000)\n3. Council Compliance - should continue at 23,000 or slightly higher\n4. No more crusade taxation - that ended\n5. Full year of noble taxation - so the 7,500 + 18,000 becomes a full year amount\n\nBut wait, I need to be careful here. The trade revenues Diego just listed (86,000-88,000) - are those separate from the \"Base Crown Revenue\" of 179,094? Let me think about this...\n\nLooking at the original 1433 finances:\n- Base Crown Revenue: 179,094 (regular taxation - alcabala, servicios, tercias, etc.)\n- Mediterranean Commerce: 5,000 (Málaga customs initiative)\n\nSo the Mediterranean Commerce of 5,000 was listed separately from the 179,094 base revenue. This suggests that the trade revenues might be included in the base revenue figure, except for the new Málaga initiative which was called out separately.\n\nBut then Diego just gave us a detailed breakdown of trade revenues totaling 86,000-88,000. This seems like it should be part of the overall crown revenue structure.\n \nI'll clarify the revenue structure, focusing on the Málaga initiative's growth and how it fits into the overall revenue projection. The key is understanding how the new trade revenues integrate with the existing base revenue framework.\n\nThe Mediterranean Commerce line represents a specific new trade initiative, growing from 5,000 to 8,000-10,000. This incremental growth highlights the potential of targeted economic expansions within the broader revenue strategy.\n\nFor 1434, the projection includes:\n1. Base Crown Revenue with efficiency improvements\n2. Málaga trade expansion\n3. Consistent council compliance contributions\n4. Adjusted noble taxation accounting for full-year regular rates\n\nThe noble taxation calculation requires careful consideration, moving from the mixed crusade and regular rates to a standardized annual projection of around 27,000.\n\n\nDiego de Daza turns to a fresh page and begins compiling the revenue projections for 1434.\n\n\n\nKINGDOM OF CASTILE — CROWN REVENUES 1434 (Projected)\n\n\nBASE CROWN REVENUE\n\nSource\nAmount (Florins)\nNotes\nAlcabala (sales tax)\n85,000\n10% tax on commercial transactions\nServicios (direct tax)\n45,000\nVoted by Cortes\nTercias Reales (church tithe share)\n30,000\nCrown's 2/9 of ecclesiastical tithes\nPedidos & Monedas\n12,000\nTraditional crown levies\nRoyal Monopolies (salt, mines)\n7,094\nSalt works, mineral rights\nSubtotal: Base Revenue\n179,094\nSame as 1433 baseline\n\n\nTRADE REVENUES\n\nSource\nAmount (Florins)\nNotes\nSeville Customs\n40,000\nWool to Flanders, Atlantic trade\nMálaga Customs\n9,000\nYear 2 of initiative (up from 5,000)\nCádiz & Atlantic Ports\n12,000\nWine, salt, fishing\nBilbao & Northern Ports\n15,000\nIron, wool exports\nBasque Shipyards\n3,000\nTimber duties, naval supplies\nInternal Tolls\n8,000\nRiver crossings, roads, markets\nSubtotal: Trade Revenue\n87,000\n\n\nREFORM IMPROVEMENTS\n\nSource\nAmount (Florins)\nNotes\nCouncil Compliance Improvements\n24,000\nNoble cooperation (slight increase)\nCollection Efficiency Gains\n6,000\nDiego's administrative reforms\nSubtotal: Reform Revenue\n30,000\n\n\nNOBLE TAXATION\n\nSource\nAmount (Florins)\nNotes\nRegular Noble Taxation\n27,000\nFull year (no crusade interruption)\nSubtotal: Noble Revenue\n27,000\n\n\nREVENUE SUMMARY 1434\n\nCategory\nAmount (Florins)\nBase Crown Revenue\n179,094\nTrade Revenues\n87,000\nReform Improvements\n30,000\nNoble Taxation\n27,000\nTOTAL PROJECTED REVENUE 1434\n323,094\n\n\nDiego sets down his quill and looks up.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, if these projections hold, the kingdom's position is strong.\"\n\n\nHe quickly calculates:\n\nSummary\nAmount (Florins)\nTotal Revenue\n323,094\nTotal Expenses\n136,430\nNet Surplus 1434\n186,664\n\n\"A surplus of nearly one hundred eighty-seven thousand florins, Your Majesty.

      "text": "Thought process: Orchestrated Diego's methodical infrastructure investment strategy response.\n\nThe user is asking Diego de Daza how he would approach a major infrastructure investment program of 150,000 florins. This is a question about planning and implementation, not about Juan making a decision yet.\n\nI should have Diego respond thoughtfully about how he would structure such a program - considering priorities, phasing, oversight, expected returns, and practical implementation challenges. Diego is a meticulous administrator, so his response should reflect that character.\n\nI should NOT have Juan speak or make decisions - just have Diego (and possibly other council members) respond to the question.\n\n\nDiego de Daza's eyes widen slightly. One hundred fifty thousand florins is an enormous sum—nearly half the annual revenue of the kingdom. But his administrator's mind is already working, and after a moment's thought, he begins to speak.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, an investment of this magnitude requires careful structure. Spent poorly, it vanishes like water into sand. Spent wisely...\" He pauses, gathering his thoughts. \"It transforms the kingdom.\"\n\n\nHe rises and moves to a side table, retrieving a blank sheet of parchment.\n\n\n\"I would approach this in four parts.\"\n\n\n\nFirst: Prioritization\n\n\n\"Not all investments are equal. Some generate returns quickly; others take decades. Some benefit the crown directly; others benefit the kingdom generally, which benefits the crown indirectly.\"\n\n\nHe begins sketching categories:\n\n\n\"Ports and customs infrastructure return money to the crown treasury directly. Every florin spent improving Málaga's harbor generates customs revenue for years to come. This is the highest priority.\"\n\n\n\"Roads and bridges benefit trade, which increases customs revenue and the alcabala. The return is real but indirect. Still, a road from Málaga to Toledo would transform commerce.\"\n\n\n\"Ships serve multiple purposes—war, trade protection, transport. The four carracks built last year already prove their worth. More vessels extend the crown's reach.\"\n\n\n\"Agricultural improvements—irrigation, drainage, mills—increase production on crown estates. The return is slow but permanent.\"\n\n\n\nSecond: Phasing\n\n\n\"One hundred fifty thousand florins cannot be spent wisely in a single year. There are not enough skilled workers, not enough materials, not enough competent overseers.\"\n\n\nHe writes figures as he speaks:\n\n\n\"I would recommend a three-year program. Fifty thousand florins annually, perhaps. This allows each project to be properly supervised, mistakes to be corrected, and results to be assessed before committing further funds.\"\n\n\n\nThird: Oversight\n\n\n\"This is where such programs fail, Your Majesty.\" His voice grows firm. \"Money flows from the treasury to intermediaries to contractors to workers—and at each step, it leaks. Men steal. Men lie about progress. Men deliver inferior work and pocket the difference.\"\n\n\nHe taps the parchment emphatically.\n\n\n\"I would require three things: independent inspectors who answer only to the crown, milestone payments released only when work is verified complete, and severe penalties for fraud—including seizure of assets and imprisonment.\"\n\n\nDon Íñigo López de Mendoza interjects quietly: \"The Military Orders have experience building fortifications. Their discipline might serve as a model—or their engineers could be borrowed for oversight.\"\n\n\nDiego nods. \"An excellent suggestion.\"\n\n\n\nFourth: Expected Returns\n\n\n\"Your Majesty will want to know what such investment yields.\"\n\n\nHe calculates aloud:\n\n\n\"Málaga harbor improvements—ten thousand florins invested might increase customs revenue by two to three thousand annually. A permanent return of twenty to thirty percent.\"\n\n\n\"A proper road from Málaga to Toledo—perhaps forty thousand florins over three years. This could increase trade volume substantially, adding five to eight thousand in customs and alcabala revenues annually.\"\n\n\n\"Additional ships—fourteen thousand florins per carrack. Each vessel earns its cost through trade protection, transport savings, and potential prizes within five to seven years.\"\n\n\nHe looks up from his calculations.\n\n\n\"Properly executed, Your Majesty, a one hundred fifty thousand florin investment program could add fifteen to twenty-five thousand florins in annual revenue within five years. The investment pays for itself within a decade, and then continues paying forever.\"\n\n\n\nÁlvaro de Luna has been listening intently. \"There is also the matter of employment, Your Majesty. Such a program puts men to work—masons, carpenters, laborers, carters. Men with wages spend money. Merchants profit. The alcabala collects its share. The benefits ripple outward.\"\n\n\nDiego nods. \"The Constable speaks truly. The indirect benefits are difficult to calculate but real.\"\n\n\nHe sets down his quill and meets Juan's eyes.\n\n\n\"If Your Majesty wishes, I can prepare a detailed proposal—specific projects, costs, timelines, expected returns. It would take me perhaps two weeks to do properly.\"",

      "text": "Thought process: Examined carracks' dual-purpose viability and historical trade-offs comprehensively.\n\nThe user is asking about naval matters - specifically whether carracks can serve a dual purpose as both trade vessels and warships. This is a good historical question about 15th century naval technology.\n\nLet me think about what I know about carracks:\n\nCarracks (also called \"naus\" in Portuguese/Spanish) were the dominant large sailing ships of the 15th and 16th centuries. They were developed in the 14th-15th century and were characterized by:\n\n1. Large cargo capacity - they could carry substantial amounts of goods\n2. High \"castles\" fore and aft - raised platforms that served as defensive positions\n3. Multiple masts (typically 3-4) with a mix of square and lateen sails\n4. Relatively sturdy construction\n\nThey were indeed dual-purpose vessels in this era. The Portuguese and Spanish used them extensively for both trade and war. The famous ships of exploration (like those used by Columbus, though his were smaller caravels mostly) and the later treasure fleets were carracks or their descendants.\n\nHowever, there were trade-offs:\n- Pure warships (galleys in the Mediterranean) were faster and more maneuverable\n- Pure cargo ships could carry more if they didn't need to accommodate cannons and soldiers\n- Carracks were slower than galleys but could carry more armament\n- Carracks were better for Atlantic sailing; galleys dominated Mediterranean warfare\n\nThe council should be able to discuss this. Sir Thomas Beaumont as a military man might have some input, and perhaps Captain Fernán. But this is really a naval question - does Juan have any naval experts on his council?\n\nI should have the council discuss this realistically, noting both the advantages and disadvantages of carracks for this dual role. The key points:\n\n1. Yes, carracks CAN serve both roles - this was common practice\n2. But there are trade-offs in both directions\n3. Mediterranean vs Atlantic considerations\n4. Cost considerations\n5. Crew requirements - merchant sailors vs fighting men\n6. The state of Castile's current fleet (4 carracks built in 1433)\n \nI'll guide the council discussion to explore the nuanced potential of these versatile vessels, drawing on their collective expertise to provide a comprehensive perspective.\n\n\nThe council stirs at this shift in topic. Naval matters are not the strongest expertise at this table, but several members have relevant knowledge.\n\n\nÁlvaro de Luna speaks first: \"Your Majesty built four carracks last year at considerable expense—fifty-eight thousand florins. They served well in transporting men to Constantinople and Naples. Captain Fernán, you sailed on them. What is your assessment?\"\n\n\nCaptain Fernán straightens. He is a soldier, not a sailor, but he has spent months at sea this past year.\n\n\n\"The carracks are sturdy vessels, Your Majesty. They carried our men and horses safely through rough waters. The sailors speak well of them.\" He pauses, choosing his words carefully. \"But I am no naval expert. I can tell you how they feel under foot, not how they would perform in battle.\"\n\n\nSir Thomas Beaumont leans forward. \"In England, we use similar vessels—large sailing ships that carry cargo in peacetime and mount guns in war. The great ships of King Henry's fleet serve both purposes.\" He frowns thoughtfully. \"But there are trade-offs. A ship built purely for war is faster, more maneuverable. A ship built purely for trade carries more cargo. The dual-purpose vessel does both, but excels at neither.\"\n\n\nDon Íñigo López de Mendoza adds: \"The Aragonese and Catalans have long experience in Mediterranean naval matters. King Alfonso maintains both galleys and round ships. Perhaps his admirals could advise...\"\n\n\nDiego de Daza interjects with the financial perspective: \"Each carrack cost approximately fourteen thousand florins to build, Your Majesty. They require crews of perhaps fifty to eighty men for sailing. In wartime, they would need additional soldiers—marines, gunners. The ongoing costs are substantial.\"\n\n\nÁlvaro raises a hand. \"Perhaps we should hear what Your Majesty envisions. A fleet for what purpose? Trade with where? War against whom? The answers shape what vessels we need.\"",

Transporting 15,000 men from Iberia to Constantinople in one trip\n2. Performing trade operations\n3. Being able to face the Ottoman navy in battle\n\nThis is a massive undertaking. Let me think about what this would require in terms of medieval naval logistics.\n\nA carrack in this period could carry perhaps 200-300 men in crowded conditions for a military transport. For 15,000 men, you'd need roughly 50-75 large transport ships.\n\nBut the user also wants:\n- Trade capability\n- Combat capability against the Ottoman navy\n\nThe Ottoman navy in 1434 consists primarily of galleys - oared warships that are highly maneuverable in the Mediterranean. They're fast, can operate in calms, and are deadly in close quarters.\n\nRound ships (like carracks) are:\n- Better for long voyages\n- Can carry more cargo/men\n- More seaworthy in rough weather\n- Slower and less maneuverable\n- Dependent on wind\n- Higher \"castle\" structures make them good defensive platforms\n\nGalleys are:\n- Fast and maneuverable\n- Can operate without wind\n- Lower freeboard makes them vulnerable in rough seas\n- Less cargo capacity\n- Require large crews (rowers)\n- Expensive to maintain\n- Better for Mediterranean combat\n\nA mixed fleet makes sense:\n- Carracks for transport and as floating fortresses in battle\n- Galleys for combat, scouting, towing becalmed ships\n- Perhaps some smaller vessels for communication/scouting\n\nLet me think about the council's response. They should:\n1. React to the scale of this ambition\n2. Discuss the different ship types\n3. Consider where to build them\n4. Consider crew requirements\n5. Consider costs\n6. Consider the time to build such a fleet\n\nThis is a major strategic discussion. The council members should contribute their expertise while acknowledging the limits of their knowledge on naval matters.\n\n\nThe council falls silent. The scale of what Juan proposes is staggering.\n\n\nÁlvaro de Luna is the first to recover. \"Fifteen thousand men in one voyage. Your Majesty, that is... an enormous undertaking. The largest fleet Castile has ever assembled.\"\n\n\nHe turns to the others, inviting their input.\n\n\n\nSir Thomas Beaumont speaks from his English experience:\n\n\n\"When King Henry invaded France, he required over a thousand ships to transport his army—though many were small vessels, fishing boats pressed into service.\" He shakes his head. \"But the English Channel is narrow. Iberia to Constantinople is... weeks at sea. You need proper ocean-going vessels, not coastal craft.\"\n\n\nHe begins calculating aloud: \"A large carrack can carry perhaps two hundred fifty to three hundred men in military transport conditions—crowded, uncomfortable, but feasible. For fifteen thousand men, you would need fifty to sixty carracks of good size.\"\n\n\nHe pauses. \"Plus horses. If you are transporting knights, you need horse transports. A carrack might carry thirty to forty horses, no more. Heavy cavalry requires many additional vessels.\"\n\n\n\nDon Íñigo López de Mendoza raises another consideration:\n\n\n\"The voyage itself is perilous. From Cádiz or Málaga to Constantinople—through the Strait of Gibraltar, along the Barbary coast, past Sicily, through waters controlled by Genoa, Venice, and the Ottomans themselves.\" He frowns. \"Such a fleet would need escorts. Warships to protect the transports.\"\n\n\n\nDiego de Daza has been scribbling calculations:\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, if we assume sixty carracks at fourteen thousand florins each... that alone is eight hundred forty thousand florins. More than the entire treasury.\"\n\n\nHe looks up, slightly pale.\n\n\n\"And that is only the transports. Before escorts, before crews, before supplies.\"\n\n\n\nÁlvaro steers the conversation back to practicalities:\n\n\n\"Your Majesty asked about a mixed fleet. This is wise. Different vessels serve different purposes.\"\n\n\nHe counts on his fingers:\n\n\n\"Carracks—large, sturdy, can carry men and cargo. They mount guns and have high castles that make them difficult to board. In battle, they serve as floating fortresses. But they are slow, dependent on wind, and vulnerable to galleys in calm waters.\"\n\n\n\"Galleys—the weapon of Mediterranean war. Fast, maneuverable, independent of wind. The Ottomans use them extensively. But they cannot make the Atlantic voyage safely, they require enormous crews of rowers, and they carry little cargo.\"\n\n\n\"Galleasses—a compromise. Larger than galleys, they combine oars and sails. Venice uses them. They can fight and carry modest cargo. But they are expensive and complex.\"\n\n\nHe spreads his hands.\n\n\n\"A fleet to do what Your Majesty describes would need all three types, I think. Carracks for transport and heavy combat. Galleys for battle and protecting the carracks in calm waters. Perhaps smaller vessels—caravels, pinnaces—for scouting and communication.\"\n\n\n\nCaptain Fernán adds a soldier's perspective:\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, I have seen the Ottoman galleys from the deck of our carracks. They are fast—terrifyingly fast. If they catch a carrack becalmed, they swarm it like wolves on a wounded stag.\" He pauses. \"But if the wind is with you, a carrack's guns can shatter a galley before it closes. The question is always the wind.\"\n\n\n\nThe council looks to Juan, awaiting direction. The questions hang in the air:\n\n\nHow many ships of each type? Built where? Crewed by whom? At what cost?

Asking about workshops in Castile - particularly iron production and potential for tool/weapon manufacturing\n\nLet me address each of these in turn through the council's responses.\n\nFirst, the naval matter - Juan wisely recognizes he needs an expert. The council should discuss where to find such a person.\n\nSecond, the infrastructure investment is more modest and manageable - 40,000 florins per year is reasonable.\n\nThird, the workshops question - this is about Castilian industrial capacity. Historically, the Basque country was known for iron production. Spain did have significant iron works. The council should be able to discuss this.\n\nLet me have Diego respond to the allocation, and then have the council discuss both the admiral question and the workshop question.\n\n\nDiego de Daza nods, making careful notations in his ledger.\n\n\n\"Two hundred thousand florins reserved for naval expansion, to be spent under the direction of a competent admiral. Forty thousand florins annually for infrastructure improvements over five years.\" He calculates quickly. \"That is four hundred thousand florins committed over the period—substantial, but the treasury can bear it, particularly with the surplus we are generating.\"\n\n\nHe notes the figures and looks up.\n\n\n\nOn the Matter of an Admiral\n\n\nÁlvaro de Luna strokes his chin thoughtfully. \"Your Majesty is wise to seek expertise before spending. A fleet built by landsmen is a fleet built poorly.\"\n\n\nHe considers the options:\n\n\n\"Castile has capable ship captains—men who know the Atlantic trade, the fishing grounds, the route to Flanders. But a true admiral? One who understands fleet tactics, shipyard management, naval architecture?\" He shakes his head slowly. \"We have not fought a major naval war in living memory. Our expertise lies on land.\"\n\n\nDon Íñigo offers: \"The Aragonese have such men. King Alfonso's admirals have fought in the Mediterranean for generations. Perhaps he could lend us an expert, or recommend a man willing to enter Castilian service.\"\n\n\nSir Thomas Beaumont adds: \"The Genoese are the finest shipbuilders in Christendom. Their admirals command fleets across the known world. A Genoese captain seeking new employment might bring both expertise and connections to shipwrights.\"\n\n\nÁlvaro nods slowly. \"There are also the Portuguese. Prince Henry—they call him the Navigator—has been building ships and training captains at Sagres for years. They explore the African coast, develop new vessel designs. A Portuguese naval man would know modern techniques.\"\n\n\nHe turns to Juan. \"Shall I make inquiries, Your Majesty? Discreetly, to determine who might be available and suitable?\"\n\n\n\nOn the Matter of Workshops\n\n\nDiego de Daza brightens at this question—it touches on economic development, his passion.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty is correct that Castile produces abundant iron. The Basque country—Vizcaya, Guipúzcoa—has mines and foundries that have operated for centuries. Bilbao exports iron ingots across Europe.\"\n\n\nHe pulls out another ledger, one covering economic surveys.\n\n\n\"But Your Majesty identifies a weakness. We export raw iron and import finished goods—tools, weapons, armor, nails, fittings. The profit in transformation goes to foreign smiths.\"\n\n\nHe warms to the subject:\n\n\n\"Toledo already has a reputation for fine swordsmithing—the espadas toledanas are prized throughout Christendom. But this is artisan work, small workshops producing luxury goods. What Your Majesty describes is different—large workshops producing tools and weapons in quantity.\"\n\n\nDon Íñigo interjects: \"The Military Orders maintain their own armories. Calatrava especially has skilled smiths who produce weapons and armor for the knights. Perhaps their methods could be expanded.\"\n\n\nDiego nods eagerly. \"If we established royal workshops—manufacturas reales—near the iron sources in the north, we could produce standardized tools, weapons, ship fittings, nails by the thousands. The iron travels a short distance to the workshop; the finished goods travel to markets across the kingdom and beyond.\"\n\n\nHe hesitates. \"But this requires expertise we do not fully possess. Master smiths who understand large-scale production. Investment in water-powered hammers, proper forges, storage facilities. Perhaps...\"\n\n\nHe glances at Sir Thomas.\n\n\n\"Perhaps we could recruit master craftsmen from abroad? Flanders, Germany, Milan—these places have developed such industries. A few skilled masters could train Castilian apprentices.\"\n\n\nÁlvaro summarizes: \"So we need an admiral for the fleet, and master smiths for the workshops.

This is a great opportunity to explore what medieval Castile could produce and develop. Let me think about what industries and resources Castile had or could develop in the 1430s.\n\nHistorical resources and industries in Castile:\n1. Wool - Castile was famous for merino sheep and wool export\n2. Iron - Basque country had significant iron production\n3. Wine - Various regions produced wine\n4. Olive oil - Southern regions\n5. Leather - Córdoba was famous for leather working\n6. Textiles - Some cloth production, but much was imported\n7. Salt - Crown monopoly\n8. Silver/gold - Some mining\n9. Shipbuilding - Basque shipyards\n10. Ceramics - Various regions\n11. Glass - Limited production\n12. Paper - Could be developed\n13. Silk - Granada had silk production from the Moors\n\nThe council should discuss these opportunities. Diego would be especially interested in this as it relates to economic development.\n\n\nThe council stirs with interest. This is a question that touches on the future prosperity of the kingdom.\n\n\nDiego de Daza practically glows—this is precisely the kind of strategic thinking he lives for.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty asks the right question. A kingdom that exports raw materials and imports finished goods will always be poorer than one that transforms its own resources.\"\n\n\nHe begins listing opportunities, ticking them off on his fingers:\n\n\n\nWool and Textiles\n\n\n\"This is our greatest untapped opportunity, Your Majesty. Castilian merino wool is the finest in Europe—Flemish and Italian weavers pay premium prices for it. But we sell them the wool, and they sell us back the cloth at three times the price.\"\n\n\nHe shakes his head in frustration.\n\n\n\"We have attempted textile workshops before, but they produce coarse cloth that cannot compete with Flemish quality. The expertise lies in Flanders, in Florence, in the Italian cities. If we could recruit master weavers—as Your Majesty suggests for the smiths—we could produce fine cloth ourselves.\"\n\n\nDon Íñigo adds: \"Segovia already has some textile production. The infrastructure exists; it is the skill that is lacking.\"\n\n\nDiego nods. \"A royal textile manufactory in Segovia, staffed with Flemish masters training Castilian apprentices... within a decade, we could be producing cloth for domestic consumption. Within two decades, perhaps for export.\"\n\n\n\nLeather\n\n\n\"Córdoba,\" Diego says simply. \"The cordobanes and guadamecíes—Córdoban leather—are already famous throughout Europe. This industry exists and thrives. The Moorish craftsmen who remained after the conquest generations ago passed their techniques to Christian workers.\"\n\n\nHe pauses. \"What we lack is scale. The workshops are small, family operations. Royal investment could expand production—more tanneries, more craftsmen, standardized quality. Leather for saddles, armor, boots, bookbinding... the market is vast.\"\n\n\n\nSilk\n\n\nArchbishop Cerezuela speaks up unexpectedly: \"Granada.\"\n\n\nThe council turns to him.\n\n\n\"The Moors cultivated silk in Granada for centuries. Mulberry groves, silkworm farms, weaving workshops. When Your Majesty conquered the emirate, you inherited this industry.\" He folds his hands. \"I am told production has... declined since the conquest. The skilled workers fled, or were displaced, or simply stopped working under new masters they did not trust.\"\n\n\nDiego grimaces. \"The Archbishop speaks truly. Granada's silk production has fallen by half or more. But the mulberry trees still stand. The knowledge still exists among some who remained. With proper encouragement—protection for the craftsmen, guaranteed purchases, perhaps tax relief—the industry could recover.\"\n\n\n\nSalt and Salted Fish\n\n\n\"The crown already holds the salt monopoly,\" Diego notes. \"But we could do more with it. The Atlantic fisheries—cod, sardines—are enormous. Portuguese and Basque fishermen already work these waters. Salted fish feeds armies and navies; it travels without spoiling.\"\n\n\nCaptain Fernán nods. \"On campaign, salted fish is worth its weight in silver. A reliable supply would strengthen any military expedition.\"\n\n\nDiego continues: \"Royal investment in salting facilities along the Atlantic coast—Galicia, Asturias—could create a new export industry. The English and Flemish buy salted fish in great quantities.\"\n\n\n\nPaper\n\n\n\"A smaller opportunity, but significant,\" Diego says. \"Paper is increasingly important—for records, books, correspondence. We import most of it from Italy. But paper mills require only water power, rags for pulp, and knowledge of the process.\"\n\n\nHe glances at Sir Thomas. \"I understand there are mills in France and Germany now. The technique spreads. A royal paper mill could supply the chancery, the universities, the Church—and reduce our dependence on imports.\"\n\n\n\nCeramics and Glass\n\n\n\"Talavera already produces fine ceramics,\" Diego notes. \"The industry could be expanded. Glass is more difficult—Venetian glassmakers guard their secrets jealously, and Venice forbids them from leaving on pain of death.\"\n\n\nHe shrugs. \"Still, secrets escape. A skilled glassmaker willing to risk Venice's wrath could establish an industry here.\"\n\n\n\nShipbuilding\n\n\n\"This connects to Your Majesty's naval ambitions,\" Diego says. \"The Basque shipyards already build fine vessels. But they work on traditional designs. If we recruit foreign experts—Genoese, Portuguese, perhaps Venetian—we could learn new techniques. Better ships, built faster, at lower cost.\"\n\n\nHe pauses meaningfully. \"A kingdom that builds its own fleet is a kingdom that controls its own destiny.\"\n\n\n\nÁlvaro de Luna summarizes:\n\n\n\"So we have opportunities in textiles, leather, silk, salted fish, paper, ceramics, and shipbuilding. All require some combination of capital investment, foreign expertise, and patient development.\"\n\n\nHe looks at Juan.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty cannot pursue all of these at once. Which industries does the crown wish to prioritize? And shall we establish a formal program—perhaps a Junta de Manufacturas—to oversee these investments?\"",

Royal Household: 22,500 florins\n2. Military (Regular): 19,800 florins (reduced from Granada garrison)\n3. Administration: 18,630 florins\n4. Diplomatic: 6,500 florins\n5.

One-time: Naples Campaign (42,000) + Royal Fleet Journey (4,000) = 46,000 florins\n\nNew additions from this conversation:\n- Reserved for naval investment: 200,000 florins\n- Infrastructure improvements: 40,000 florins per year for 5 years (so 40,000 for 1434)\n- Junta de Manufacturas (leather, salt, silk): 6,000 florins\n- Military Orders donation: 5,000 x 3 = 15,000 florins\n\nWait, the user said \"5000 each to the military orders\" - there are 3 orders (Santiago, Calatrava, Alcántara), so that's 15,000 florins total.\n\nLet me create the Excel file with all sheets.\n\n\nView: Reading the xlsx skill file for best practices\n\n\nThought process: Architected comprehensive 1434 Castilian budget reconciling revenues, expenses, and reserved commitments.\n\nNow let me create the comprehensive Excel file for Castile's 1434 finances.

The user said to \"put aside\" 200,000 florins. This is a reserve, not necessarily spent in 1434. \n\nI carefully review the original instructions, noting the specific language used. The 200,000 florins is a reserved fund, not an active expenditure for this year. The infrastructure allocation is 40,000 florins annually for five years, with the first year's commitment being made now. I'll adjust the financial calculations to reflect these nuanced instructions precisely.\n\nI'll develop a consolidated financial document that integrates multiple fiscal perspectives, creating a comprehensive overview that captures both current expenses and long-term financial commitments. The goal is a clear, structured financial record that tracks immediate spending and future allocations with precision.\n\nThe document will synthesize treasury details, revenue streams, expenses, and reserved funds into a unified financial framework that provides transparent insight into the fiscal strategy.\n\n\nBash Tool: Creating comprehensive 1434 Castile finances Excel file\n\n\nThought process: Orchestrated spreadsheet creation and financial reconciliation procedures.\n\nGood, the Excel file is created.

Now let me provide a summary for Diego to present to the council.\n\n\n\nDiego de Daza finishes his final calculations and presents the completed ledger to the council.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, the accounts for 1434 are complete.\"\n\n\n\nCASTILE 1434 — TREASURY SUMMARY\n\nAmount (Florins)\nOpening Treasury (Jan 1, 1434)\n371,823\n\nTotal Revenue\n371,594\n\nExpenses:\nAnnual/Recurring\n90,430\nOne-Time (Naples, Journey)\n46,000\nNew Commitments (Infrastructure, Junta, Military Orders)\n61,000\nTotal Expenses\n197,430\n\nNet Surplus\n174,164\n\nTreasury Year-End 1434\n545,987\n\nLess: Naval Investment Reserve\n(200,000)\nAvailable Treasury\n345,987\n\n\nDiego looks up from the ledger.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, even after setting aside two hundred thousand florins for the naval expansion—money that remains in the treasury but committed to a specific purpose—we retain nearly three hundred fifty thousand florins in available funds. The kingdom has never been wealthier.\"\n\n\nÁlvaro de Luna nods slowly. \"The reduction of the Granada garrison alone saves twenty-five thousand florins annually. The reforms pay for themselves many times over.\"\n\n\nDiego adds: \"I have prepared the full accounts in five sections: Treasury Summary, Revenue Details, Expense Details, Reserved Funds, and Year-End Summary. All categories are documented.\"\n\n\nHe pauses. \"I recommend Your Majesty save this to your records alongside the 1433 accounts. The file is ready.\"\n\n\n\nThe Excel file contains all income and expenses for 1434, formatted consistently with your previous financial records. Save it to your Spain 1430 folder to maintain continuity.\n\nFile: /mnt/user-data/outputs/Castile_1434_Finances.xlsx",
