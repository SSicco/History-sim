      "text": "**From Chapter 2.39:**\n- **Date/Time**: Late November 1435, Daytime\n- **Location**: Toledo (Alcázar), following financial review\n- **Present**: Diego de Daza (just concluded presentation)\n- **Situation**: Financial review complete; year-end accounts finalized\n- **Condition**: Juan healthy; kingdom stable\n\nThe chapter ended right after Diego de Daza concluded the 1435 financial presentation. I should pick up exactly where we left off - in the Alcázar of Toledo, with Diego de Daza having just finished presenting the year-end accounts.\n\nLet me write the chapter introduction.\n\nChapter 2.40\n\nLate November 1435, Afternoon\n\nThe last of the parchment scrolls lies rolled before you on the council table. Diego de Daza has just finished his presentation of the 1435 accounts—a year of deliberate investment that has drawn the treasury down to just over half a million florins, but with projections showing recovery by 1436 and growth accelerating thereafter. The administrator stands quietly, hands folded, awaiting any final questions or dismissal.\n\nThrough the high windows of the Alcázar, the late autumn light falls at a slant across the chamber. Toledo in November carries a certain stillness—the harvest gathered, the roads quieting before winter, the business of the realm settling into the slower rhythms of the dark months. Alfonso's triumph in Naples, the consolidation of Constantinople, the African ventures with Prince Henry—these ventures no longer demand your constant attention. For the first time in years, the kingdom rests in something approaching peace.\n\nPresent are Diego de Daza and two of his clerks who assisted with the financial presentation.",

      "text": "Wait, the chapter summary says \"Queen Lucia and all children healthy\" at the end, but I don't see explicit mention of the birth in Chapter 2.39. Let me re-read...\n\nThe Chapter 2.39 summary mentions:\n- Princess Catalina, Prince Fernando, and other children playing\n- \"Queen Lucia and all children healthy\" in the notes\n\nBut it doesn't explicitly mention a new baby being born. However, since we're in late November 1435 and the baby was due September 1435, we should assume the birth happened (successfully, given the note about everyone being healthy).\n\nThe user is now asking about trying for another child AFTER Lucia has given birth. This is a conception roll.\n\nI need to use the chaos roll skill for this, as it's about determining an uncertain outcome. Let me read the skill.\n\nActually, I should also clarify - the user is asking about conception, not childbirth. This is about whether Lucia conceives another child after her most recent pregnancy (the one due September 1435).\n\nLet me think about the relevant factors:\n\n**Factors affecting conception:**\n1. Lucia's age - she's about 25-26, which is good for fertility\n2. Her recent pregnancy history - she's had 2 successful pregnancies (Bianca and the September 1435 child)\n3. General health - described as excellent\n4. Timing - they're trying for a child, presumably during the fertile window\n5. Historical context - noble couples who wanted children and had regular relations typically conceived within a year or so\n\nLet me research historical conception rates for 15th century nobility to ground this properly.\n\nActually, I should first confirm what happened with the September 1435 pregnancy. The chapter summary says \"Queen Lucia and all children healthy\" which implies the birth went well, but it's not explicitly stated. I'll assume the birth happened successfully since we're in late November 1435.\n\nFor conception rates, I should consider:\n- Lucia is young and healthy\n- She's proven fertile (multiple successful conceptions)\n- They are actively trying\n- Medieval noble couples who wanted children and had no fertility issues typically conceived within 6-12 months\n\nLet me search for historical data on conception rates.\n\nWeb Search: medieval nobility conception rate fertility 15th century how often pregnant\n\nSocial Perception of Infertility and Its Treatment in Late Medieval Italy: Margherita Datini, an Italian Merchant’s Wife - PMC nih.gov\n\nPregnancy and Childbirth in Twelfth-and Thirteenth-Century French and English Law on JSTOR jstor.org\n\nMedieval Fertility and Pregnancy Tests | The Recipes Project hypotheses.org\n\nFertility and Birth Rates in the Medieval World brewminate.com\n\nChildbirth in Medieval and Tudor Times by Sarah Bryson - The Tudor Society tudorsociety.com\n\nGetting Pregnant in Medieval Europe | Medium medium.com\n\nMedieval Fertility Rates – Kyra Cornelius Kramer kyrackramer.com\n\nInfertility in the Middle Ages - Medievalists.net medievalists.net\n\nHow Large were Medieval Peasant Families? - Medievalists.net medievalists.net\n\nThe medieval biological clock? Gendered reproductive aging in medieval western medicine - ScienceDirect sciencedirect.com\n\nGood research. The key findings for constructing this table:\n\n1. For medieval noble women who were healthy and fertile (like Lucia who has already conceived multiple times):\n- Breastfeeding delayed conception, often creating 2-3 year gaps between children\n- Medieval physicians believed men and women were \"broadly fertile up to a final cut-off point\"\n- \"50% chance of going to term\" for each pregnancy (though this may be high or apply to general population, not nobility with good care)\n- Wealthy families had more children due to better nutrition and care\n- Noble households could have up to 5 surviving children\n- Rural women (better nutrition) had fertility into their 30s\n- Lucia is ~26, in her prime fertile years\n\n2. Factors specific to Lucia:\n- Age: ~26 - excellent for fertility\n- Health: Described as excellent throughout\n- Previous fertility: Has conceived at least 2 times (Bianca + September 1435 child), possibly 3+\n- Nutrition: Royal, so excellent\n- Juan's fertility: Proven - has fathered at least 4 children (Catalina, Fernando, Bianca, and the Sept 1435 child)\n\n3. Timing considerations:\n- If the September 1435 child was born and Lucia is breastfeeding, there's natural infertility from lactation\n- However, noble women often used wet nurses, which would allow for quicker conception\n- If Lucia is using a wet nurse, conception could occur within a few months\n\nFor a fertile couple actively trying, with no fertility issues, where the woman is not breastfeeding (or using a wet nurse), the per-cycle conception rate is roughly 15-25% in modern terms, and similar in the medieval period for healthy individuals.\n\nIf we're asking \"do they conceive within, say, the next 6 months,\" the probability is quite high - perhaps 60-80% for a healthy fertile couple actively trying.\n\nLet me build a realistic table that considers:\n\nI'll analyze the conception probabilities by breaking down the likelihood of different outcomes. The table will prioritize the most probable scenarios for a proven fertile couple like Lucia and Juan. I'll focus on the high chance of successful conception, accounting for minor potential complications while recognizing their low probability of occurrence.\n\nThe approach will stratify potential outcomes from most likely to least likely, providing a nuanced view of their reproductive potential during this specific period.\n\nWeb Search: medieval miscarriage rate pregnancy loss first trimester 15th century\n\nReconsidering maternal mortality in medieval England: aristocratic Englishwomen, c. 1236–1503 | Continuity and Change | Cambridge Core cambridge.org\n\nThe Hard Truth About Pregnancy in Medieval Times | by Time Tales | Medium medium.com\n\nChildbirth in Medieval and Tudor Times by Sarah Bryson - The Tudor Society tudorsociety.com\n\nWomen’s Reproductive Dysfunctions: Miscarriage, Abortion, Stillbirth and Infertility in Medieval England | Jeanne de Montbaston wordpress.com\n\nTudor Q and A: Question from Pamela - Stillbirths and miscarriages tudorhistory.org\n\nIn medieval Europe, how were miscarriages typically dealt with? - Quora quora.com\n\nMiscarriage and the Female Body in the Medieval Imagination brewminate.com\n\nFull article: ‘The Child that is Born of One’s Fair Body’ – Maternal and Infant Death in Medieval Ireland tandfonline.com\n\nWomen, Men and Miscarriage in Early Modern England'. ... herts.ac.uk\n\n‘It bringeth them into dangerous perill’: management of and recovery after miscarriage in early modern England, c.1600–1750 | Historical Research | Oxford Academic* oup.com\n\n1. Miscarriage rates: Research suggests \"perhaps as many as 1 in 3 pregnancies do not result in live births\" - this includes very early losses that might not even be recognized as pregnancies\n2. For medieval nobility with good care, maternal mortality in childbirth was about 1-2% per birth\n3. Each pregnancy \"had no better than a 50% chance of going to term\" (though this may be a general statistic including all populations)\n4. Infant mortality: 25-30% before age 5 for nobility, higher for commoners; 19% before age 2 in one medieval English village\n\nFor this conception roll, I need to focus on:\n1. Whether conception occurs at all\n2. If it does, whether the pregnancy is viable (makes it past early pregnancy)\n\nLucia's factors:\n- Age: ~26 - prime fertility years\n- Health: Excellent\n- Previous fertility: Proven (at least 2-3 successful pregnancies to term)\n- Nutrition: Royal/excellent\n- Juan's fertility: Proven (at least 4 children)\n- Wet nurses likely being used (so breastfeeding doesn't delay conception)\n\nFor a healthy, proven-fertile couple in their mid-20s actively trying to conceive:\n- Modern data suggests ~15-25% conception rate per cycle\n- Over 6 months of trying, cumulative probability is ~60-85%\n- Over 12 months, ~90%+\n\nGiven the factors, I should make this heavily weighted toward success. The main risks are:\n1. Early miscarriage (historically common, perhaps 15-25% of recognized pregnancies)\n2. Some small chance of unexplained difficulty\n\nLet me construct the table:\n\n**Conception within a reasonable timeframe (say, by Spring 1436):**\n- Very high chance of conception (Lucia is proven fertile, young, healthy)\n- If conception occurs, ~15-20% chance of early loss\n\n- Minimal likelihood of complete fertility challenges\n\nI'll break down the probability ranges to capture nuanced reproductive outcomes:\n- Narrow window for conception difficulties (1-5)\n- Moderate chance of first-trimester loss (6-20)\n- Strong probability of successful pregnancy progression (21-100)\n\nThis approach reflects historical reproductive realities:\n- Minimal unexplained fertility barriers\n- Realistic early pregnancy loss probability\n- High likelihood of successful conception and pregnancy continuation\n\nBased on the research, I can now construct a historically grounded table. The key factors:\n\nFavorable factors:\n\nLucia is approximately 26—peak fertility years\n\nProven fertile: at least 2-3 successful pregnancies to term\n\nExcellent health throughout all pregnancies\n\nJuan's fertility proven (4+ children)\n\nRoyal nutrition and care\n\nWet nurses available (breastfeeding won't delay conception)\n\nRisk factors:\n\nEarly pregnancy loss was common (~15-25% of recognized pregnancies)\n\nMedieval couples sometimes experienced unexplained delays despite prior fertility\n\nChaos Roll: Conception Attempt\n\nLucia has recovered from her September 1435 delivery. The royal couple attempts to conceive another child through late autumn and winter 1435-1436.\n\nRelevant factors: Lucia age 26 (excellent), proven fertility (both partners), excellent health and nutrition, no known complications, wet nurse employed allowing natural fertility to resume.\n\nd100 Table:\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-3\nUnexplained Difficulty — Despite regular attempts, no conception by Spring 1436. Physicians are consulted; prayers and offerings made. May require further rolls in future.\n4-18\nEarly Loss — Lucia conceives in winter but experiences an early miscarriage (before quickening). She recovers physically within weeks. Emotionally difficult but medically common.\n19-35\nConception by Late Winter — Lucia conceives in February/March 1436. Child expected November/December 1436.\n36-70\nConception by Midwinter — Lucia conceives in January 1436.

Child expected August/September 1436.\n96-100\nVery Swift Conception with Excellent Signs — Lucia conceives almost immediately (late November/early December). Physicians note exceptional vitality.

Toledo grows cold, the court settles into its seasonal rhythms, and the business of the realm—the Portuguese negotiations, the African ventures, the continuing reports from Constantinople—occupies the days. The nights are long, and private.\n\nBy late February, the signs become clear. Lucia's courses cease; the familiar symptoms return. The royal physicians confirm what she already suspects.\n\n\"March, perhaps,\" she tells you one evening, sitting by the fire in your chambers. Her hand rests on her belly—still flat, the child no larger than a walnut. \"The physicians say November or December for the birth. God willing.\"\n\nShe looks at you with that direct gaze of hers, grey-green eyes catching the firelight. \"Four children in three years of marriage, Juan. The House of Trastámara will not want for heirs.\" A slight smile. \"Though I confess I had hoped for a few months' rest before beginning again.\"\n\nOutside, a late winter rain patters against the windows. Spring approaches—and with it, the season when ships sail and armies march and the great game of thrones resumes.\n\nIt is now late February 1436.

Special Talent: 76 — Languages (76-85 range)\n5. Piety: 50 — Sincere (36-60 range)\n6. Physical Presence: 87 — Magnificent (76-90 range)\n\nThis is a fascinating combination. Fernando is:\n- Brilliant intellectually\n- Bold and confident in temperament\n- Reluctant/poor at martial pursuits (this is significant for a medieval prince!)\n- Gifted with languages\n- Sincerely pious (unlike his sister Catalina who is indifferent)\n- Physically magnificent - looks every inch a king\n\nThis creates an interesting character - he LOOKS like a warrior king, has the confidence and intellect for rule, but has no aptitude or interest in arms. He's a scholar-king in a magnificent body. This will create tension - people will expect him to be a great warrior based on his appearance, but he'll disappoint in the lists and on the battlefield. His gifts lie elsewhere - in diplomacy, in languages, in the arts of peace.\n\nThis is actually quite historically interesting - there were medieval kings who were poor warriors but excellent administrators and diplomats. Fernando will need to surround himself with capable military men and rely on his other gifts.\n\nThe contrast with Catalina is also striking:\n- Catalina: Brilliant, commanding, musical, indifferent to faith, beautiful\n- Fernando: Brilliant, bold, reluctant warrior, gifted with languages, sincerely pious, magnificent presence\n\nCatalina may actually be the more \"martial\" of the two in spirit, even though she's a woman. Fernando looks the part of a warrior king but has no aptitude for it.\n\nFERNANDO TRASTÁMARA — PRINCE OF ASTURIAS\n\nIntelligence: 82 — Brilliant\n\nThe boy who grabbed his father's beard upon their reunion grows into a mind of exceptional quality. Fernando learns to read early, devours books, asks questions that surprise his tutors. Languages, history, theology, natural philosophy—he absorbs knowledge like dry earth drinks rain. By the time he is ten, he will be correcting scribes' Latin. By fifteen, he will hold his own in theological debates with bishops. His father's intellectual intensity burns in him, refined and focused.\n\nTemperament: 64 — Bold\n\nThere is nothing timid about Fernando. He speaks his mind, acts decisively, and meets the world with confidence. When other children hesitate, he steps forward. When courtiers equivocate, he states his position clearly. This boldness serves him well in council chambers and diplomatic negotiations—he does not flinch from difficult conversations or hard truths. Men respect his directness even when they disagree with his conclusions.\n\nMartial Aptitude: 9 — Reluctant\n\nAnd here is the shadow on the heir of Castile.\n\nFernando does not take to arms. The sword feels wrong in his hand. The violence of the training yard unsettles him. He learns what he must—a prince cannot be entirely ignorant of warfare—but he will never excel. He finds excuses to leave practice early. His instructors exchange concerned glances. By adolescence, squires younger than him will unhorse him in the lists.\n\nFor a kingdom forged in the Reconquista, for a father who led cavalry charges at Granada, for a dynasty whose legitimacy rests partly on martial prowess—this son, this heir, this Prince of Asturias... prefers books to swords.\n\nIt is not cowardice. Fernando is bold enough to face danger when he must. But he sees no glory in it, feels no thrill at the clash of steel. War, to him, is a failure of statecraft—a thing to be avoided through superior diplomacy, not celebrated through feats of arms.\n\nSpecial Talent: 76 — Languages\n\nWhat Fernando lacks in martial gifts, he possesses in abundance elsewhere. Languages come to him as naturally as breathing. Castilian, Latin, Portuguese, Catalan—by twelve. Italian, French, some Greek—by sixteen. Arabic phrases picked up from converted scholars. He hears a tongue spoken and something in his mind begins working, pulling apart patterns, assembling grammar, building vocabulary.\n\nThis is no mere parlor trick. A king who speaks to ambassadors in their own language, who reads foreign correspondence without translators, who can address subjects across a polyglot empire in words they understand—such a king wields a subtle but profound power.\n\nPiety: 50 — Sincere\n\nUnlike his sister Catalina, whose devotions ring hollow, Fernando believes. Not with the fervent intensity of a mystic or the burning certainty of a crusader—but with genuine, quiet faith. He prays because prayer matters to him. He attends Mass because he seeks God there, not merely because kings must be seen to worship. His faith is a foundation, not a performance.\n\nThis will comfort Juan immensely. Where Catalina's spiritual emptiness wounds him, Fernando's sincere devotion reassures. The heir to Castile believes in the God his father serves.\n\nPhysical Presence: 87 — Magnificent\n\nAnd here is the cruelest irony.\n\nFernando grows tall. Broad-shouldered. Strong-limbed. He has the build of a warrior-king, the physical presence that makes men think \"there stands a ruler.\" When he enters a room, eyes turn. When he sits a throne, he looks right there—as if God designed him to wear a crown.\n\nHe looks like everything a medieval king should be.\n\nExcept he cannot fight.\n\nThe magnificent body houses a scholar's soul. The hands that could grip a war-sword with authority prefer to turn pages. The frame that could anchor a cavalry charge would rather sit in a library. Men will see Fernando and expect El Cid reborn. They will find instead a polyglot philosopher who wins through words what other kings win through blood.\n\nSome will call this weakness. Others, in time, may call it wisdom.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nFernando Trastámara — Prince of Asturias, heir to Castile and León.\n\nA brilliant, bold, magnificently-built scholar-prince who speaks a dozen languages and believes sincerely in God—but who will never win glory in the lists or lead a cavalry charge with his father's fire.\n\nHe looks every inch the warrior-king.\n\nHe is nothing of the sort.\n\nThe contrast with Catalina is striking:\n\nTrait\nCatalina\nFernando\nIntelligence\nBrilliant\nBrilliant\nTemperament\nCommanding\nBold\nSpecial Gift\nMusic (Voice)\nLanguages\nMartial/Physical\nExcellent horsewoman\nReluctant warrior\nPiety\nIndifferent\nSincere\nAppearance\nBeautiful\nMagnificent\n\nThe daughter rides like a cavalry officer and feels nothing for God.

He's a progressive parent who lets his children choose their interests rather than forcing them into rigid gender roles.\n\nThis should be a warm, domestic scene that reveals the children's emerging personalities while also showing Juan and Lucia's relationship and parenting philosophy. I should show the traits we just rolled for Fernando emerging - his brilliance, his boldness, his linguistic aptitude, his disinterest in martial play, his physical magnificence for his age.\n\nI need to stop when there's a natural point for Juan to respond or act, but this seems like more of an observational scene, so I can let it play out with dialogue from Lucia and the children, then stop for Juan's reaction or response.\n\nThe nursery at the Alcázar glows with evening firelight. Outside, February rain patters against the windows, but within, the room is warm, scattered with the detritus of childhood—wooden horses, a cloth doll missing one arm, blocks arranged into what Catalina has declared is Constantinople.\n\nYou sit with Lucia on a cushioned bench near the hearth, her hand resting on her belly where the newest Trastámara—still too small to quicken—grows in secret. The physicians have been sworn to discretion; there will be no announcement until the pregnancy is secure past the dangerous early months.\n\nFernando toddles among the blocks, nearly three years old now, tall for his age and sturdy. He has your chin, Isabel's dark eyes, and a physical presence that draws the gaze. When he moves, there is something certain about him—a solidity that seems to belong to a much older child. Doña Beatriz has remarked, more than once, that he looks like a prince from an illuminated manuscript.\n\n\"Polis,\" he says, pointing at the block-city. Then, switching without pause: \"Ciudad. City.\" He looks up at Catalina for approval.\n\nCatalina, four years old and already imperious, surveys her creation with the air of a master architect reviewing plans. \"It needs walls,\" she declares. \"Constantinople has walls. Papa said so. Muri magni.\"\n\n\"Teichē megala,\" Fernando offers—the Greek, imperfect but recognizable.\n\nLucia's hand finds yours. \"He's been listening to you speak with the Byzantine envoys,\" she murmurs. \"Three languages before his third birthday. Four, if we count the Portuguese he's picking up from the nurses.\"\n\nIn the corner, little Bianca—seventeen months old, wobbling on uncertain legs—crashes into a tower of blocks that Pedro, the son of one of your household knights, had been building. Pedro, seven years old and already conscious of rank, looks mortified but says nothing. Bianca laughs, delighted by destruction.\n\n\"Again!\" she demands. \"Ancora!\"\n\nGonzalito, Pedro's younger brother, begins rebuilding the tower with the patient resignation of a child who has learned that princesses get what princesses want.\n\nCatalina has found a wooden sword—left behind by one of the boys—and is swinging it experimentally. The movement is natural, her grip instinctively correct. She lunges at an imaginary enemy, her dark hair flying.\n\n\"Catalina,\" Lucia says mildly, \"that's not—\"\n\nYou touch her arm, and she falls silent. You have discussed this. Catalina will try what Catalina wishes to try.\n\nFernando watches his sister with the sword. One of the older boys—Gonzalito—offers him a smaller wooden blade. \"Your Highness? Do you want to practice?\"\n\nFernando considers the sword with those dark, thoughtful eyes. He takes it, holds it awkwardly, gives it one experimental swing. Then, very deliberately, he sets it down and returns to the blocks.\n\n\"I'm building,\" he says. \"Aedifico.\"\n\nGonzalito looks uncertain. Boys are supposed to want swords. Princes especially. But Fernando is already absorbed in adding a tower to Catalina's Constantinople, murmuring to himself in a mixture of Castilian and Latin as he works.\n\nCatalina, meanwhile, has graduated from lunging at shadows to demanding that Pedro spar with her. Pedro, caught between the impossibility of striking a princess and the impossibility of refusing one, looks desperately toward the adults.\n\n\"She's going to be a terror,\" Lucia observes quietly, watching your daughter advance on the hapless boy with her wooden blade raised. \"A brilliant, beautiful, faithless terror.\"\n\nHer voice carries no judgment—only observation, and perhaps a touch of rueful admiration.\n\n\"And him?\" She nods toward Fernando, who is now explaining to Bianca—in simple Castilian mixed with Italian, adjusting his words to what his baby sister might understand—why the tower needs to be here and not there. \"A scholar-king in a warrior's body. The nobles will expect him to lead charges. He'll want to lead negotiations.\"\n\nThe fire crackles. Rain drums against the windows. Your children play, each revealing in small ways the adults they will become.\n\nLucia leans her head against your shoulder. \"God has a sense of humor, I think. Giving us exactly what we need—but never quite what we expect.\"",

      "text": "For the military orders meeting, I should present this scene and have the Grand Masters respond. This is a significant policy discussion.\n\nLet me check what we know about the military orders from project knowledge - they were transformed rather than dissolved, and are now focused on Constantinople/crusade efforts.\n\nI should:\n1. Narrate the passage of spring with Juan's domestic focus\n2. Show the Greek tutor being acquired\n3. Present the scene with the military orders\n\nThe military orders in Castile would be:\n- Order of Santiago\n- Order of Calatrava  \n- Order of Alcántara\n\nThese were transformed as part of Juan's earlier reforms to focus on the eastern crusade rather than being dissolved.\n\nI need to check who the Grand Masters are from the character database. Let me recall... I saw the character database earlier. Let me think about who would be present.\n\nFrom what I recall:\n- Rodrigo Manrique - Master of Santiago\n- Luis de Guzmán - Master of Calatrava\n- Gutierre de Sotomayor - Master of Alcántara\n\nThese were mentioned in earlier chapters as having agreed to the transformation of the orders toward Constantinople.\n\nI should present the meeting scene with these masters responding to Juan's instructions about settlement recruitment.\n\nThe weeks become months. Spring comes to Toledo—first in pale crocuses pushing through the palace gardens, then in the softening air that carries the scent of almond blossoms from the orchards beyond the walls.\n\nFor the first time since you took the crown, you do not leave.\n\nMarch - May 1436\n\nYou establish a rhythm unknown in your reign: mornings in the council chamber handling the business of the realm, afternoons with your children. Catalina learns that when Papa is in his study, she may sit quietly in the corner with her books—and that if she is very quiet, she may listen to conversations that are not meant for children's ears. Fernando, not yet three, begins joining these sessions, his dark eyes tracking the movement of documents across your desk, his small voice occasionally offering a word in whatever language you last used.\n\n\"He's memorizing the petitioners' names,\" Álvaro observes one afternoon, watching Fernando mouth silently along as a secretary reads a list of noble houses seeking audience. \"And their arms, I suspect.\"\n\nYou hire Demetrios Chalkokondyles, a Byzantine scholar who fled Constantinople years ago and has been teaching Greek in Florence. The promise of royal patronage and the chance to shape the heirs of the Defensor Romaniae proves sufficient to lure him to Toledo. He arrives in April—a thin, precise man in his forties with ink-stained fingers and the slightly haunted look common to Greek exiles.\n\nWithin a week, your children are learning the alphabet. Within a month, Fernando is constructing simple sentences. Catalina, characteristically, learns faster but cares less—she masters the grammar because she masters everything, but Greek does not move her the way music does.\n\n\"The boy has a gift,\" Chalkokondyles tells you privately. \"True facility. He hears the language as music, feels its patterns. The girl... the girl is brilliant, but she learns Greek as she might learn to embroider. Because she is told she must.\"\n\nLucia's pregnancy progresses. By May, she has quickened—the child moving within her, making its presence known. The court knows now. Prayers are said. Candles lit.\n\nJune 1436 — The Military Orders\n\nThe Grand Masters arrive at Toledo in the second week of June: Rodrigo Manrique of Santiago, stern-faced and iron-haired; Luis de Guzmán of Calatrava, older now, his beard gone fully grey; Gutierre de Sotomayor of Alcántara, the youngest of the three, with the watchful eyes of a man still proving himself.\n\nThey gather in the council chamber—the same room where, three years ago, you presented them with the transformation of their orders from Reconquista relics into instruments of eastern crusade. The transition has not been without friction, but it has held. Their knights serve in Constantinople now. Their purpose has shifted from fighting Moors to defending Christendom's eastern frontier.\n\n\"My lords,\" you begin, once the formalities are complete. \"Our capacity for Constantinople settlement this year stands at eight thousand, nine hundred and twenty souls. Ships, supplies, housing in the restored quarters—all prepared.\"\n\nYou let the number settle.\n\n\"I am lifting the restriction on recruitment. You may seek settlers beyond your own estates. Any Christian family willing to make the journey—peasants, craftsmen, second sons with no inheritance, anyone seeking a new life—your agents may approach them.\"\n\nRodrigo Manrique shifts in his seat. \"Your Majesty is aware this will cause... friction with the nobility. Lords do not appreciate other lords' men recruiting their peasants.\"\n\n\"I am aware. I am also aware that Constantinople needs people more than Castilian lords need their full complement of field hands.\" You pause. \"The Dominicans have been preaching throughout the realm—raising families in the Christian faith, the sacred duty of procreation, the virtue of building Christian communities in reclaimed lands. Coordinate with them. Let the preaching prepare the ground; let your recruiters harvest what grows.\"\n\nLuis de Guzmán strokes his grey beard. \"The Dominicans preach well. But preaching alone does not fill ships. What incentives do we offer?\"\n\n\"Land,\" you say simply. \"A plot in Constantinople or its hinterland, granted in perpetuity. Tax exemption for the first five years. Tools and seed provided. The chance to own what they could never own in Castile.\"\n\nGutierre de Sotomayor leans forward. \"And the Greek population? They have accepted Latin settlers, but eight thousand more in a single year...\"\n\n\"The Twelve Apostles—the Greek representatives—have been consulted through Governor Gonzalo de Córdoba. The integration continues. Greeks and Latins work side by side on the walls. Marriages are beginning to occur. The Patriarch himself has blessed the arrangement.\" You spread your hands. \"It is not without tension. But it is working.\"\n\nThe three masters exchange glances—that silent communication of men who have worked together for years.\n\nRodrigo Manrique speaks for them. \"Your Majesty's will is clear. We will coordinate with the Dominicans. We will send recruiters throughout the realm—carefully, with respect for local lords where possible, but with the understanding that Constantinople's need takes precedence.\"\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\"There is one matter, however.\"",

      "text": "1. They've been transformed from Reconquista-focused orders to eastern crusade instruments\n2. They're being asked to recruit settlers - not their traditional military role\n3. The Granada conquest was completed in 1432/1433 - so they no longer have their traditional enemy\n4. They have estates and resources, but their purpose has shifted\n5. They might have concerns about:\n   - Their own manpower for Constantinople garrison duties\n   - Compensation/funding for the recruitment effort\n   - Their role going forward\n   - The balance between military duties and civilian recruitment\n   - Perhaps tensions within the orders about their new direction\n   - Knights who joined to fight Moors, not administer settlements\n\nWhat would be a realistic concern that creates interesting narrative tension but isn't artificially dramatic?\n\nPerhaps:\n- The orders are stretched thin - they have knights in Constantinople, knights in Castile, and now they're being asked to do recruitment work\n- There might be grumbling among younger knights who wanted glory in battle, not administrative work\n- The orders might want something in return - perhaps formal recognition of their new role, or resources\n- There could be practical concerns about the recruitment process itself\n\nI think a good concern would be something practical but also touching on the identity crisis of the orders. They were warrior monks who fought Moors. Now they're... what exactly? Settlement recruiters? Eastern garrison troops? They need clarity about their purpose and perhaps resources to fulfill this new mission.\n\nLet me have Rodrigo Manrique raise a concern that's substantive but not obstructionist - he's been cooperative with Juan, but he has legitimate issues to raise. Perhaps:\n\n1. The orders need more resources/funding to undertake this recruitment\n2. There's discontent among some knights about the new direction\n\n3. They want clarity about their long-term role\n4. There's a specific practical problem\n\nI'll explore the deeper institutional challenges facing the Military Orders. They're experiencing a profound transformation, caught between their martial past and an uncertain administrative future. The Grand Master will likely articulate concerns that balance practical needs with existential questions about institutional identity and purpose.\n\nRodrigo might emphasize the need for clear directives from the crown - defining their evolving role, providing necessary resources, and addressing the potential disconnect between traditional knight culture and these new administrative responsibilities. The conversation will reveal the complex negotiations happening as medieval institutions adapt to changing political landscapes.\n\nRodrigo Manrique shifts slightly, choosing his words with the care of a man who has learned that kings appreciate directness but not presumption.\n\n\"The recruitment will require resources. Agents traveling the realm, lodging, the cost of explaining the opportunity to villagers who have never seen a map—these things require coin.\" He holds up a hand before you can respond. \"The orders can bear some of this burden. We are not mendicants. But if Your Majesty wishes us to recruit aggressively, to truly scour the realm for willing settlers, we will need funding beyond our ordinary means.\"\n\nLuis de Guzmán nods slowly. \"There is also the matter of... presentation. A knight of Calatrava appearing in a village to recruit peasants is one thing. A knight appearing with royal authority—a sealed writ, perhaps—is another. Lords who might obstruct us will think twice if we carry the King's word.\"\n\n\"Both reasonable,\" you acknowledge. \"What sum do you estimate? And I will have the chancellery prepare writs of royal commission.\"\n\nThe three masters confer briefly in low voices. Manrique turns back.\n\n\"Ten thousand florins, divided among the three orders, should suffice for a vigorous campaign through the summer and autumn. If we are to fill those ships by sailing season.\"\n\nHe pauses again. The other matter, clearly, is more delicate.\n\n\"There is something else, Your Majesty. Word from our knights in Constantinople.\"\n\nGutierre de Sotomayor takes over—perhaps because his Alcántara knights form a significant portion of the garrison, or perhaps because Manrique wishes to let the younger man deliver news that might prove unwelcome.\n\n\"Our brothers write that the Ottoman truce holds. The Sultan's forces make no move against the city. Trade flows. The walls rise.\" He hesitates. \"But they also write that there is... restlessness. Among our knights. Among some of the other Latin soldiers.\"\n\n\"Restlessness,\" you repeat.\n\n\"They came east to fight, Your Majesty. To crusade. Instead they patrol walls, drill formations, and watch Ottoman merchants pass peacefully through the straits.\" Sotomayor meets your eyes. \"They do not question your wisdom in securing the truce. But young men with swords and no enemy grow... difficult. There has been talk. Nothing treasonous,\" he adds quickly. \"But talk nonetheless. Some wonder when the real war begins. Others wonder if it ever will.\"",

Jousting, melee, individual combat with blunted weapons. Competitions for the foot soldiers as well—archery, pike drill, formation exercises. Prizes for the victors. Let them compete against each other, against the Venetian and Genoese garrisons, against any Greeks who wish to participate.\"\n\nLuis de Guzmán nods slowly. \"Shared competition might ease tensions between Latin and Greek as well. Nothing builds respect like watching a man handle a lance.\"\n\n\"Large formation drills,\" you continue. \"Not mere garrison exercises—full military maneuvers. Let them practice the campaigns they will one day fight. Amphibious landings. Siege relief. Cavalry coordination with infantry. Make the waiting feel like preparation, not idleness.\"\n\n\"And the Salé raid,\" Gutierre de Sotomayor adds. \"We should ensure the men know of it. That Castile strikes where opportunity presents. That the infidel bleeds even now.\"\n\n\"See that word spreads. The kingdom is not idle. Their king is not idle. When the hour comes, they will have more war than they can stomach.\"\n\nThe masters exchange glances—satisfied, or at least mollified.\n\n\"We will relay Your Majesty's will to Constantinople,\" Manrique says. \"Governor Gonzalo de Córdoba has organized some competitions already, but we will formalize and expand them. Monthly tournaments, perhaps. Quarterly grand exercises.\"\n\nChaos Roll: Impact on Constantinople Garrison Morale\n\nThe Military Orders will implement tournaments, competitions, and large-scale military exercises to channel the restless energy of knights stationed in Constantinople during the Ottoman truce.\n\nFavorable factors:\n\nTournaments provide genuine martial outlet\n\nCompetitions for all ranks (knights, footmen, archers) engage entire garrison\n\nFormation drills give sense of purpose and preparation\n\nRecent Salé raid demonstrates kingdom's continued offensive spirit\n\nPrizes and recognition satisfy desire for glory\n\nCross-cultural competition may build Latin-Greek solidarity\n\nJuan's track record of military success (Granada) lends credibility to \"patience before fury\" message\n\nGovernor Gonzalo de Córdoba is competent administrator\n\nUnfavorable factors:\n\nMany young knights joined after Granada, know only glory, not patience\n\nTournaments are ultimately play—not real combat\n\nOttoman merchants passing peacefully is daily reminder of truce\n\nDistance from home compounds frustration\n\nTalk and grumbling has already begun spreading\n\nSome may view competitions as distraction, not substitute\n\nIndefinite timeline—\"some years\" offers no concrete end point\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-5\nBackfire. Tournaments inflame rather than channel aggression. A serious incident—a death in the lists, a brawl between factions, or worse—worsens morale and creates new problems.\n6-15\nMinimal Effect. The competitions are welcomed but do little to address underlying frustration. Grumbling continues; some knights petition to return home. The issue will resurface.\n16-35\nPartial Success. Morale improves among those who participate, but a significant minority remains dissatisfied. The tournaments buy time but do not resolve the fundamental tension. Continued management required.\n36-65\nSolid Improvement. The competitions channel martial energy effectively. Most knights embrace the tournaments and drills as worthy substitutes. Grumbling fades to acceptable background noise. A few malcontents remain but lack support.\n66-85\nStrong Success. The garrison transforms restlessness into competitive spirit. Latin-Greek relations improve through shared competition. The waiting feels like preparation, not idleness. Morale becomes an asset rather than a concern.\n86-95\nExceptional Success. The tournaments become legendary—drawing participants from Venetian and Genoese enclaves, even Greek nobles. A genuine martial culture emerges around Constantinople. Knights speak of earning glory in the lists until the \"real war\" begins. Unit cohesion strengthens significantly.\n96-100\nBeyond Expectations. The competitions spark something unexpected—a new chivalric order, a Greek-Latin brotherhood of arms, or a tournament tradition that will outlast the generation.

By late summer, word returns through the regular correspondence.\n\nGovernor Gonzalo de Córdoba, ever practical, has seized upon the directive with enthusiasm. The first formal tournament is held in August, in the shadow of the restored Theodosian Walls—a full day of jousting, melee, and individual combat. Knights of Santiago ride against knights of Calatrava; Alcántara faces a mixed team of Venetian and Genoese men-at-arms. A Greek nobleman, one Alexios Philanthropenos, enters the lists and acquits himself well enough to earn grudging respect.\n\nThe foot competitions prove equally popular. Archery draws the largest crowds—Castilian crossbowmen competing against Genoese arbalests, with a few Greek toxotai demonstrating the eastern composite bow. The infantry drills become weekly affairs, with companies competing for recognition and small purses.\n\n\"The men have taken to it,\" Gonzalo de Córdoba writes in his September dispatch. \"The tournaments give them glory to chase. The drills give them purpose. Most have ceased their grumbling—or at least ceased speaking it aloud where officers might hear.\"\n\nMost. Not all.\n\n\"A faction remains,\" the governor continues. \"Perhaps two dozen knights, clustered around a Santiago commander named Hernán de Villena. They participate in the tournaments—Villena himself placed third in the August joust—but they speak openly of the truce as shameful. They call Constantinople a gilded cage. They wish to raid Ottoman territories as Your Majesty raided Salé.\"\n\nGonzalo de Córdoba's assessment is measured: \"They are not numerous, and they lack support among the senior commanders. But they are vocal, and Villena has a certain charisma among the younger men. I do not believe they pose a danger. But I thought Your Majesty should know.\"\n\nThe news reaches Toledo in early October. Lucia is eight months pregnant now, heavy and uncomfortable but healthy. The leaves in the palace gardens have begun to turn.\n\nThe recruitment campaign for Constantinople settlers proceeds well—the Dominicans preach, the military orders recruit, and peasant families across Castile weigh the risks of the familiar against the promise of land and freedom in the east. The final numbers will not be known until the spring sailing, but early reports suggest you will fill those ships.\n\nÁlvaro de Luna reviews Gonzalo de Córdoba's dispatch with you in your study.\n\n\"Hernán de Villena,\" he says, setting down the letter. \"I know the name. Minor nobility from León. Third son, no inheritance to speak of. Joined Santiago young, fought at Granada—distinguished himself in the final assault on the Alhambra, I believe. The kind of man who found himself in war and cannot find himself in peace.\"\n\nHe taps the letter thoughtfully.\n\n\"Two dozen malcontents in a garrison of over a thousand. Gonzalo is right—they pose no immediate danger. But such men can become nuclei for larger troubles if left untended.\"\n\nIt is October 1436. Lucia's child is due within weeks. The Constantinople garrison's morale has stabilized, though a small faction of restless knights bears watching. The settler recruitment campaign is underway.\n\nWhat would you do?",

      "text": "I found good information about Sir Thomas Beaumont and the military academy. The academy was established in a former monastery in Toledo, and Sir Thomas is an English knight who has been running it. He's been training officers and has implemented a system to preserve knowledge. The academy had 47 students back in late 1433.\n\nNow it's October 1436, about 3 years later. The academy should have produced several cohorts of officers by now. Sir Thomas has been implementing the knowledge preservation system, and veterans from Constantinople have been rotating through to teach.\n\nLet me continue the narrative with Juan visiting the academy and asking Sir Thomas about whether their officers can face the Ottomans.\n\nThe Royal War Academy has grown since your last visit. The former monastery on Toledo's eastern slope now sprawls across additional buildings—a new armory, an expanded artillery yard, quarters for the rotating instructors from Constantinople. The clash of steel and the occasional thunderclap of gunpowder exercises echo across the grounds.\n\nSir Thomas Beaumont meets you at the gate, older now—his hair more grey than brown, deep lines carved around his eyes—but still straight-backed and sharp-eyed. Three years of building this institution from nothing have aged him, but also given him purpose.\n\n\"Your Majesty.\" He bows, then falls into step beside you as you walk the grounds. \"I received word you wished to inspect the academy.\"\n\n\"I wished to see what we have built, Thomas. And to ask you a question.\"\n\nThe training yards are full. Where once forty-seven cadets drilled under uncertain instruction, now over a hundred move through exercises with the crisp precision of men who have trained for years. You see the system Sir Thomas proposed in action—veterans from Constantinople, their crosses of Santiago, Calatrava, and Alcántara visible on their surcoats, drilling younger men in formations you recognize from reports of Ottoman warfare.\n\n\"Three graduating classes,\" Sir Thomas explains as you walk. \"The first cohort—thirty-one officers—finished their training in the spring of 1435. Most serve in Constantinople now. The second cohort graduated this past spring. Twenty-eight more. The third is still in training—they will be ready by next summer.\"\n\nHe pauses at the edge of an artillery yard, where cadets practice loading and aiming a small bombard under the supervision of a Genoese gunnery master.\n\n\"Eighty-seven trained officers in three years, Your Majesty. Plus another forty-two currently in training. Not all are equal—some are merely competent, others exceptional. But all of them can read a battlefield, coordinate with other units, and adapt to circumstances their fathers never imagined.\"\n\nYou watch a cavalry drill in the adjacent yard—young knights practicing the feigned retreat, the signature Ottoman tactic that has broken so many Christian armies.\n\n\"The veterans teach what they have learned,\" Sir Thomas continues. \"Every six months, a rotation from Constantinople. They bring fresh knowledge—what the Ottomans are doing, how their tactics evolve, what works and what fails. The cadets learn from men who have seen the enemy, not merely read about them.\"\n\nYou find a quiet corner of the grounds—a small garden that the monks once used for contemplation, now serving the same purpose for a different kind of order. Sir Thomas stands beside you, waiting.\n\n\"Thomas,\" you say. \"You have trained these men. You have studied the Ottomans through the eyes of those who face them. You know our knights, our officers, our capabilities.\"\n\nYou turn to face him directly.\n\n\"If we go to war—not raids, not skirmishes, but war—against the Ottoman Empire... do you think we can win?\"\n\nSir Thomas is silent for a long moment. When he speaks, his voice is measured, careful—the voice of a man who has thought deeply about this question and does not wish to give false comfort.\n\n\"Your Majesty asks a question with many answers, depending on what 'win' means.\"\n\nHe clasps his hands behind his back, staring at the garden wall as if reading maps in the stonework.\n\n\"Can we defeat an Ottoman army in the field? Yes. Under the right circumstances—ground of our choosing, numerical parity or advantage, coordinated command—our heavy cavalry remains the finest in Christendom. The janissaries are fearsome, but they can be broken. I have studied every account I can find. Hunyadi has beaten them. The Albanians under Skanderbeg bloody them regularly in the mountains. They are formidable. They are not invincible.\"\n\nHe turns to face you.\n\n\"But the Ottomans do not fight single battles. They fight campaigns. They can lose an army and raise another. Their Sultan commands resources we cannot match—manpower, gold, territory. If 'winning' means destroying the Ottoman Empire...\" He shakes his head slowly. \"No, Your Majesty. Not with the forces of Castile alone. Perhaps not with all of Christendom united. The serpent is too large to kill in one stroke.\"\n\n\"And if winning means something else?\"\n\nSir Thomas's weathered face creases in thought.\n\n\"If winning means holding Constantinople? Securing the straits? Making the cost of assault so high that the Sultan looks elsewhere for conquest?\" A slow nod. \"That, Your Majesty, is possible. Walls can be held. Chokepoints defended. The Ottomans are not patient with sieges that drag on—they prefer swift conquest. Make Constantinople a fortress that would take years to crack, and they may decide Greece or Hungary offers easier prey.\"\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\"Your officers are ready to fight. The question is whether Christendom is ready to sustain them. Wars are won with gold and grain as much as swords and courage. The Ottomans understand this. I wonder sometimes if we do.\"",

      "text": "I found important information about cannon production. The user is asking about cannon foundries in Seville. From the search results, I found:\n\n1. Master Gunner Pietro Calabrese was a veteran of Granada and commanded artillery for the Naples campaign\n2. During the Granada campaign, they had 5 medium bombards\n3. The Constantinople foundry effort has been struggling - they've produced only 4 cannon with limited success\n\nHowever, I don't have specific details about a cannon foundry in Seville. Let me search more specifically for that, or I may need to acknowledge that we haven't established formal records of the Seville foundry operations and create a reasonable response based on what was implied during the Granada campaign.\n\nLooking at the Book_1 chronicle, it mentions:\n- 5 medium bombards arriving with Master Gunner Pietro Calabrese for the Granada campaign\n- The western campaign proceeded slower than hoped due to lack of wall-breaking artillery\n\nThe user is asking about foundries that were \"started during the reconquista\" which would have been 1431-1432. That's about 4-5 years ago in game time. Let me construct a reasonable response based on what we know, and perhaps this requires some investigation since we don't have formal records.\n\nSir Thomas Beaumont would likely know about the artillery situation since he runs the military academy and would coordinate with artillery training. Let me have him either provide what he knows or suggest the user speak with specific people.\n\nSir Thomas nods at your reassurance, then pauses at your question about the cannon foundries.\n\n\"The artillery program, Your Majesty. That falls somewhat outside my direct purview—my expertise is in training officers for command, not in the casting of bronze.\" He strokes his beard thoughtfully. \"But I have worked with the gunnery instructors here, and I know something of the situation.\"\n\nHe leads you toward the academy's artillery yard, where the Genoese gunnery master—a stocky, soot-marked man named Benedetto—oversees cadets practicing with a small culverin.\n\n\"Master Benedetto,\" Sir Thomas calls. \"His Majesty wishes to know the state of Castile's artillery.\"\n\nBenedetto approaches, bowing hastily and wiping his hands on his leather apron. His Castilian is heavily accented but serviceable.\n\n\"Your Majesty. The foundries, yes. I can tell you what I know—I have visited Seville twice to inspect the work and select pieces for the academy's training.\"\n\nHe gathers his thoughts.\n\n\"The foundry was established during the Granada campaign, yes? Master Gunner Pietro Calabrese oversaw its creation—he recognized that Castile could not rely forever on purchasing Italian and German pieces. The site is near the river, where they can move the heavy bronze and the finished guns by barge.\"\n\nHe holds up fingers as he counts.\n\n\"When the Granada war ended, you had perhaps eight serviceable bombards—the five medium pieces that broke the walls, plus three older guns of varying quality. Since then, the foundry has been producing.\"\n\nHe pauses, calculating.\n\n\"I inspected in the spring of 1435. At that time, they had cast twelve new pieces since the war's end. Eight were field guns—what we call cerbottane or serpentines. Lighter, faster to move, good for breaking formations of men. Four were heavier bombards, though not the great wall-breakers the Ottomans favor.\"\n\nHis expression grows more serious.\n\n\"The quality... improves. The early castings had flaws. Two cracked in testing. One burst—killed a man. But the smiths learn. The pieces cast in 1434 and 1435 are sound. Pietro Calabrese drills his crews well. They can load, aim, and fire faster than any gunners I have seen outside of Italy.\"\n\nHe spreads his hands.\n\n\"If you ask me how many cannon Castile commands today? Perhaps eighteen to twenty serviceable pieces, ranging from light serpentines to medium bombards. Plus whatever has been cast since my last visit—I would estimate another four to six pieces by now. Call it twenty-four guns, Your Majesty. With trained crews for perhaps eighteen of them.\"\n\nSir Thomas interjects: \"The academy trains officers to command artillery, but the gun crews themselves train at Seville under Pietro Calabrese. We coordinate—officers learn the capabilities and limitations of the weapons, so they know how to deploy them. But the men who actually load and fire... those are Calabrese's domain.\"\n\nBenedetto nods agreement. \"The Master Gunner guards his men jealously. He says—and I agree—that a good gun crew is harder to replace than a good cannon. The bronze can be recast. The knowledge in a dead gunner's head cannot.\"\n\nSummary: Castile currently possesses approximately 20-24 cannon of varying sizes, with trained crews for roughly 18 of them. Production continues at the Seville foundry under Master Gunner Pietro Calabrese, with quality steadily improving. The artillery is adequate for field operations and siege support, but not yet at the scale needed for major confrontation with Ottoman gun parks.",

The children grow: Fernando speaks in full sentences now, mixing languages with cheerful abandon; Catalina has begun formal lessons with Chalkokondyles and her music tutors; Bianca toddles after her siblings with the determined frustration of a child who cannot yet keep up.\n\nThe summons to Seville goes out in late March. By mid-April, the foundry delegation arrives in Toledo.\n\nMaster Gunner Pietro Calabrese enters the council chamber with the rolling gait of a man more comfortable on campaign than in palaces. He is older than you remember—the Granada campaign was five years ago now—his dark hair shot through with grey, his hands scarred from decades of working with fire and molten metal. But his eyes remain sharp, assessing, the eyes of a man who has stared down cannon barrels and lived to tell of it.\n\nWith him comes a younger man, introduced as Marcos de Jerez—Calabrese's senior apprentice, now a master founder in his own right. Where Calabrese is weathered and compact, Marcos is tall and lean, with the permanently reddened complexion of a man who works near furnaces.\n\n\"Your Majesty.\" Calabrese's bow is correct but perfunctory—he has never been one for courtly graces. \"You summoned us. We came.\"\n\nHe glances around the chamber, taking in the maps on the walls, the absence of other councilors. You have arranged this as a private audience.\n\n\"You wish to know about the guns,\" he says. It is not a question.\n\n\"Tell me everything,\" you say. \"Production. Quality. Crews. What we have, what we lack, what we need.\"\n\nCalabrese nods to Marcos, who produces a leather satchel and withdraws several documents—inventories, diagrams, notes in a cramped hand.\n\n\"The foundry operates year-round now,\" Calabrese begins. \"When we started during the Granada war, we cast perhaps three pieces a year—and half of those failed. Now?\" He allows himself a thin smile. \"We cast eight to ten pieces annually. Failures are rare. One in eight, perhaps one in ten. The bronze we waste, we recover and recast.\"\n\nMarcos spreads a diagram on the table—a schematic showing different cannon types with measurements and annotations.\n\n\"Current inventory, Your Majesty,\" he says, his voice younger and more eager than his master's. \"As of our departure from Seville:\"\n\nHe runs his finger down a list:\n\n\"Heavy bombards—wall-breakers, siege pieces. Six. Two from the Granada campaign, four cast since. These throw stones of forty to sixty pounds. Slow to move, slow to load, but nothing stands before them.\"\n\n\"Medium bombards—twelve. Versatile pieces. Thirty-pound stones. Can breach lesser fortifications, destroy ships, break formations.\"\n\n\"Serpentines and culverins—fourteen. Field guns. Lighter stones, faster loading. For use against men, not walls.\"\n\n\"Bombardelles—eight. Small pieces. Mounted on carts or walls. Antipersonnel.\"\n\nHe looks up. \"Forty pieces in total, Your Majesty. All serviceable. All tested.\"\n\nCalabrese interjects: \"The numbers are good. But numbers are not everything.\" He taps the diagram. \"The Ottomans—I have heard the reports from Constantinople. They cast guns bigger than anything we have. Bombards that throw stones heavier than a man. We cannot match that. Not yet. Our furnaces are not large enough. Our bronze supply is... adequate, not abundant.\"\n\nHe meets your eyes directly.\n\n\"If you mean to fight the Turks, Your Majesty—truly fight them, not raid corsairs or hold walls—we need to think bigger. Literally. Larger furnaces. More bronze. More men trained in the craft.\" A pause. \"And time. These things cannot be rushed. A cannon cast too quickly is a cannon that kills its own crew.\"",

Each carrack wants six to eight guns—a mix of medium pieces and serpentines. The galleys, one or two pieces each. The older vessels in the fleet, refitting with modern armament.\"\n\nHe sets down the ledger with a thump.\n\n\"We produce eight to ten cannon a year.

The new carracks receive their guns. The galleys receive theirs. But the stockpile—the reserve for campaign or emergency—it does not grow. It shrinks.\"\n\nCalabrese nods grimly. \"Three years ago, after Granada, we had guns sitting in the arsenal waiting for use. Now?\" He shakes his head. \"Every piece we cast is spoken for before the bronze is cool. The Admiral's men are at my door before the gun is even tested, asking when they can load it onto a ship.\"\n\nHe leans forward, his scarred hands flat on the table.\n\n\"You ask how we are supplying the ships, Your Majesty. The truth? We are not. Not adequately. We are falling behind. Every year, the gap between what the navy needs and what we can produce grows wider.\"\n\nHe ticks off points on his fingers:\n\n\"The Princesa Catalina—your royal flagship—she carries her full complement. Eight guns, all quality pieces. The newer carracks, the same. But the older vessels? Some carry half their intended armament. We fill the empty ports with wooden decoys painted to look like cannon, so enemies cannot count our weakness from a distance.\"\n\nMarcos adds quietly: \"The galleys bound for Constantinople this spring—we had to delay arming two of them. They sail with borrowed guns from the harbor defense, which we will replace... when we can.\"\n\nCalabrese sits back, his expression that of a man delivering hard truths.\n\n\"Your Majesty has built a navy. A fine navy—the envy of Iberia. But a navy is not just ships. It is guns, powder, shot, crews trained to use them. The ships multiply faster than we can arm them.\" He pauses. \"If you wish the foundry to keep pace, we need to expand. A second furnace. More bronze—copper from wherever you can find it, tin from wherever you can buy it. More trained men. And—\" he hesitates, \"—perhaps a second foundry entirely. Seville cannot do this alone.\"",

Older ships needing refits. The navy alone requires perhaps thirty cannon annually just to keep pace. We produce ten. The gap is twenty guns a year. Every year.\" He lets that settle. \"In five years, you will have a fleet of beautiful ships carrying wooden decoys instead of bronze.\"\n\nSecond finger. \"Constantinople. You have promised the Greeks cannon. You have sent bronze for their foundries, but their casting is poor—they are learning, not producing. If you mean to defend those walls against Ottoman siege guns, you must send finished pieces, not just ore. How many? I cannot say. But every gun sent east is a gun not arming a Castilian ship.\"\n\nThird finger. \"A field army. If you march against the Turks—truly march, with an army that means to fight battles and break fortifications—you need guns that can move with troops. Serpentines, culverins, light bombards on wheeled carriages. We have some. Not enough for a major campaign. And the crews to man them are stretched thin already.\"\n\nFourth finger. \"The Ottomans themselves. Their guns are bigger. The reports from Constantinople speak of bombards that throw stones of two hundred pounds, three hundred pounds. Pieces so large they must be cast on site because no wagon can carry them.\" He shakes his head slowly. \"We have nothing like that. Our largest pieces throw sixty pounds. If the Sultan brings his great guns against walls we are defending... we cannot answer in kind.\"\n\nHe lowers his hand.\n\n\"So yes, Your Majesty. More production—to arm the navy and build reserves. And bigger guns—to match what the Turks can bring. Both. Not one or the other.\"\n\nMarcos speaks up, more hesitant. \"There is also the matter of powder, Your Majesty. Guns without powder are sculptures. We import saltpeter from Italy, from North Africa when we can get it. The supply is... unreliable.

Possibly a second foundry\n\nLet me estimate costs:\n- A new furnace might cost 3,000-5,000 florins to build\n- Bronze for additional 20 cannons per year: each cannon needs perhaps 500-1,000 pounds of bronze. At roughly 0.5-1 florin per pound, that's 250-1,000 florins per cannon, so 5,000-20,000 florins in bronze per year\n- Additional workers: training and wages, perhaps 1,000-2,000 florins per year\n- A second foundry would be a major investment - perhaps 10,000-15,000 florins to establish\n\nI should have Calabrese think through this practically and give a realistic estimate. He's a practical man who knows his craft.\n\nFor a one-time expansion plus ongoing costs, I think:\n- One-time: 8,000-12,000 florins for infrastructure (second furnace, expanded facilities, tools)\n- Annual ongoing: 15,000-20,000 florins for bronze, workers, and supplies\n\nThis should be presented as Calabrese's practical assessment, not as an exact figure. He's a craftsman, not an accountant, but he knows what things cost.\n\nCalabrese's eyebrows rise slightly—the look of a craftsman who has spent years being asked for the impossible without being asked what it costs. He glances at Marcos, who is already reaching for a blank sheet of parchment and a piece of charcoal.\n\n\"A practical king,\" Calabrese murmurs, almost to himself. \"Good.\"\n\nHe watches as Marcos begins scratching figures, occasionally leaning over to correct or add. The two men confer in low voices—numbers, weights, prices. After several minutes, Calabrese turns back to you.\n\n\"To properly arm the fleet, Your Majesty. Not to catch up overnight—that is impossible—but to close the gap over three years and then maintain pace thereafter.\"\n\nHe takes the parchment from Marcos.\n\n\"First, the foundry itself. We need a second furnace. The one we have can only fire so often before it must cool and be repaired. A second furnace means we can cast continuously—one cooling while the other fires. That is...\"\n\nHe consults the figures. \"Four thousand florins to build. Heavy stonework, the furnace itself, bellows, tools. One-time cost.\"\n\n\"Second, bronze. This is the largest expense. Copper we can source from Castilian mines, but not enough. We must import—from Hungary, from Sweden, from wherever the merchants can find it. Tin is worse—almost all imported. To double production, we need double the metal.\"\n\nHe taps the parchment. \"Bronze for twenty additional cannon per year—roughly fifteen thousand pounds of metal. At current prices... eight thousand florins annually. Perhaps more if demand drives prices up, which it will.\"\n\n\"Third, men. Skilled founders do not grow on trees. We must train them, which takes years, or recruit them from Italy and Germany, which takes gold. To run two furnaces properly, I need twelve more trained men. Recruitment, housing, wages...\"\n\nAnother glance at the figures. \"Two thousand florins the first year—signing bonuses, relocation. Then one thousand florins annually thereafter for the additional wages.\"\n\n\"Fourth, powder and shot. No use making guns we cannot feed. Saltpeter, sulfur, charcoal. Lead and stone for shot. To support a doubled cannon force...\"\n\nMarcos interjects: \"Three thousand florins annually, Your Majesty. Perhaps more if we must compete with Italian buyers for saltpeter.\"\n\nCalabrese sets down the parchment and meets your eyes.\n\n\"In sum, Your Majesty:\n\nOne-time investment: Six thousand florins. The second furnace, initial recruitment, tools and equipment.\n\nAnnual ongoing costs: Fourteen thousand florins. Bronze, powder, shot, wages for additional men.\n\nHe pauses, then adds:\n\n\"That closes the gap in three years and maintains pace thereafter. By 1439, every ship in your fleet carries its full complement. The reserve grows instead of shrinking. And we have capacity to spare—for Constantinople, for a field army, for whatever else you require.\"\n\nMarcos clears his throat. \"There is one more consideration, Your Majesty. If you wish us to expand faster—to arm the fleet in two years instead of three—the costs rise sharply. Bronze prices increase when we buy in larger quantities. Skilled men demand higher wages when we are desperate. Haste costs gold.\"\n\nCalabrese nods. \"Three years is the prudent path. Faster is possible, but expensive. Slower saves money but leaves your ships undergunned longer.\"\n\nHe folds his scarred hands.\n\n\"The choice is yours, Your Majesty. Tell me what you want, and I will make it happen.

      "text": "This is... dark. Very dark. It's also politically complex. Let me think about how Isaac would respond.\n\nIsaac is a spymaster - he deals in shadows and secrets. But he also knows Juan. He knows Juan has insisted on honorable methods before. This request is completely out of character for the Juan who said \"Honesty and honour has been my shield up until now.\"\n\nIsaac would be:\n1. Surprised - this is not the Juan he knows\n2. Cautious - is this a test?\n3. Analytical - even if he's willing, is this wise?\n4. Practical - what are the risks and consequences?\n\nLet me think about the political realities:\n\nAlfonso V of Aragon:\n- Currently rules Aragon, Sicily, and Naples\n- Childless (important - this is why Juan might inherit)\n- Juan's cousin through the Trastámara family\n- Has been a loyal ally throughout the campaign\n- Provided ships, men, support for Constantinople\n- Just secured Naples with Juan's help\n\nIf Alfonso dies:\n- Juan would inherit... but would he? The succession might be contested\n- Aragon has its own nobility who might not want to be absorbed into Castile\n- Sicily and Naples have their own interests\n- The Pope would have opinions\n- France would definitely have opinions (René of Anjou's claims)\n- This would be regicide/kinslaying - the worst crimes in medieval morality\n\nIsaac would likely:\n1. Not refuse outright - he's a spymaster, not a moralist\n2. But he would point out the massive risks\n3. Question whether Juan has truly thought this through\n4. Perhaps probe to understand why Juan is asking this NOW\n5. Consider whether there are alternatives\n\nThe medieval context matters too. Kinslaying is one of the worst sins. Regicide is another. \n\nI recognize Juan's reputation would be utterly destroyed if such a plot were discovered. His carefully constructed image of Christian nobility would collapse instantly. This proposed assassination fundamentally contradicts everything Juan has built - his diplomatic approach, his commitment to honor, his strategic patience in building alliances. Isaac would immediately sense how dramatically this deviates from Juan's established character and principles.\n\nThe spymaster would carefully probe Juan's motivations, seeking to understand what could drive such a radical departure from his previous ethical stance. He would be looking for signs of desperation, external pressure, or some hidden context that might explain this shocking proposal.\n\nThe silence stretches between you. Isaac's face, normally so carefully blank, betrays nothing—but his stillness is absolute. The candle flame wavers; he does not.\n\nWhen he speaks, his voice is very soft.\n\n\"Your Majesty.\"\n\nHe does not move. Does not lean forward or back. Simply... waits, as if tasting the words before responding to them.\n\n\"Before I say anything else, I must ask: is this a test?\"\n\nHe raises a hand before you can answer.\n\n\"I do not ask to insult you. I ask because the man who told me—not two years ago—that 'honesty and honour has been my shield' does not speak of poisoning his cousin and ally in the night. The man who conquered Granada without massacre, who stripped naked before a pope to prove his humility, who insisted that his intelligence network operate by honorable methods...\"\n\nHe tilts his head slightly.\n\n\"That man does not sit in candlelight asking his spymaster how to commit regicide and kinslaying in one stroke.\"\n\nIsaac rises from his chair—slowly, deliberately—and moves to the window. He stares out at the darkened city for a long moment.\n\n\"I am not refusing, Your Majesty. I am your man. If you command this, I will... consider how it might be done.\" He turns back. \"But I am also the man whose purpose is to see dangers you cannot see. So let me show you what I see.\"\n\nHe begins to pace, his voice taking on the measured cadence of a man laying out an argument.\n\n\"First: the soul. You are a man of genuine faith—I have watched you, I know this is not performance. You believe in God, in judgment, in the weight of sin. Kinslaying is among the worst sins in Christendom. The murder of an anointed king is another. Can you carry this? Not 'will you be caught'—can you, Juan of Castile, live with this weight on your soul for the rest of your life and face God with it at the end?\"\n\nHe raises a finger.\n\n\"Second: the secret. Secrets of this magnitude do not stay secret. Mordecai knows poisons. I would know the purpose. Others would be involved—servants, intermediaries, someone to administer the dose. Every person who knows is a thread that can unravel. And if it unravels...\" He shakes his head. \"Everything you have built collapses. Not just your reputation—your alliances. Portugal, the Pope, the Emperor, the Byzantines—all of them allied to a man of honor. Would they remain allied to a man revealed as a poisoner of his own blood?\"\n\nSecond finger.\n\n\"Third: the succession. You say you are Alfonso's heir. Are you certain? Aragon has its own laws, its own Cortes, its own nobility who may prefer a different arrangement. Sicily has Norman traditions. Naples was contested between Anjou and Aragon for decades—do you think René will simply accept that the man who definitely did not poison Alfonso is now rightful king? France will have opinions. The Pope will have opinions. You could spend ten years fighting for an inheritance that Alfonso, living, would simply hand you eventually.\"\n\nThird finger.\n\n\"Fourth: Alfonso himself. He is childless. He is not young. He campaigns hard, eats richly, takes risks on battlefields.\" Isaac spreads his hands. \"Nature may do what you are contemplating, Your Majesty—and without staining your hands. Is the wait truly so unbearable that you would risk everything to shorten it?\"\n\nHe stops pacing and faces you directly.\n\n\"I have killed men. I have arranged for men to die. I do not pretend to be innocent of blood. But I have never seen a king successfully murder his way to a larger crown without that crown eventually choking him.\"\n\nA pause.\n\n\"Tell me why now, Your Majesty. What has changed? What pressure drives you to this? Because I do not believe this comes from nowhere—and if I understand the cause, perhaps I can help you find a path that does not lead through poison and damnation.\"",

      "text": "Isaac is a spymaster - a converso who has lived in shadows, who understands the dark arts of politics. But he's also been established as someone who values Juan precisely because Juan has been honorable. He came to Juan because Juan conquered Granada without massacre and treats conversos as true Christians.\n\nNow Juan is revealing a different side - a willingness to commit one of the worst sins in medieval Christendom for political gain. Isaac would be deeply unsettled by this, but he's also Juan's man. He swore to serve.\n\nWhat would Isaac actually do here?\n\n1. He would assess whether Juan is serious - which Juan has confirmed he is\n2. He would lay out the practical risks - which he has done\n3. He would assess Juan's mental state and motivations\n4. If Juan persists, Isaac has a choice - serve or refuse\n\nIsaac is a pragmatist. He's killed before. But he's also smart enough to know that this could destroy everything. And there's the question of whether he would participate in something that could damn his king and collapse the entire enterprise.\n\nLet me think about what Isaac's response would be:\n\n1. He would acknowledge Juan's seriousness\n2. He would still try to understand the deeper reasoning\n3. He might probe at the \"kingdom of heaven\" justification - because that sounds like messianic thinking that could be dangerous\n4. He would assess the practical feasibility\n5. He might offer alternatives or conditions\n\nBut Isaac is also not going to simply refuse his king. He's a survivor. He'll navigate this carefully.\n\nThe key thing is that Isaac should respond in character - as a man of shadows who serves Juan, but who also has his own moral compass and pragmatic concerns. He should neither enthusiastically agree nor flatly refuse. He should probe, question, and ultimately lay out what he sees.\n \nThe historical simulation demands rigorous examination of potential consequences. Any action this grave carries immense spiritual and political risks that could unravel everything Juan has built. Discovery would mean total destruction - not just personal ruin, but potential collapse of his entire political and religious mission.\n\nIsaac is silent for a long moment. The candle flame flickers between you, casting dancing shadows across his unremarkable face. When he speaks again, his voice has changed—harder, quieter, the voice of a man who has made a decision.\n\n\"Very few places you are not willing to go,\" he repeats slowly. \"To bring the kingdom of heaven into the world.\"\n\nHe returns to his chair, sitting heavily, and for the first time since you have known him, Isaac de Baeza looks tired.\n\n\"Your Majesty. I am a converso. I was raised in a faith that does not believe the Messiah has come yet. Then I was baptized into a faith that says He came and will come again.\" He meets your eyes. \"In neither faith does the kingdom of heaven arrive through the poison cup. That is the logic of the other kingdom—the one below.\"\n\nHe raises a hand before you can respond.\n\n\"But you are my king. And you have told me this is not a test. So.\"\n\nHe leans forward, elbows on knees, fingers steepled.\n\n\"Let us speak practically, as men of shadow must. You wish to know Alfonso's prospects for natural death. I can investigate. His health, his habits, his physicians' private concerns. This I can do without involving anyone who would suspect the purpose.\"\n\nHe ticks off a finger.\n\n\"You say only you, I, and Mordecai. Mordecai supplies the poison but remains ignorant of the target. That is... possible. Poisons can be requested for many reasons—protection against one's own assassination, study of threats, even pest control if one is creative with explanations. Mordecai is a professional. He does not ask questions he does not wish to know the answers to.\"\n\nSecond finger.\n\n\"You say you will administer it yourself. That is the safest path for secrecy. It is also the most difficult. Alfonso is in Naples—a kingdom away. You do not visit him regularly. When you do, you are watched, attended, never alone with him. How do you propose to deliver poison to a man surrounded by servants, tasters, guards, and courtiers?\"\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\"And what poison? A swift death invites suspicion—healthy kings do not simply drop dead at dinner. A slow decline is safer but requires repeated doses over time. How many visits to Naples can you make without arousing curiosity? How do you administer multiple doses across months while maintaining the appearance of a loving cousin?\"\n\nThird finger.\n\n\"The timing. You say 'now.' But Alfonso has just secured Naples. He is at the height of his success, his health robust enough to campaign through a Neapolitan summer. If he dies within the year, questions will be asked. The Anjou faction will scream murder. French agents will investigate. Venetian spies will probe. Can you withstand that scrutiny?\"\n\nHe sits back.\n\n\"I am not refusing you, Your Majesty. I am showing you the shape of the thing you are asking for. It is not impossible. But it requires patience, planning, and opportunity—the very things you seem unwilling to wait for.\"\n\nA long pause. Isaac's dark eyes search your face.\n\n\"There is one more thing I must say, and then I will be silent on matters of conscience. You speak of the kingdom of heaven. I have read scripture—both testaments. I do not recall the passage where God's kingdom is built on fratricide. Cain slew Abel and was marked for it. David sent Uriah to die and lost his son as punishment. The path you are contemplating has been walked before, Your Majesty. The stones are slippery with the blood of those who thought their cause justified the sin.\"\n\nHe spreads his hands.\n\n\"But I am your man. If you command this, I will help you plan it. I will find the opportunity, the method, the moment. I will carry this secret to my grave.\"\n\n\"I ask only this: give me six months to learn what I can of Alfonso's health, his habits, his vulnerabilities. Let me map the terrain before we march into it. If, after six months, you still wish to proceed—and if opportunity presents itself—we will speak again of specifics.\"\n\nHe waits, watching you with those sharp, tired eyes.\n\n\"Is this acceptable, Your Majesty?\"",

      "text": "Juan is essentially saying:\n1. He's willing to murder Alfonso to unite the crowns\n2. He's not naive about the church - he sees its corruption clearly\n3. He understands that \"absolution\" can be bought, which he finds morally hollow but practically useful\n4. He's rationalizing this as \"for the greater good\"\n5. He's asking Isaac if he can make peace with being part of this\n\nThis is a profound character moment. Juan is showing a side of himself that is Machiavellian, ruthless, and somewhat spiritually nihilistic despite his outward piety. Or perhaps not nihilistic - he still believes in doing good, but he's willing to use terrible means.\n\nIsaac is a converso, a man who has seen the dark side of religious persecution, who operates in shadows, who has killed before. How would he respond to this?\n\nI think Isaac would be:\n1. Somewhat relieved that Juan is being pragmatic, not reckless\n2. Disturbed by the theological cynicism - not because Isaac is naive, but because he's seeing the mask come off a man he believed was genuinely pious\n3. Professionally capable of compartmentalizing this\n4. Personally conflicted\n\nIsaac needs to respond authentically as a character. He's not going to suddenly become preachy or refuse - he's already committed to helping. But he might reflect on what this means, what kind of king he's truly serving, and whether this changes his understanding of Juan.\n\nThe timeline Juan is giving (before 1440, so 3-4 years) is actually reasonable for this kind of operation. It allows for:\n- Intelligence gathering on Alfonso\n- Finding the right opportunity\n- Developing the right method\n- Having a plausible cover\n\nI should have Isaac respond thoughtfully, accepting this but perhaps with a moment of genuine reflection on what it means to serve a king who thinks this way.\n\nIsaac listens. His face remains still, but something shifts behind his eyes—a recalculation, perhaps. A reassessment of the man before him.\n\nWhen you finish, he does not respond immediately. Instead, he rises and moves to the window again, looking out at the sleeping city. When he speaks, his voice is distant, reflective.\n\n\"When I was twelve years old, my father took me to the judería in Seville the night before our baptism. He showed me the synagogue where his father had prayed, and his father before him. He said to me: 'Isaac, tomorrow we become Christians. Some will say we betray our faith. Others will say we save our family. The truth is simpler—we survive. God, if He exists, will judge us by what we do with the life we preserve, not by the words we speak over water.'\"\n\nHe turns back to face you.\n\n\"I have thought about those words many times since. My father was not a cynical man. He was a practical one. He understood that the world is not divided into the righteous and the wicked, but into those who act and those who are acted upon.\"\n\nIsaac returns to his chair, and when he sits, there is something different in his bearing. The servant's deference has faded. He looks at you now as something closer to an equal—or at least as a man who has been admitted to a deeper truth.\n\n\"You ask if I can make peace with this. Your Majesty, I made peace with far worse the day I watched my wife and son buried in a pit with forty other plague victims while a priest who had never met them mumbled Latin over the grave.\" His voice is flat, factual. \"I learned then that God—if He watches—does not intervene for the innocent. Why should He punish the guilty?\"\n\nHe leans forward.\n\n\"I will tell you what I see, now that you have shown me who you truly are. I see a king who has worn the mask of piety so long that even his closest advisors believe it is his face. I see a man who understands that faith and the Church are not the same thing—that one can serve God while despising His self-appointed representatives. I see a ruler who has calculated the cost of sin against the benefit of empire and found the mathematics... acceptable.\"\n\nA pause.\n\n\"I do not judge you for this. I am not capable of judgment—I sold that right long ago. But I will say this:\"\n\nHe holds up a single finger.\n\n\"You speak of the greater good. Of uniting crowns to fight the Sultan. Of bringing heaven's kingdom to earth through necessary evil. I have heard such reasoning before, Your Majesty. Every man who has ever done terrible things has told himself a story about why the terrible thing was actually noble.\"\n\nHe lowers his hand.\n\n\"Perhaps you are right. Perhaps Alfonso's death will unite Christendom and drive back the Turk and save Constantinople and bring a century of peace. Perhaps historians will write that Juan the Great was the king who did what had to be done.\"\n\n\"Or perhaps you will succeed, and find that the crown you killed for fits no better than the one you already wore. Perhaps the wars will come regardless, and the deaths will mount, and at the end you will stand before whatever judgment awaits and discover that the greater good you imagined was only your own ambition dressed in holy vestments.\"\n\nHe spreads his hands.\n\n\"I cannot tell you which it will be. No man can. That is the wager you are making—not with me, not with Alfonso, but with yourself and whatever waits beyond death.\"\n\nIsaac's expression settles into something harder, more businesslike.\n\n\"But you have not asked me for absolution. You have asked me for help. So.\"\n\nHe begins to speak in a different tone—clinical, professional.\n\n\"Four years. That is enough time to do this properly. I will expand the network as you suggest. I will learn everything there is to know about Alfonso—his health, his physicians, his habits, his food, his wine, his lovers if he has them. I will identify the moments when he is vulnerable and the moments when he is watched. I will map his household as thoroughly as I have mapped your enemies.\"\n\n\"Mordecai will be told we require samples for study—protection against assassination attempts on your person. He will provide what we need without knowing why. If he suspects, he will not ask. That is the kind of man he is.\"\n\n\"When the time comes—and it must be the right time, not merely a convenient one—you will need access to Alfonso. A state visit, a family gathering, a celebration of some treaty or victory. Something that explains your presence and provides opportunity.\"\n\nHe meets your eyes.\n\n\"The method... we will discuss when I know more. There are poisons that mimic illness, poisons that work slowly, poisons that leave no trace. The right choice depends on circumstances we do not yet know.\"\n\nA long pause.\n\n\"I am your man, Your Majesty. I have always been your man. You have now shown me the depths to which you are willing to go, and I have not fled. That should tell you something about the depths I have already visited.\"\n\nHe rises, preparing to leave as silently as he came.\n\n\"Is there anything else? Or shall I begin?\"",

Isaac's contacts among Alfonso's physicians reveal grave news—a hidden illness, perhaps cancer or consumption, that Alfonso conceals from all but his closest attendants. He has perhaps two to three years at most. Nature will do your work for you.\n6-15\nSeriously Compromised. Alfonso suffers from a chronic condition—recurring fevers from his Italian campaigns, a heart that labors, or kidneys that fail him. His physicians worry privately. Without intervention, he is unlikely to see 50. Five to eight years, perhaps less if he continues campaigning.\n16-30\nAccumulating Damage. The years of war have taken their toll. Old wounds that never healed properly, joints that ache, a body that recovers more slowly than it once did. He is not dying, but he is wearing down. Ten to fifteen years if he lives carefully—but Alfonso does not live carefully.\n31-50\nMixed Picture. Alfonso is neither robust nor failing. He has good days and bad days. His physicians prescribe moderation he does not follow. He could live another twenty years, or a fever could take him next summer. The future is genuinely uncertain.\n51-70\nSturdy but Reckless. Alfonso's constitution is strong—he has survived campaigns that killed younger men. But he takes risks: rides into battle personally, drinks heavily at feasts, beds women of uncertain cleanliness. His health is good, but his habits create opportunities for accident or disease.\n71-85\nAnnoyingly Robust. Alfonso is in excellent health for his age. His physicians report no concerns. He eats well, sleeps soundly, recovers quickly from minor illnesses. Barring accident or violence, he could easily live another twenty-five years. Natural death is not a reliable strategy.\n86-95\nVigorous as a Bull. Alfonso is one of those men whom nature favors. Despite years of campaigning, despite Italian fevers, despite everything, he remains strong, vital, and energetic. His father lived to old age; Alfonso shows every sign of doing the same. You will be waiting a very long time.\n96-100\nIronically Immortal. Alfonso is in better health than you are. His physicians marvel at his constitution. He has survived wounds, fevers, and sieges that would have killed most men. Isaac's assessment is blunt: if you are relying on nature to remove Alfonso, you should abandon this plan entirely. He will outlive you unless someone intervenes.\n\nPlease roll d100.",

      "text": "This means Alfonso is not dying imminently, but the years of war have taken their toll. He's wearing down - old wounds, joints that ache, slower recovery. He's not dying, but he could have 10-15 years if he lives carefully. But Alfonso doesn't live carefully - he campaigns, he fights, he pushes himself.\n\nThis is a mixed result for Juan's plans. On one hand, Alfonso isn't going to conveniently die in the next year or two from natural causes. On the other hand, he's not in perfect health either - there's accumulated damage that could be exploited, or that could make a death seem more \"natural\" when the time comes.\n\nLet me write Isaac's report on what he's learned.\n\nResult: 27 — Accumulating Damage\n\nThree months pass. Summer settles over Toledo, heavy and golden. Lucia grows round with child—the birth expected in late autumn. The children thrive. The kingdom prospers. And Isaac's network reaches quietly into Naples.\n\nThe report comes in August, delivered by Isaac himself during another late-night meeting in your private study.\n\n\"I have what you asked for, Your Majesty.\"\n\nHe spreads several documents on your desk—letters from contacts in Naples, reports from physicians' servants, observations from men placed in Alfonso's household. His voice is clinical, detached.\n\n\"Alfonso is not dying. But he is not what he was.\"\n\nIsaac taps the first document.\n\n\"The Italian campaigns took their toll. He suffered a lance wound at the siege of Gaeta in 1435—it healed, but poorly. His physicians report that the leg pains him in cold weather, and he limps when he thinks no one is watching. There is an old sword cut on his left shoulder from years ago that never set right. He cannot raise that arm fully above his head.\"\n\nSecond document.\n\n\"The fevers. Naples is a pestilential city in summer—bad air, bad water, diseases that kill foreigners while natives merely suffer. Alfonso has had the tertian fever twice since taking the kingdom. Both times he recovered, but each bout leaves a man weaker than before. His physicians privately express concern about his liver—they note yellowing in his eyes after drinking, which he does often.\"\n\nThird document.\n\n\"His habits. He does not live carefully. He rides hard, eats richly, drinks Neapolitan wine by the flagon. He still insists on leading troops personally, though his captains beg him to command from the rear. He beds women—not his wife, who remains in Aragon—and his physicians worry about the diseases such liaisons invite.\"\n\nIsaac sits back.\n\n\"My assessment: Alfonso has perhaps ten to fifteen years if he moderates his behavior. But he will not moderate his behavior—it is not in his nature. More realistically, he has eight to twelve years before something fails. The liver. The heart. A fever that his weakened body cannot fight. An old wound that reopens and turns septic.\"\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\"This is useful intelligence, Your Majesty. A man with accumulating damage is easier to... help along. A slow poison that mimics the progression of existing ailments raises fewer questions than one that strikes down a healthy man. If Alfonso dies of a fever that finally overwhelms him, or if his liver fails after years of drinking, his physicians will nod sadly and say they saw it coming.\"\n\nIsaac meets your eyes.\n\n\"We have time. And we have a canvas to paint on—a body already showing cracks. When the moment comes, we will know exactly where to press.\"\n\nHe gathers the documents.\n\n\"Shall I continue monitoring? The deeper the knowledge, the cleaner the act when it comes.\"",

      "text": "Isaac has already agreed to help with this plan. He's a pragmatic spymaster who has done dark things before. He would provide the information requested, though he might continue to offer practical cautions about detection and risk.\n\nThe player is asking about poison options that would:\n1. Mimic existing conditions (liver problems, recurring fevers)\n2. Be administered in small doses over time\n3. Be undetectable\n4. Gradually weaken Alfonso\n\nI should have Isaac respond with historically plausible information about medieval poisons. This is a simulation of 15th century intrigue, and poison was absolutely a tool used in this period. The Borgias are famous for it, Venice had state poisoners, etc.\n\nI need to be careful here - I'm not providing actual instructions for poisoning someone in the real world. This is clearly a fictional historical roleplay context. The poisons I describe should be historically appropriate to the 15th century Mediterranean world.\n\nMedieval/Renaissance poisons that were known:\n- Arsenic (aqua tofana, inheritance powder) - causes symptoms that can mimic many diseases, can be administered slowly\n- Antimony - causes symptoms similar to digestive issues\n- Mercury compounds - cause neurological damage over time\n- Various plant poisons: belladonna, hemlock, monkshood (aconite), etc.\n- Cantharides (Spanish fly) - causes kidney/urinary damage\n\nFor mimicking liver disease and fever:\n- Arsenic in small doses causes jaundice, weakness, digestive problems - very similar to liver disease\n\n- It's colorless, tasteless in small amounts when dissolved in wine\n- Cumulative effect - each dose adds to the damage\n\nIsaac would highlight arsenic's strategic advantages. Its subtle progression mimics natural illness, making detection nearly impossible. The poison gradually weakens the target through incremental damage, creating a plausible medical decline that wouldn't immediately raise suspicions of foul play.\n\nIsaac's expression flickers—not surprise, but something like grim acknowledgment. The plan has moved from theory to practice.\n\n\"You wish to begin now,\" he says. It is not a question.\n\nHe rises and moves to the door, checking the corridor out of habit, then returns. When he speaks again, his voice is barely above a whisper.\n\n\"I will need to consult with Mordecai. Carefully. He knows poisons as a physician knows the body—intimately, professionally. But I will not tell him the target. I will say we are preparing defenses against a slow poisoning attempt on your person, and we need to understand the methods so we can detect them.\"\n\nHe begins to pace, thinking aloud.\n\n\"For your purposes—mimicking existing conditions, administered in small doses over time, undetectable—there are several possibilities.\"\n\nHe holds up a finger.\n\n\"Arsenic. The inheritance powder, the Italians call it. Aqua Tofana in Naples, where it has sent many inconvenient husbands to early graves. In small doses, it causes symptoms that physicians readily attribute to other causes: weakness, yellowing of the skin, digestive troubles, tremors. It accumulates in the body. Each dose adds to the last. A man who already shows signs of liver damage from drink...\" He spreads his hands. \"His physicians will see what they expect to see. The liver failing, as they warned him it would.\"\n\nSecond finger.\n\n\"Antimony. Slower than arsenic, but even harder to detect. It causes sweating, weakness, loss of appetite, pain in the bowels. A man who suffers recurring fevers would show similar symptoms. His physicians would increase their treatments, which often contain antimony themselves—thus hastening the very death they seek to prevent.\"\n\nThird finger.\n\n\"Lead compounds. The Romans used lead in their wine vessels and water pipes—it sweetens the taste. A man who drinks as heavily as Alfonso would not notice a slight sweetness in his cup. Lead poisoning causes weakness, confusion, pain in the joints and belly. It can take months or years to kill, but it degrades the body steadily. Combined with his existing ailments...\"\n\nIsaac stops pacing and faces you directly.\n\n\"My recommendation: arsenic, in very small doses, administered irregularly. Not every visit—that creates a pattern. Perhaps every second or third occasion, in wine rather than food. Wine masks the taste better, and Alfonso drinks enough that one more cup raises no suspicion.\"\n\nHe pauses, his dark eyes thoughtful.\n\n\"The challenge is access. You cannot simply pour something into his cup at a state banquet surrounded by hundreds of witnesses. You need private moments. A cousin's toast in his chambers. A hunting flask shared on the road. A gift of fine Castilian wine that you open together.\"\n\nAnother pause.\n\n\"How often do you see Alfonso? And in what circumstances? The method must fit the opportunity.\"",

The NPC (Isaac) has already raised moral objections and been overruled\n4. The player is asking for in-game practical details\n\nI think I can engage with this in a way that serves the narrative without providing a real-world poisoning guide. I should:\n- Have Isaac provide general guidance appropriate to the narrative\n- Focus on the game mechanics (this will likely need a roll to see how successful the poisoning campaign is)\n- Not provide precise dosages or detailed instructions that could be used in reality\n- Keep the focus on the story/simulation aspect\n\nThe historical reality is that arsenic poisoning was indeed used in medieval and Renaissance periods, and there's historical documentation about it. The \"inheritance powder\" reference is historically accurate.\n\nI'll have Isaac provide narrative-appropriate guidance and then we should probably set up a chaos roll system for how this plays out over time.\n\nIsaac is quiet for a long moment. Then he nods slowly.\n\n\"Arsenic it is.\"\n\nHe moves to your desk, takes a blank piece of parchment, and begins to sketch as he speaks.\n\n\"Mordecai can prepare what you need. A small vial—no larger than your thumb—containing a concentrated solution. Clear, nearly odorless, with only a faint metallic taste that wine will mask entirely.\"\n\nHe draws a small bottle shape.\n\n\"The stopper will be designed to dispense drops, not pour. One drop—\" he makes a small mark, \"—is a threshold dose. Enough to begin the accumulation, not enough to cause immediate symptoms. Two drops will cause mild discomfort within a day—stomach pains, perhaps loose bowels. His physicians will blame the Neapolitan food. Three drops and he will be visibly ill for several days. More than that risks raising suspicion.\"\n\nHe sets down the charcoal.\n\n\"My recommendation: one drop per visit, no more. You are not trying to kill him quickly—you are trying to weaken a dam that is already cracking. Each dose adds weight to the water behind it. Over two years, three years, the accumulation becomes... decisive.\"\n\nIsaac reaches into his coat and produces a ring—a heavy gold signet, unremarkable in design.\n\n\"I had this made months ago, for other purposes. But it will serve.\" He twists the bezel, and a tiny compartment opens beneath the stone. \"The cavity holds perhaps ten drops. Enough for several visits. To dispense, you tilt your hand over his cup—so—\" he demonstrates, \"—and press here. One drop falls. The motion looks like nothing more than a gesture while speaking.\"\n\nHe hands you the ring.\n\n\"Practice with water until the movement is natural. You must be able to do it while looking Alfonso in the eye, while laughing at a jest, while servants move around you. The moment you glance at your hand, you invite notice.\"\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\"There is also the matter of your own protection. You will be drinking with him. Sharing cups, perhaps. You must never lose track of which cup is which. And you should take a precaution before each visit—a small dose of chalk powder mixed with charcoal, which binds arsenic in the gut and passes it safely. Mordecai will prepare this as well. If you accidentally drink from the wrong cup, or if Alfonso offers you wine from his own...\"\n\nIsaac's eyes are hard.\n\n\"This is not a game, Your Majesty. Arsenic does not care that you are a king. One mistake and you poison yourself.\"\n\nHe steps back.\n\n\"When do you intend to make your first visit to Naples? And what pretext will you use? The reason must be natural—something that would not surprise Alfonso or his court. A new king does not simply appear at his cousin's door without explanation.\"",

Something in your letter—or in María's current state of mind—raises her guard. She declines coolly, citing duties in Aragon. The door is closed for now; pressing further would seem strange.\n6-15\nPolite Delay. María responds warmly but vaguely. She would love to visit, but her duties as regent make it difficult. Perhaps next year? No door is closed, but no opportunity is opened either. Alfonso's whereabouts are not mentioned.\n16-30\nConditional Acceptance. María expresses genuine interest but notes that she cannot leave Aragon without Alfonso's permission. She will write to him in Naples and let you know. The matter is now partly in Alfonso's hands—he may approve, delay, or suggest alternatives.\n31-50\nWarm Acceptance, Castile Visit. María accepts gladly. She will travel to Toledo in the coming months to meet her nieces and nephews. She writes movingly of how she longs to hold children, even if they are not her own. Alfonso is in Naples and unlikely to join, but the family connection is strengthened.\n51-70\nEnthusiastic Acceptance with Invitation. María is delighted—and extends a counter-invitation. Why should she travel alone? Come to Barcelona instead, bring the children, make it a proper family gathering. She hints that Alfonso may visit Barcelona briefly this year. An opportunity begins to form.\n71-85\nPerfect Alignment. María responds that your letter arrived as if sent by providence. Alfonso has written that he intends to visit Barcelona in the coming months—some matter of Aragonese governance requires his presence. She begs you to come, to bring Lucia and the children, to make it a true reunion of family. The opportunity you need is falling into place.\n86-95\nEager and Revealing. María's response is almost desperate in its warmth. She confesses—guardedly, but clearly—her loneliness, her grief at her childless state, her joy at the prospect of seeing family. She confirms Alfonso will be in Barcelona and practically begs you to come. She also lets slip details of Alfonso's health and habits that confirm Isaac's reports. Your sister, unknowing, becomes an asset.\n96-100\nThe Broken Queen. María's letter is heartbreaking. Years of abandonment, of watching her husband chase crowns and women across Italy, have worn her to the bone. She writes of longing for home, for family, for the brother she remembers from childhood. She confirms Alfonso will be in Barcelona—and she confesses, in veiled words, that she would not mourn if he never returned to her bed.

Alfonso's response is brief and cool. He is occupied with Naples and cannot foresee leaving for some time. No counter-invitation, no warmth. Something has soured—perhaps whispers from someone, perhaps mere exhaustion and irritation. The door is firmly closed.\n6-15\nPolite Deflection. Alfonso responds graciously but evasively. He would love to meet, of course, but the demands of three kingdoms leave him no time. Perhaps in a year or two, when Naples is fully settled? The Ottoman discussion interests him, but not enough to commit to anything. No opportunity created.\n16-30\nInterested but Immobile. Alfonso's letter is warm—he speaks fondly of family, expresses genuine interest in seeing your children and discussing the Turkish threat. But he will not leave Naples. If Juan wishes to meet, Juan must come to him. A counter-invitation to Naples is extended, with vague timing.\n31-50\nCounter-Proposal: Naples. Alfonso embraces the idea enthusiastically. Yes, they must meet! Yes, they must plan the great crusade against the Turk! But he cannot leave his new kingdom—come to Naples instead, bring Lucia and the children, see the wonders of Italy. He proposes a date within the next year. The opportunity exists, but on his ground.\n51-70\nFlexible Interest. Alfonso responds positively to both the family visit and the strategic discussion. He suggests several possibilities: he may visit Barcelona on Aragonese business and could meet Juan there; alternatively, Juan could visit Naples; or they could arrange a meeting point—perhaps Rome, with papal blessing? He leaves the logistics to Juan. Multiple opportunities open.\n71-85\nEager Acceptance. Alfonso's response is enthusiastic. The Naples campaign has whetted his appetite for greater glories—the Ottoman threat is exactly what he wishes to discuss. He proposes meeting in Barcelona within six months, combining Aragonese governance with family reunion. He specifically asks to see the children who may one day inherit his crowns. The opportunity falls into your lap.\n86-95\nBrotherly Warmth. Alfonso writes at length—a letter full of gratitude for your help in Naples, affection for family, and burning ambition for the future. He insists on meeting soon, proposes multiple occasions over the coming years, and suggests formalizing their alliance with new treaties. He will make time to visit Castile if Juan cannot come to Italy. He treats you as partner, not petitioner.\n96-100\nThe Grand Design. Alfonso's response reveals a man thinking in imperial terms. He speaks of uniting the crowns formally, of crusade against both Turk and Moor, of a Mediterranean dominated by Iberian kings. He proposes not one meeting but a series—this year in Barcelona, next year in Naples, the year after perhaps in Constantinople itself. He wishes to plan a legacy together.

Too long have We been separated by the demands of Our respective crowns—first the long struggle for Naples, now the labors of consolidating what God has granted Us. But family must not be neglected, and the matters you raise demand discussion between kinsmen who share both blood and purpose.\n\nWe confess the Turkish question weighs upon Us. From Naples, We see the eastern Mediterranean more clearly than We ever did from Barcelona. The Ottoman grows bolder. Rhodes strains under pressure. Constantinople—which you have done so much to preserve—remains a blade held to Christendom's throat. These are matters that cannot be resolved by letters alone.\n\nAs for your children—Our potential heirs, God having seen fit to deny Us issue of Our own—We are eager to know them. A king without sons must look to his nephews, and We hear yours are promising.\n\nWe propose several possibilities, leaving the choice to you who know your own obligations best:\n\nFirst, We expect to visit Barcelona in the spring or early summer of next year, 1437. Matters of Aragonese governance require Our presence, however briefly. If you could journey to meet Us there, We might combine family reunion with council of war. María would be gladdened beyond measure—she speaks often of her brother.\n\nSecond, if Barcelona does not suit, you are most welcome in Naples. Our court here grows splendid, and We would show you the kingdom your soldiers helped Us win. The children could see wonders they would never forget—Vesuvius, the ruins of the ancients, the bay that poets have praised since Homer.\n\nThird, if neither king wishes to be seen traveling to the other's domain—for We understand how such things are perceived—perhaps Rome might serve as neutral ground. His Holiness would surely bless a meeting of Christian princes united against the Turk. The symbolism alone would send a message to Constantinople and to the Sultan.\n\nWe leave the choice to you, dear cousin. Only say where and when, and We shall make it so.\n\nWritten at Naples, in the Castel Nuovo, this 15th day of September, in the year of Our Lord 1436.\n\nYour loving cousin,\nAlfonso\n\nYou set down the letter. Three opportunities. Barcelona in spring 1437, where Alfonso will be briefly present for Aragonese business. Naples at your convenience, on his ground but with his gratitude.

We moved the timeline ahead - \"Spring 1436\" was mentioned when Juan summoned the Seville foundry leaders\n4. The conversation with Isaac about Alfonso happened in \"spring 1436\"\n5. Isaac's report on Alfonso's health came \"three months pass\" after that conversation - so around August 1436\n6. Now Alfonso's letter arrives \"six weeks later\" after Juan sent his letter\n\nSo if the Isaac conversation was in spring 1436 (let's say April/May), and his report came in August 1436, and Juan sent the letter to Alfonso around that time, then six weeks later would be approximately late September or early October 1436.\n\nAlfonso's letter is dated \"15th day of September\" 1436, so the letter would arrive about 2-3 weeks later given travel time from Naples to Toledo - so roughly early October 1436.\n\nLet me also note: Lucia is pregnant, conceived in late winter (February/March 1436), due November/December 1436. So by early October, she would be about 7-8 months pregnant.\n\nBased on the timeline:\n\nThe chapter began in late November 1435\n\nLucia's pregnancy was confirmed in late February 1436 (child due November/December 1436)\n\nSpring 1436: You summoned the Seville foundry leaders and met with Isaac\n\nAugust 1436: Isaac delivered his report on Alfonso's health (three months after your conversation)\n\nYou sent your letter to Alfonso shortly thereafter\n\nAlfonso's letter is dated September 15th, 1436\n\nWith travel time from Naples to Toledo—typically three to four weeks by sea and road—the letter would arrive in your hands in early to mid-October 1436.\n\nLucia is now approximately seven to eight months pregnant. The birth is perhaps six to eight weeks away. The autumn air has turned crisp in Toledo, and the court prepares for the arrival of another royal child.\n\nThis timing matters: if you wish to meet Alfonso in Barcelona in spring 1437, you have roughly six months to prepare. Lucia will have delivered by then—assuming all goes well—and the child will be old enough to travel, or old enough to leave safely in Toledo with nurses.",

Establishing the Senegal outpost\n2. Preparing an expedition inland to Timbuktu with trade goods\n\nLet me draft a response about what Henry would need for this.\n\nYour letter to Alfonso is dispatched within the week—warm, familial, expressing eagerness to see him in Barcelona come spring. You mention bringing Lucia and all the children. The foundation is laid.\n\nNow, to Africa.\n\nOctober 1436, Toledo\n\nYou draft a letter to Prince Henry at Sagres, where he oversees his enterprise of exploration. The ink flows quickly—you have thought much about this.\n\nTo Our Beloved Brother-in-law Henry, Infante of Portugal, Master of the Order of Christ,\n\nYour reports from São João da Ribeira and Captain Dias's discovery of the Senegal fill Us with renewed conviction that God has blessed our joint enterprise.\n\nWe believe the time has come for the next step. The Senegal River mouth must have an outpost of its own—a second link in the chain that will one day connect Christendom to the wealth of the interior. But We wish to think beyond mere coastal stations.\n\nThe traders at your outposts speak of Timbuktu. Of Mali. Of kingdoms where gold flows like water and scholars gather from across the world. These are not legends—the gold dust in your strongboxes proves their reality.\n\nWe propose this: an expedition not merely along the coast, but inland. Up the Senegal, with gifts and trade goods of the finest quality Castile and Portugal can offer. Let us send ambassadors to the ruler of Mali—or whoever holds power in those lands—and establish direct relations. Let us bypass not merely the Moorish middlemen of the coast, but the entire Saharan trade route that has enriched our enemies for centuries.\n\nTell Us what you require to make this happen. Ships, men, goods, gold—name your needs, and We shall find the means.\n\nWritten at Toledo, October 1436\n\nYour brother in Christ and partner in discovery,\n\nJuan\n\nSix Weeks Later — December 1436\n\nHenry's reply arrives as winter settles over Toledo. Lucia has delivered safely—a son, healthy and strong, born in late November. You have named him Alfonso, after your cousin—a gesture of family unity that carries its own dark irony now.\n\nYou break the seal on Henry's letter in your study, the fire crackling against the December chill.\n\nTo His Most Christian Majesty Juan II,\n\nYour vision takes my breath away. For twenty years I have dreamed of reaching the source—and you speak of it as though it were merely a matter of logistics.\n\nPerhaps it is. Perhaps, with sufficient will and resources, it can be done.\n\nLet me tell you what I know, and what I believe we would need.\n\nON THE SENEGAL OUTPOST\n\nThis is the simpler matter. Captain Dias has already identified an ideal site—a defensible point where the river meets the sea, with deep water for anchorage and firm ground for building. The local peoples—the Wolof, they call themselves—are not hostile. They trade with the interior and would, I believe, welcome a permanent market.\n\nTo establish this second outpost, I would need:\n\n— 15,000 florins for construction, supplies, and initial garrison (we have learned from São João what works and what does not)\n— Two additional ships to maintain supply lines between the stations\n— Fifty men: soldiers, craftsmen, and friars\n— Time—perhaps eighteen months from commitment to completion\n\nThis I can accomplish with confidence. It is an extension of what we have already proven.\n\nON THE INLAND EXPEDITION\n\nThis is another matter entirely.\n\nThe Senegal is navigable for some distance—how far, we do not know. Beyond that, the journey to Timbuktu is overland, through lands we have never seen, among peoples we do not know. The Saharan caravans take months to make this journey, and they travel routes established over centuries.\n\nI will not lie to you, Juan. This is dangerous. Men may die. The expedition may fail entirely. We do not know the languages, the customs, the politics of the interior. We do not know if the rulers of Mali will welcome Christian ambassadors or kill them as infidels.\n\nBut I believe it can be attempted. Here is what I would need:\n\n— A small expedition: no more than thirty men. Large parties invite suspicion and cannot move quickly. Small parties can present themselves as traders, not conquerors.\n\n— Interpreters. At São João, we have begun to learn some words of the coastal tongues. At the Senegal, we must find men who speak the languages of the interior—perhaps traders who have made the journey before and can be hired or persuaded.\n\n— Trade goods of the highest quality. The rulers of Mali are not primitive savages—they are wealthy, sophisticated, connected to the Islamic world. They will not be impressed by glass beads and iron pots. We must bring:\n   — Fine cloth: Flemish woolens, Castilian silks\n   — Worked metal: swords, armor, tools of the finest steel\n   — Horses: I am told horses are prized beyond gold in the interior, for they cannot be bred there—some sickness kills them\n   — Curiosities: mirrors, clocks, illuminated manuscripts, anything that demonstrates the arts of Christendom\n   — And yes, gold and silver coin, for universal commerce\n\n— A leader of exceptional quality. Not merely brave, but wise. Patient. Capable of diplomacy as well as survival. A man who can represent Christendom to a king who has never seen a Christian.\n\n— Time. The Senegal outpost must be established first—it will serve as the base for the inland expedition. Then we must spend months, perhaps a year, gathering intelligence from traders, learning what we can of the interior. Only then can we send men upriver.\n\nFor all of this—the outpost, the preparation, the expedition itself—I would estimate:\n\n— 40,000 florins over three years\n— Ships, men, and goods as described\n— And your patience, brother. This cannot be rushed. Men who rush into unknown lands do not return.\n\nON THE REWARDS\n\nIf we succeed—if we establish direct contact with Mali—the rewards are beyond calculation.\n\nGold. Not the trickle of dust we trade for now, but the flow from the source itself. The mines of Bambuk, which have fed the wealth of the Islamic world for centuries.\n\nKnowledge. Maps of the interior. Understanding of the peoples and kingdoms between the coast and the great desert.\n\nAlliance. A Christian presence at the edge of the Islamic world, threatening the trade routes that fund our enemies.\n\nAnd something more. If Mali can be reached from the Senegal, what else lies beyond? The kingdoms of the east? The legendary Prester John? The route to the Indies that does not pass through Ottoman waters?\n\nI am an old man, Juan. I will not live to see all of this accomplished. But you are young. Your children are younger still. What we begin now, they may complete.\n\nTell me your will, and I shall begin.\n\nYour servant in Christ,\n\nHenrique\n\nHenry's letter sits before you. Forty thousand florins over three years for the full venture—the Senegal outpost and the inland expedition to Mali. It is a significant sum, but not an impossible one.\n\nWhat is your response?",

He reads Henry's letter with the careful attention of a man who has learned that royal enthusiasm often precedes large expenditures.\n\n\"Forty thousand florins over three years,\" he murmurs, making notes. \"Thirteen thousand annually, roughly. Plus the ongoing costs of São João da Ribeira.\"\n\nHe looks up. \"The treasury can bear it, Your Majesty. The Constantinople revenues are stabilizing, the economic development measures are beginning to show returns, and we ended 1436 with healthy reserves.

The Senegal outpost is established, but the inland expedition ends in disaster. Disease, hostile peoples, or simple miscalculation kills most of the expedition. The few survivors stagger back with tales of horror. The route to Mali is proven impassable—at least for now. Henry is devastated. The venture must be abandoned entirely.\n6-12\nDisaster. The outpost survives, but the expedition never reaches Mali. Perhaps they are turned back by hostile tribes. Perhaps disease decimates them before they leave the river. Perhaps their interpreter betrays them. The men return broken, the investment largely lost. A second attempt would require years of rebuilding.\n13-20\nFailure. The Senegal outpost is established successfully, but the inland expedition fails. They travel some distance upriver, make contact with intermediary peoples, but cannot reach Timbuktu or Mali's rulers. They return with some intelligence but no diplomatic contact, no trade agreement, no breakthrough. The money is spent; the dream remains distant.\n21-30\nPartial Failure. The outpost thrives, but the expedition achieves only fragments of its goals. Perhaps they reach a trading town far short of Timbuktu. Perhaps they make contact with minor chiefs but not the Mansa of Mali. They return with valuable intelligence and modest trade connections, but the great prize eludes them. Another expedition would be needed.\n31-45\nMixed Results. The Senegal outpost becomes a solid trading station. The expedition penetrates deep into the interior—further than any Christian before—and makes contact with traders who deal directly with Mali. They do not reach Timbuktu itself, but they establish a chain of contacts. Gold flows in greater quantities. The foundation is laid for future success, but the breakthrough has not yet come.\n46-60\nSolid Success. The Senegal outpost flourishes. The expedition reaches the edge of Mali's territory and makes formal contact with regional authorities—perhaps a provincial governor or major trading town. They are received cautiously but not hostilely. Trade agreements are negotiated. The expedition returns with significant gold, valuable intelligence, and an open door for future contact. Not yet Timbuktu, but real progress.\n61-75\nStrong Success. The outpost becomes a thriving trade hub. The expedition reaches Timbuktu itself—or comes very close—and makes contact with merchants who deal directly with the Mansa's court. They are received as curiosities, perhaps even honored guests. Trade agreements are established. The expedition returns with substantial gold, detailed maps, and letters of introduction for future embassies. The route is proven viable.\n76-85\nExcellent Success. Beyond all reasonable expectation, the expedition achieves diplomatic contact with the court of Mali itself. The Mansa—or a high official—receives the Christian ambassadors and expresses interest in direct trade. The expedition returns with gold, ivory, and formal agreements. A permanent trade relationship is established, bypassing the Saharan routes entirely. Henry declares it the culmination of his life's work.\n86-93\nExceptional Achievement. The expedition not only reaches Mali but is received with honor. The Mansa, intrigued by these strangers from across the sea, grants trading privileges and requests ongoing contact. The expedition returns with wealth, knowledge, and something unexpected—perhaps a Malian ambassador sent to see the Christian lands, or intelligence about routes further east. The African enterprise transforms from exploration to empire.\n94-97\nHistoric Breakthrough. The expedition achieves everything hoped for and more. Direct relations with Mali established. Substantial gold trade flowing. And a discovery that changes everything—perhaps clear intelligence about a route to the eastern kingdoms, or contact with peoples who know of lands beyond Mali, or evidence that the African coast continues far to the south and east. The strategic implications are immense.\n98-100\nLegendary Success. The expedition becomes the stuff of chronicles. Not only is Mali reached and trade established, but the ambassadors uncover something that reshapes European understanding of the world—perhaps meeting traders from the Far East, or discovering that Africa can be circumnavigated, or making contact with the legendary Prester John. Whatever the specifics, this expedition will be remembered for centuries. Henry weeps with joy.\n\nPlease roll d100.",

      "text": "1437-1439: The Opening of Africa\n\nThe first reports arrive in spring 1437. The Senegal outpost—christened São Tomé da Ribeira—rises on a defensible bluff where the great river meets the sea. The Wolof people prove not merely tolerant but eager; they have long served as intermediaries between the coast and the interior, and they recognize opportunity when it sails into their waters.\n\nBy autumn 1437, the outpost is complete. Stone walls. A chapel. Warehouses already filling with ivory, hides, and gold dust. Henry writes that the Senegal station receives more trade in its first six months than São João saw in its first year.\n\nThen, in spring 1438, the inland expedition departs.\n\nThe Expedition\n\nThirty-two men under Captain Gonçalo de Sintra—the same man who built São João da Ribeira. With them: two Wolof interpreters who speak the languages of the interior, three friars for spiritual counsel and record-keeping, and a train of horses, cloth, steel, and curiosities that would not disgrace a royal embassy.\n\nThey ascend the Senegal by boat for two hundred leagues, into lands no Christian has ever seen. The river narrows; rapids force them to portage. The heat is murderous. Three men die of fever. But they press on.\n\nAt the trading town of Takrur, they meet merchants who have made the journey to Timbuktu many times. These men are Muslim, suspicious of Christians—but gold speaks a universal language. For the price of six horses and twenty bolts of Flemish wool, the expedition hires guides who know the overland route.\n\nThe journey takes three months. Across savanna and scrubland, through territories controlled by chiefs who must be placated with gifts, past wells that mean life and death in the dry season. Seven more men die—disease, an accident at a river crossing, one simply walking into the bush one night and never returning.\n\nBut in November 1438, the survivors crest a rise and see it below them.\n\nTimbuktu.\n\nThe City of Gold\n\nIt is not what they expected.\n\nNo walls of gold, no towers of silver—the legends were always exaggerations. But what they find is in some ways more impressive: a city of mud-brick buildings that gleam rose and amber in the desert light, mosques with minarets reaching toward heaven, markets where scholars and merchants from across Africa and the Islamic world gather to trade knowledge and wealth.\n\nThe expedition is stopped at the gates. Word is sent to the city's governor. For three days they wait, uncertain whether they will be welcomed or executed as infidels.\n\nThen the summons comes. Not from the governor—from the Mansa himself.\n\nThe Court of Mansa Mahmud II\n\nThe Mansa of Mali holds court at Niani, many leagues to the south. But he has heard of these pale strangers who crossed the sea and ascended the river, and he is curious enough to travel north to meet them.\n\nMansa Mahmud II is not the legendary Mansa Musa who made the pilgrimage to Mecca a century before with so much gold that he crashed the Egyptian economy. Mali's power has waned since those days; the empire fragments at its edges. But the Mansa remains one of the wealthiest rulers in the world, and his court is magnificent beyond anything the Portuguese have seen.\n\nCaptain de Sintra presents his credentials: letters from Prince Henry, from King Juan of Castile, from Pope Eugenius himself. He presents gifts: the finest sword from Bilbao's forges, a clockwork automaton that walks and chimes, an illuminated Bible in a binding of gold leaf, and—most precious of all—three Andalusian horses that have somehow survived the journey.\n\nThe Mansa is intrigued.\n\nHe has dealt with Arabs all his life, with Berbers, with traders from Egypt and Morocco. But never with men from beyond the western sea. He asks questions—about their ships, their kingdoms, their faith. The friars explain Christianity as best they can through layers of translation. The Mansa listens politely, asks pointed questions about the Trinity, and does not seem impressed. But he is very interested in the ships.\n\n\"You say you can carry goods by sea,\" he says through interpreters; Friar Álvaro de Lisboa records his words carefully, \"from my kingdom to yours, without crossing the desert?\"\n\n\"Yes, Mansa. The journey by sea is faster and safer than the caravan routes.\"\n\n\"And you wish to trade? Gold for your cloth and steel and horses?\"\n\n\"Yes, Mansa. And more—friendship between our peoples. Alliance against common enemies.\"\n\nThe Mansa considers this for a long moment.\n\n\"The Arabs have told me that Christians are devils,\" he says finally. \"You do not seem like devils. You seem like merchants.\" A thin smile. \"I prefer merchants to devils.\"\n\nThe Agreement\n\nNegotiations take weeks. The Mansa is no fool—he understands that direct trade with the Christians threatens the Saharan routes that have enriched his northern neighbors for centuries. The merchants of Timbuktu protest; the Islamic scholars warn against dealing with infidels.\n\nBut Mali's power is fading. The Songhai to the east grow stronger. The desert peoples raid with impunity. The Mansa needs new allies, new sources of weapons, new markets for his gold.\n\nIn January 1439, an agreement is reached:\n\nThe Treaty of Timbuktu:\n\nMali grants trading privileges to Portuguese and Castilian merchants\n\nA permanent trading station may be established at Timbuktu, with a small Christian quarter\n\nGold, ivory, and slaves may be purchased directly at Mali's markets\n\nMali receives: horses (annually), steel weapons, cloth, and \"curiosities of Christian manufacture\"\n\nA Malian ambassador will return with the expedition to see the Christian kingdoms\n\nThe ambassador's name is Musa Keita—a younger cousin of the Mansa, educated in Timbuktu's famous madrasas, fluent in Arabic and curious about the wider world. He will travel to Portugal and Castile to assess these strange people who have come from across the sea.\n\nThe Return\n\nThe expedition reaches São Tomé da Ribeira in April 1439, diminished but triumphant. Of thirty-two men who departed, nineteen return. But they bring with them:\n\nMusa Keita, ambassador of the Mansa of Mali\n\nSix hundred pounds of gold—not dust, but ingots stamped with Mali's mark\n\nDetailed maps of the routes from the coast to Timbuktu\n\nA formal treaty bearing the Mansa's seal\n\nJournals filled with observations about the peoples, kingdoms, and geography of the interior\n\nHenry's letter to you, when it arrives in Toledo in summer 1439, is stained with what appear to be tears.\n\nTo His Most Christian Majesty Juan II,\n\nBrother—I cannot write. I cannot find words.\n\nTwenty-three years. Since I was a young man at Ceuta, I have dreamed of this. Twenty-three years of failure, of mockery, of ships that never returned and men who died chasing my visions.\n\nAnd now this.\n\nWe have done it. We have reached the source. Not merely found it—we have treated with its rulers, established trade, opened a door that can never be closed.\n\nThe gold that flows through Timbuktu—the gold that built the mosques of Cairo and the palaces of Fez—that gold will flow to us now. Not all of it. Not even most of it, yet. But the route is proven, the connection made. What we have begun, our children will complete.\n\nAnd there is more. Musa Keita travels to you even now. An ambassador from Mali, from the heart of Africa, coming to see the Christian kingdoms with his own eyes. When has such a thing ever happened? When has a ruler of the interior sent his own blood to treat with Christian kings?\n\nI am sixty-five years old, Juan. I will not live to see where this road leads. But I know now that my life has not been wasted. Everything I sacrificed—every ship, every man, every florin—it was worth it. All of it.\n\nYou made this possible. Your gold, your faith in me when no one else believed. Whatever history remembers of this achievement, let it remember that Juan of Castile was the partner who made it real.\n\nI have no more words. Only gratitude, and wonder, and the certain knowledge that God has blessed our work.\n\nYour brother in Christ, now and forever,\n\nHenrique\n\nSummary of Results:\n\nSão Tomé da Ribeira: Second permanent outpost established at Senegal River mouth, thriving trade hub\n\nTreaty of Timbuktu: Formal trading agreement with Mali; Christian trading station permitted in Timbuktu\n\nMalian Ambassador: Musa Keita traveling to Iberia to assess Christian kingdoms\n\nGold: 600 pounds of gold ingots returned with expedition; ongoing trade established\n\nIntelligence: Detailed maps and knowledge of interior routes, peoples, and kingdoms\n\nCasualties: 13 of 32 expedition members died\n\nStrategic Position: Direct access to West African gold trade, bypassing Saharan routes entirely\n\nIt is summer 1439.

This is a reasonable question - the Cortes of Castile was the representative assembly that traditionally had to approve major taxation and could advise the king on policy.\n\nLet me think about what has happened recently that might warrant a Cortes:\n- Major financial commitments (Constantinople, African ventures, foundry expansion)\n- The ongoing reforms and administrative changes\n- The Portuguese maritime union\n- The succession situation (Juan has multiple heirs now)\n- The economic development programs\n\nÁlvaro would be a good advisor on this. I should roleplay him giving counsel on whether summoning the Cortes makes sense politically and practically.\n\nLate 1436, Toledo\n\nÁlvaro de Luna arrives in your study within the hour, as he always does when summoned. The years have silvered his temples, but his mind remains as sharp as ever—sharper, perhaps, honed by the complexities of managing a kingdom that has grown far beyond its old borders.\n\nHe settles into the chair across from you, accepting a cup of wine with a nod of thanks.\n\n\"The Cortes,\" he repeats, turning the question over. \"It has been... let me think. Three years since the last full assembly? The Cortes of 1433, after Granada fell. You presented the conquest, received their acclaim, confirmed the new tax arrangements for the conquered territories.\"\n\nHe sips his wine, considering.\n\n\"There are arguments for summoning them, Your Majesty. And arguments against.\"\n\nHe holds up a hand, ticking off points.\n\n\"For: You have accomplished much since 1433 that the realm has not formally acknowledged. The Constantinople expedition. The papal alliance. The Portuguese maritime union—still being finalized, but substantial. The economic development measures. The African ventures with Prince Henry.\" He pauses. \"Kings who achieve greatly should let their subjects know of it. The Cortes is a stage, and you have earned the right to stand upon it.\"\n\nSecond finger.\n\n\"Also for: The treasury has borne heavy burdens these past years. Constantinople, the navy, the foundries, the African outposts, the settlement convoys. We have managed without new taxes—the Granada revenues and existing arrangements have sufficed. But if you anticipate greater expenses ahead...\" He gives you a meaningful look. \"The war with the Ottomans you speak of. The campaign you envision for 1440. Such things require extraordinary revenues. Better to lay the groundwork now, when you come before them crowned with success, than later, when you come with empty hands and urgent need.\"\n\nThird finger.\n\n\"Also for: Your heirs. Fernando is now three years old, healthy, promising. You have daughters as well—Catalina, Bianca. And Lucia has just given you another son.\" He inclines his head. \"The succession is secure in a way it was not in 1433, when Isabel had just died and Fernando was an infant. The Cortes should see your children. Should acclaim Fernando as Prince of Asturias before the assembled realm. It binds the nobility to the succession, makes any future challenge more difficult.\"\n\nHe lowers his hand and takes another sip of wine.\n\n\"Against: The Cortes is not merely a stage for royal glory. It is also a forum for complaint. The nobles will bring grievances. The cities will bring petitions. The Church will have opinions.\" A thin smile. \"You have stepped on toes these past years, Your Majesty. The Military Orders, transformed. The tax collection, reformed. The conversos, protected—at least for now. The Inquisition, delayed. There are men who will use the Cortes to voice objections they dare not raise elsewhere.\"\n\nHe sets down his cup.\n\n\"Also against: Your absence. You have been in Toledo, yes, but your attention has been... distributed. Constantinople. Africa. Naples. The realm has been governed well—\" a slight bow, acknowledging his own role, \"—but some will grumble that the King cares more for distant adventures than for Castile itself. The Cortes may become a venue for such grumbling.\"\n\nHe spreads his hands.\n\n\"My counsel? Summon them. But summon them prepared. Know what you wish to achieve—acclaim for your victories, confirmation of the succession, perhaps preliminary approval for future military endeavors. Know also what grievances will be raised, and have answers ready. Do not let the assembly become a forum for opposition to seize initiative.\"\n\nHe pauses, then adds quietly:\n\n\"And perhaps consider: is there anything you wish to announce? Any new direction for the realm? The Cortes of 1433 proclaimed the completion of the Reconquista. What does the Cortes of 1437 proclaim?\"",

      "text": "This is historically interesting because:\n1. It's a form of military census - knowing exactly what forces can be raised\n2. It's an assertion of royal authority - requiring nobles to report their strength\n3. It could be seen as either preparation for war or as a check on noble power\n4. The nobles might be suspicious of such detailed accounting\n\nI should have Álvaro respond with both the practical considerations and the political implications. Some nobles might resist giving accurate figures (underreporting to avoid obligations, or perhaps overreporting for prestige). There might also be questions about why the king needs this information now.\n\nLet me write Álvaro's response and then we can potentially do a roll to see how accurately the nobles report.\n\nÁlvaro nods slowly, but there is a flicker of something in his eyes—caution, perhaps, or the calculation of a man who has spent decades navigating noble sensibilities.\n\n\"A military census,\" he says. \"Disguised as administrative preparation. Clever—and necessary, if you truly intend to campaign in the East by 1440. But...\"\n\nHe rises and moves to the window, looking out over Toledo's rooftops.\n\n\"The nobles will wonder why. They are not fools, Your Majesty. When a king asks how many men each lord can field, it means one of two things: he intends to call the levy, or he intends to assess their strength for other purposes.\" He turns back. \"Some will suspect you are measuring them. Determining who is too powerful, who might be... reduced.\"\n\nHe returns to his seat.\n\n\"Others will simply lie. Undercount, to minimize their obligations when the call comes. Or overcount, to seem more formidable than they are. Getting accurate figures from Castilian grandees is like getting honest confession from a cardinal—theoretically possible, but requiring divine intervention.\"\n\nA thin smile.\n\n\"Still, it can be done. Here is what I suggest:\"\n\nHe ticks off points:\n\n\"First: Frame the request as preparation for a great crusade. The war against the Ottoman. Constantinople's defense. The nobles know you have committed to this—they have heard your speeches, seen the knights departing for the East. Tell them you must know Castile's full strength so that you may plan the greatest campaign since Granada. Appeal to their pride, their piety, their hunger for glory.\"\n\n\"Second: Send royal commissioners to verify the counts. Not to every estate—that would be seen as insulting—but announce that commissioners may visit to confirm the figures. The threat of verification produces more honesty than verification itself.\"\n\n\"Third: Make clear that the levy will not be called this year. You are planning, not summoning. Nobles fear immediate demands on their purses and their men. Assure them this is for the future—for the great war to come, not for tomorrow.\"\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\"Fourth: Offer something in return. Perhaps confirm existing privileges. Perhaps announce tax relief for those who demonstrate exceptional readiness. Perhaps hint at titles and honors for those who distinguish themselves in the coming campaigns. The nobility responds to incentives as surely as merchants do.\"\n\nHe sits back.\n\n\"Shall I draft the summons? And do you wish me to prepare estimates of what we should see? I have records, Your Majesty—old records, from your father's time and before. Tax rolls, previous levies, reports from the Military Orders. I can tell you roughly what each great house should be able to field. When their figures arrive, we will know who lies, and by how much.\"\n\nHe meets your eyes.\n\n\"What do you expect to find, Your Majesty? What number do you hope to see when all the counts are tallied?\"",

We will keep on doing this every year and we practice movement and unified order structure. I will distribute my officers who have been trained at the academy over these mustering places. I think about seven all over Castille are fine. That way they dont have to travel too far. When the war comes, I think I will only take 20000-25000 men with me. The best trained and equipped. We use these musterings to train and to prepare. And we keep on doing it every year from now on.\n\n\nFinally, - and this is where the real incentive comes in - I tell them that men committed to the muster count for the titles they can gain in the east. They remain my subjects, but they will also hold titles in the east. This means that a noble that contributes 100 men to the eventual campain, they might gain one or more estates. The system is already established. For reference,, for the title of grand doux (archduke) would require about 400 men to the campain. If more nobles contribute, the \"price\" will go up of course, but still. It is the easiest way to gain titles that exists.",

Training and standardized command structure\n5. Incentive: noble contributions to the muster = titles in the East (Constantinople/Romania)\n\nThe player also references the existing title system from Constantinople - the Taktikon of Romania which established Byzantine-style titles that can be granted to Latins who contribute to the defense of the East.\n\nI should have Álvaro respond to this thoughtfully - it's a significant reform that will:\n- Give the crown unprecedented knowledge of noble military strength\n- Create a standing training system\n- Tie noble ambition to Eastern expansion\n- Potentially reduce noble resistance to foreign campaigns\n\nBut there will also be concerns:\n- Some nobles may resist annual musters as intrusion\n- The title incentive may cause competition/jealousy\n- The crown is essentially building a more centralized military apparatus\n- Some may see this as reducing noble independence\n\nLet me have Álvaro engage with this carefully, noting both the brilliance and the potential friction points.\n\nI should also think about the d100 roll for how this is received by the Cortes.\n\nÁlvaro listens intently, and as you speak, his expression shifts from careful attention to something approaching admiration. By the time you finish, he is nodding slowly, a rare genuine smile crossing his features.\n\n\"Your Majesty has been thinking about this for some time,\" he observes. \"This is not a census. This is a reformation of how Castile makes war.\"\n\nHe rises and begins to pace—a habit when his mind is working quickly.\n\n\"Seven mustering points. Annual exercises. Crown officers commanding the drills, not noble retainers. Standardized structure.\" He ticks each point off. \"You are building something new, Your Majesty. Not the old feudal levy where each lord brings his men and commands them as he pleases, arriving when he wishes, equipped however he can afford. You are building...\"\n\nHe pauses, searching for the word.\n\n\"A royal army. One that answers to the crown's officers, trains to the crown's standards, moves according to the crown's orders.\" He turns to face you. \"The nobles will provide the men—but the men will be shaped by your academy, your marshals, your doctrine.\"\n\nHe returns to his seat, his expression thoughtful.\n\n\"And the title incentive is masterful. You are not demanding men—you are offering them the chance to buy something they cannot buy elsewhere. Land and titles in the East. A chance to found new dynasties, to become great lords in Romania while remaining your loyal subjects in Castile.\"\n\nHe strokes his chin.\n\n\"Let me be certain I understand the calculus. A minor hidalgo with twenty men-at-arms—he contributes them to the muster, trains with them each year, and when the great campaign comes, he marches east. If he survives, if he serves well, he gains... what? A small estate near Constantinople? A village in Thrace?\"\n\nHe leans forward.\n\n\"And a count who brings two hundred men—he might gain a substantial territory. A provincial governorship. Something his family could not have dreamed of in Castile, where all the great estates are already held.\"\n\nA pause.\n\n\"And a grandee who commits four hundred men or more—he becomes a Grand Doux. An archduke of Romania. Second only to... whom? The Emperor himself? To you, as Defensor Romaniae?\"\n\nHe sits back, fingers steepled.\n\n\"You are creating a new nobility, Your Majesty. A Castilian aristocracy of the East, bound to you by grants you control, holding titles in a hierarchy you have designed. The old nobility of Castile will remain—but beside them will rise new men, men who owe everything to your wars and your favor.\"\n\nHis eyes narrow slightly—not in disapproval, but in the calculation of consequences.\n\n\"Some will embrace this eagerly. The younger sons, the minor houses, the ambitious men with more courage than inheritance. For them, this is the opportunity of a lifetime.\"\n\n\"Others will be... warier. The great houses, the established grandees. They have lands already. Titles already. They may see this as dilution—new lords rising to challenge their primacy, new titles that cheapen the old ones. They may also fear what you are truly building: a military machine that answers to the crown, not to them.\"\n\nHe spreads his hands.\n\n\"I am not saying they will oppose you openly. They cannot—the cause is too pious, the incentive too clever, and your position too strong. But there will be quiet resistance. Undercounts. Excuses. Men who are somehow unavailable when the marshals arrive.\"\n\nHe pauses, then adds:\n\n\"There is also the question of the Church. The Military Orders have been your instrument for Constantinople thus far. If you create a parallel path to Eastern titles—one that does not require joining an Order—you may find the Masters... concerned. They have enjoyed being the sole gateway to crusading glory. You are opening other doors.\"\n\nHe rises again, moving to your desk where maps and documents are spread.\n\n\"Still—these are manageable problems. The vision is sound. More than sound—it is brilliant. You are preparing Castile for a war that is years away, and you are doing it in a way that makes the preparation itself serve your interests.\"\n\nHe turns back to you.\n\n\"For the Cortes, I suggest we present this in stages. First: the announcement of the great crusade to come. The war against the Ottoman, the defense of Constantinople, the glory that awaits. Let them cheer.\"\n\n\"Second: the mustering system. Frame it as preparation, not obligation. The realm must know its strength. The men must be ready. Annual exercises will ensure that when the call comes, Castile answers as one.\"\n\n\"Third: the title incentive. Announce the broad structure—contributions earn grants in the East—but leave the specific calculations vague for now. Let men come to you asking what they might earn. That puts you in the position of grantor, not supplicant.\"\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\"Shall I draft the proclamation? And shall we prepare a table—for your eyes only—showing what each level of contribution might earn? We should have consistency in what we offer, even if we do not announce it publicly.\"\n\nHe hesitates, then adds one more thought:\n\n\"The seven mustering points. Where do you envision them? The geography matters. Too far, and men will not come. Too few, and some regions feel neglected. I would suggest: Toledo for New Castile, Burgos for Old Castile, León for the northwest, Seville for Andalusia, Córdoba for Granada, Valladolid for the central plains, and perhaps Murcia for the southeast. But you know the realm better than any map.\"",

So I should set up the scene, describe who is present, the atmosphere, and then stop and wait for the player to deliver their speech.\n\nLet me set up:\n- The location (Toledo, likely the cathedral or a great hall)\n- The date (summer 1436)\n- Who is present (the three estates - nobles, clergy, cities)\n- The officers from the academy who have been introduced\n- The atmosphere and expectations\n- Then stop and let Juan speak\n\nSummer 1436, Toledo — The Cortes of Castile\n\nThe great hall of the Alcázar has been transformed. Banners hang from every pillar—the lions and castles of Castile, the arms of León, and prominently displayed, the new standard you have carried since Constantinople: the cross of the Defensor Romaniae, crimson on gold.\n\nThree estates fill the hall, arranged in the ancient manner.\n\nTo your right: the nobility. The grandees of Castile in their finest, chains of office glinting in the light from high windows. You see the familiar faces—the Count of Alba, the Duke of Medina Sidonia, the Marquess of Santillana. The Masters of the Military Orders sit among them: Rodrigo Manrique of Santiago, Luis de Guzmán of Calatrava, Gutierre de Sotomayor of Alcántara. Behind the great lords, the lesser nobility crowds the benches—the counts, the viscounts, the hidalgos who form the backbone of Castilian arms.\n\nTo your left: the clergy. Archbishop Gutierre of Toledo presides, resplendent in ecclesiastical purple. Bishops from every diocese, abbots from the great monasteries, representatives of the cathedral chapters. The Dominican delegation sits prominently—Fray Tomás de Torquemada's burning eyes fixed upon you from beneath his black hood.\n\nBefore you: the procuradores of the cities. Burgos, Toledo, León, Seville, Córdoba, Murcia, Valladolid, Segovia, Salamanca—eighteen cities with voice and vote, their representatives dressed in the sober wool of urban wealth. These are the men who control the servicios, the extraordinary taxes that fund wars and grand enterprises.\n\nYou have already conducted the formal business of the morning. Prayers were said. Grievances were heard—the usual complaints about tax collectors, disputes over grazing rights, petitions for privilege confirmation. You listened patiently, granted what could be granted, deferred what required study.\n\nThen came the introduction of your officers.\n\nSeven men now stand at the foot of the dais, arranged in a line. They are graduates of Sir Thomas Beaumont's academy—young, hard-faced, trained in the new arts of war. You called each by name, announced their assignment:\n\nDon Álvaro de Zúñiga — Marshal of Toledo\n\nDon Rodrigo Manrique the Younger — Marshal of Burgos\n\nDon Pedro de Ayala — Marshal of León\n\nDon Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba — Marshal of Seville\n\nDon Luis de Guzmán the Younger — Marshal of Córdoba\n\nDon Íñigo de Mendoza — Marshal of Valladolid\n\nDon Fernando de Bobadilla — Marshal of Murcia\n\nThe nobles watched this introduction with mixed expressions. Some nodded approvingly—these are their own sons and nephews, after all, honored with royal appointments. Others frowned, calculating what this new structure might mean for their own authority.\n\nNow the hall falls silent. The officers have taken their places along the wall. Álvaro de Luna stands at your right hand, his face carefully neutral. Diego de Daza waits with documents, ready to record whatever commitments are made.\n\nEvery eye turns to you.\n\nThe Cortes of 1436 awaits its king's word.\n\nWhat do you say?",

The nobles, the clergy and the burgers.\n\n\nAfter our great victory in Grenada, we have set our sights on an even bigger prize. Even bigger glory and even greater reward before our Lord. The Ottoman sultan awaits our blades.\n\n\nIt is an enemy like no other. No longer will we be the uncontested land power like we were against the Moors in Grenada. Make no mistake; while we can fiels 40.000 men on a good day and within or near our own borders, the Ottomans field 100.000. And they are better trained and equipped as well. How can we possibly defeat this foe?\n\n\nWe must step up and adapt. The old ways will simply not be enough. We need to move as one army, not just as a group of individual lords each commanding his own men, each with his own plan and idea about what the best battle plan is. We all know what happens when such an army meets the Ottomans in the field...disaster. We must not make the same mistake, but instead we must learn from it.\n\n\nThat is why from now on, we will have a local muster all through the kingdom to train but also count how many men are available to us who not only can fight, but are also willing to. Those who answer the muster, are properly armed, can fight, can follow orders and will answer the call to arms when we go to war will be counted in the muster count for land grants for after the war is over.\n\n\nThe more men you contribute, the bigger titles you can claim the moment we divide the land taken among our number.\n\n\nI show them the document from Constantinople explaining the principle.\n\n\nRight now, the Greeks contribute only a few thousand men to the war, not counting the militia. If we retake their old empire, any lord here can substantially increase his estates. Like we divided the Grenada lands among those who contributed to it, so will we do so in the east. Only the prize is much, much bigger.\n\n\nThere is a storm coming. A big one. We have to prepare. But I know that we will prevail. Everyone can see that Castille is building and growing from strength to strength. Think about where we are now. We are taming the wild african continent and are exploring new trade routes. We are building our domestic industries. We have already proven time and time again that no-one can stand against us in the field. My cousin has taken Naples and with my sister ruling in Aragon our easten alliance is stronger than ever. To our west, Portugal has merged it;s fleet with ours. While we will have fleet of our own in a few years that will dwarf theirs, their expertise and experience is muchg welcomed.\n\n\nWe are strong. And we will be stronger still for the war to come. No-one knows when it will start. But I know we will end it!\n\n\nI raise my fist. \nFor Castille!\n\n\nThis is a persuasion. Draft a d100 table.",

Religious framing - crusade against the infidel, glory before God\n3. The Eastern title incentive - concrete rewards for participation\n4. Strong position - kingdom is genuinely growing in strength\n5. Recent successes - African exploration, Portuguese alliance, Alfonso's Naples victory\n6. Practical framing - learning from others' disasters against the Ottomans\n7. The officers introduced are sons of the nobility - their own blood is involved\n8. Juan's personal credibility as a warrior-king who led from the front at Granada\n9. The system is voluntary in a sense - you contribute more, you gain more\n10. The document from Constantinople showing the established system\n\n**Failure Factors:**\n1. Loss of noble autonomy - their men will train under royal marshals, not their own command\n2. Fear of centralization - this is clearly a power grab by the crown\n3. The great houses have little to gain - they already have titles and lands\n4. Unknown timeline - \"no one knows when it will start\" creates uncertainty\n5. Distance - fighting in the East means leaving Castile, long campaigns far from home\n\n6. Cost - maintaining men for annual musters requires significant financial investment\n7. The Ottomans represent a genuinely intimidating military force with overwhelming numbers\n8. Practical doubts emerge about the feasibility of the proposed military reforms\n9. Military Orders might perceive the new system as a threat to their traditional crusading role\n10. Potential for high casualties looms large, with Juan himself acknowledging the Ottomans' formidable reputation\n\nThe speech strategically addresses potential resistance by candidly acknowledging the Ottoman threat while simultaneously appealing to noble pride and aspirations for martial glory.\n\nI'll craft a comprehensive strategy that balances concrete incentives with demonstrated military capability. The proposal offers tangible rewards while showcasing recent achievements, ultimately delivering a powerful motivational message that could overcome institutional skepticism. Centralization efforts will inevitably face pushback, but the strategic vision appears compelling enough to potentially overcome institutional inertia.\n\n**The Ask:**\nJuan is asking the Cortes to:\n1. Support a new military structure with annual musters\n2. Accept royal marshals overseeing training (loss of noble autonomy)\n3. Provide accurate counts of their military strength\n4. Commit to a future war against the Ottomans\n5. Accept the Eastern title incentive system\n\n**Juan's Approach Quality:**\nThe speech is quite good:\n- Honest about the challenge (Ottomans are formidable)\n- Appeals to religious duty (crusade)\n- Appeals to glory and reward\n- Provides concrete incentive (Eastern titles)\n- Shows strength (recent achievements)\n- Ends with a rallying cry\n- Doesn't demand immediate action—frames it as preparation\n- Introduced the officers first (who are sons of nobility)\n\n**Success Factors:**\n1. Juan's proven track record - Granada, Constantinople, Naples support\n2. Religious framing - crusade against infidel, pious cause\n3. Eastern title incentive - concrete rewards for contribution\n4. The officers are sons of the nobility - their own blood leads\n5. Strong kingdom position - Africa, Portugal alliance, economic growth\n6. Alfonso's Naples victory - shows alliance strength\n7. The system is presented as voluntary - contribute more, gain more\n8. Constantinople document shows established precedent\n9. Juan's personal credibility as warrior-king\n10. Framed as preparation, not immediate call to arms\n11. Three estates all benefit differently - nobles gain titles, clergy gain crusade, cities gain trade\n12. Juan's status as Defensor Romaniae - proven commitment to the cause\n13. Appeals to pride - \"no one can stand against us in the field\"\n\n**Failure Factors:**\n1. Loss of noble autonomy - men train under royal marshals, not their own command\n2. Centralization of military power - clear power grab by crown\n\n3. Great houses have minimal strategic advantage - existing Castilian titles limit motivation\n4. Uncertain campaign timeline breeds skepticism and hesitation\n5. Extreme geographical and combat risks - distant, terrifying Ottoman battlefield\n6. Acknowledged Ottoman military superiority creates existential doubt\n7. Economic burden of mandatory annual military preparations\n8. Potential disruption to established Military Orders' traditional power structures\n9. Underlying suspicion of crown's true intentions regarding military assessment\n10. Incomplete proposal details raise further concerns about transparency\n\nNobles fundamentally resist comprehensive military accounting. Their preference remains maintaining ambiguous strength levels, protecting current territorial advantages. The proposal triggers deep institutional resistance despite potential glory.\n\nThe initiative presents a nuanced political challenge. While conceptually appealing - crusade, potential titles, national prestige - practical implementation faces significant structural obstacles. Institutional inertia and self-preservation instincts will likely moderate enthusiastic response.\n\nPotential support exists, but compliance will depend on carefully negotiated terms. The Cortes might broadly endorse the concept while strategically limiting actual commitments.\n\nReaction spectrum ranges from tepid acceptance to genuine engagement, with roll outcomes determining precise institutional response. Key variables include perceived personal benefit, potential territorial expansion, and maintenance of existing power structures.\n\nThe marshal system represents a potential threat to established noble hierarchies, ensuring cautious, calculated participation rather than wholehearted embrace.\n\nPersuasion: Address to the Cortes of 1436\n\nThe Ask:\n\nJuan is requesting the Cortes to:\n\nSupport a fundamental reform of how Castile raises and trains armies\n\nAccept annual musters under royal marshals (loss of traditional noble command autonomy)\n\nProvide accurate counts of military strength to the crown\n\nCommit in principle to a future war against the Ottomans\n\nEmbrace the Eastern title incentive system\n\nApproach Quality Assessment:\n\nJuan's speech is well-crafted:\n\nHonest about the challenge — Does not minimize Ottoman strength; admits they field 100,000 better-trained men\n\nReligious framing — Crusade language, glory before God, the great cause\n\nConcrete incentive — Eastern titles tied to contribution; the more you give, the more you gain\n\nAppeals to pride — Recounts Castile's achievements: Granada, Constantinople, Africa, Portugal, Naples\n\nIntroduces officers first — Sons of the nobility, binding great families to the system\n\nFrames as preparation, not demand — No immediate call to arms; time to prepare\n\nShows the document — Precedent from Constantinople; this is real, not theoretical\n\nEnds with rallying cry — \"For Castile!\" — invites collective response\n\nSuccess Factors:\n\nProven track record — Granada conquered, Constantinople defended, Naples secured for Alfonso\n\nReligious legitimacy — Crusade against the infidel; the Pope supports Juan\n\nThe title incentive — Concrete path to gain lands and titles in the East\n\nOfficers are noble sons — The marshals are their own blood, not outsiders\n\nStrong kingdom position — Africa, Portugal alliance, economic growth, fleet building\n\nNo immediate obligation — This is preparation, not a levy call\n\nPrecedent established — Constantinople document shows the system already works\n\nJuan's personal credibility — Warrior-king who led at Granada, Defensor Romaniae\n\nAppeals to multiple estates — Nobles gain titles, clergy gain crusade, cities gain trade\n\nShared pride — \"No one can stand against us in the field\"\n\nFailure Factors:\n\nLoss of noble autonomy — Men will train under royal marshals, not their lords' command\n\nCentralization of power — This is clearly a crown power grab, however dressed up\n\nGreat houses gain little — They already have titles; Eastern lands are far and uncertain\n\nThe \"accurate count\" requirement — Nobles prefer ambiguity about their strength\n\nJuan admitted Ottoman superiority — 100,000 men, better trained, better equipped—this sounds suicidal\n\nUnknown timeline — \"No one knows when it will start\" creates uncertainty about commitment length\n\nCost of annual musters — Men, time, money for exercises that may never lead to war\n\nMilitary Orders threatened — New path to crusading glory bypasses their monopoly\n\nSuspicion of measurement — Some will think Juan is assessing who to weaken later\n\nDistance and danger — Fighting in the East means dying far from home\n\nFactor Balance:\n\nSuccess factors outweigh failure factors. Juan's track record is strong, the incentive is clever, and the framing is skillful. But significant resistance exists, particularly from:\n\nGreat houses who gain little from Eastern titles they don't need\n\nThose who fear centralization of military power\n\nThe Military Orders, whose role is being diluted\n\nNobles suspicious of the \"accurate count\" requirement\n\nThis is a \"yes, but with conditions\" situation. The Cortes will support the cause in principle—crusade is popular, and Juan is respected. The roll determines how enthusiastically they embrace the specifics, and whether the resistance is muted or vocal.\n\nd100 Table: Address to the Cortes\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-10\nCold Reception. The hall is silent after your speech. Polite applause, nothing more. The grandees exchange glances. When you call for responses, the Count of Benavente rises and asks pointed questions about \"ancient liberties\" and the traditional rights of lords to command their own men. Others murmur agreement. The Military Orders sit stone-faced. The procuradores look uncomfortable. The cause is endorsed in vague terms, but the specifics—the marshals, the musters, the counts—are \"taken under advisement.\" You have support in name only. The counts submitted will be unreliable. Resistance has not been defeated, merely driven underground.\n11-25\nTepid Support. The speech receives applause, but it is measured. The lesser nobility cheers; the great houses are restrained. When the marshals are presented, some nod approvingly at their own sons and nephews, but others frown at the implications. The Eastern title incentive draws interest, but also skepticism—\"fine words, but will these lands ever be ours?\" The Cortes endorses the general principle of preparation, but the details will require negotiation. Expect the counts to be underreported, the musters to be poorly attended in some regions, and the great houses to find reasons their men cannot participate fully. A foundation, but a shaky one.\n26-40\nSolid but Qualified Support. The hall responds well. The religious framing resonates; the list of achievements impresses. When you raise your fist and cry \"For Castile!\", most answer in kind. But in the conversations afterward, concerns emerge. The Duke of Medina Sidonia wants assurances about command structure in the East. The Count of Alba asks who decides which contributions earn which titles. The Military Orders request clarification of their role. Support is genuine but conditional. The system will work, but it will require ongoing attention to maintain noble buy-in.\n41-55\nStrong Support. The speech lands well. The honest acknowledgment of Ottoman strength, paradoxically, builds credibility—this is a king who does not lie to his subjects. The title incentive sparks genuine interest; you see nobles calculating what their contributions might earn. The marshals are accepted—grudgingly by some, but accepted. When the vote comes, the Cortes endorses the mustering system with only token opposition. The counts submitted will be mostly accurate. The annual exercises will be reasonably well-attended. You have built something real.\n56-70\nEnthusiastic Support. The hall erupts when you finish. \"For Castile!\" echoes from every corner. Nobles crowd around the marshals, asking questions, expressing eagerness. The younger sons and minor houses see opportunity; even some great lords express interest in Eastern titles that might elevate cadet branches of their families. The Military Orders, after a moment's hesitation, add their voices to the acclaim—they cannot be seen opposing a crusade. The Cortes endorses everything you asked for. The musters will be well-attended. The counts will be accurate. The foundation is solid.\n71-85\nResounding Success. The speech becomes a moment. The honest assessment of the challenge, followed by the confident listing of Castile's strengths, creates a narrative arc that carries the hall. When you show the Constantinople document, nobles lean forward to see. When you explain the title system, you see men already planning their contributions. The cry of \"For Castile!\" is taken up and repeated, again and again. The Cortes not only endorses your proposals but adds to them—the procuradores offer additional funding for the marshals; several nobles publicly announce their intended contributions. The Military Orders declare their full support. You have united the realm behind your vision.\n86-95\nTransformative Moment. This Cortes will be remembered. The speech strikes something deep—pride, faith, ambition, all woven together. Even the skeptics are carried along by the tide of enthusiasm. The great houses, seeing which way the wind blows, compete to demonstrate loyalty. The Count of Alba publicly pledges three hundred men; the Duke of Medina Sidonia matches him. The Military Orders announce they will coordinate fully with the new marshals. The procuradores vote additional funds without being asked. When you leave the hall, you hear men already speaking of \"the Cortes of the Crusade.\" The foundation is not merely laid—it is set in stone.\n96-100\nHistoric Achievement. The Cortes of 1436 enters the chronicles as a turning point. Your speech is copied and circulated; men who were not present claim they were. The unity achieved is unprecedented—nobles, clergy, and cities aligned behind a single vision. Contributions pour in beyond expectation. Even foreign observers take note; reports reach Rome, Naples, Constantinople, that Castile prepares for a great war with a unity of purpose not seen since the Reconquista. The musters become not merely exercises but celebrations of Castilian might. The marshals find eager volunteers. The counts submitted are not merely accurate but inflated—men want to be seen as greater contributors than they are. You have created something that will outlast this moment: a realm united for war.\n\nPlease roll d100.",

Expect the counts to be underreported, the musters to be poorly attended in some regions, and the great houses to find reasons their men cannot participate fully.\n\nI need to narrate this outcome, showing the failure factors persisting even as there is nominal support. The great houses are cautious, the Military Orders are stone-faced, there's polite but restrained applause. Juan has support in principle but not in practice - the foundation is shaky.\n\nResult: 15 — Tepid Support\n\nThe cry of \"For Castile!\" echoes back—but not from every throat.\n\nThe lesser nobility rises to its feet, young men with hungry eyes and empty purses, second sons who see in your words the chance their fathers' estates could never give them. Their voices are loud, their fists raised, their enthusiasm genuine.\n\nBut the front benches—where the grandees sit, where the power of Castile truly resides—remain more measured. The Duke of Medina Sidonia applauds politely, his weathered face unreadable. The Count of Alba nods slowly, but does not rise. The Count of Benavente's hands remain folded in his lap, his expression that of a man calculating costs.\n\nThe Military Orders are stone-faced. Rodrigo Manrique of Santiago claps twice, no more. Luis de Guzmán of Calatrava stares at you with an expression you cannot read—is it assessment? Concern? The Masters understand what you are building, perhaps better than anyone else in the hall. A path to crusading glory that does not run through their gates.\n\nThe clergy applauds appropriately—crusade is always endorsed, always blessed. But Archbishop Gutierre's smile does not reach his eyes. Fray Tomás de Torquemada watches with burning intensity, but his thoughts are elsewhere—on the Inquisition you have delayed, perhaps, or on whether this Ottoman war serves God's true purposes.\n\nThe procuradores of the cities respond well enough. Trade with Constantinople, African ventures, a growing fleet—these are things they understand, things that fill their coffers. They will vote for preparation. They will not resist.\n\nBut they are not the problem.\n\nAs the formal session concludes and men break into smaller conversations, Álvaro appears at your elbow.\n\n\"A foundation,\" he murmurs, \"but not a fortress.\"\n\nHe guides your attention subtly around the hall.\n\n\"The young men are with you—look at them, already clustering around the marshals, asking questions, imagining themselves lords of Eastern provinces.\" He pauses. \"But the old men... the men who actually control the levies...\"\n\nThe Duke of Medina Sidonia has gathered several other grandees in a corner. Their conversation is quiet, their expressions guarded. Occasionally one glances toward the dais where you stand.\n\n\"They are calculating,\" Álvaro continues. \"What does this new system mean for their authority? If their men train under royal marshals, answer to royal officers, learn royal doctrine... how long before those men think of themselves as the King's soldiers first and their lord's retainers second?\"\n\nHe shakes his head slightly.\n\n\"They will not oppose you openly. The cause is too popular, your position too strong. But the counts they submit will be... conservative. The men they send to musters will be the ones they can spare, not their best. And there will be reasons—always reasons—why this captain cannot attend, why that company must remain to guard the estates.\"\n\nThe Count of Benavente has detached himself from the grandees' cluster and approaches. He is old, wealthy, powerful—one of the pillars of the Castilian nobility. His bow is correct but shallow.\n\n\"Your Majesty's speech was most... inspiring.\" His tone is carefully neutral. \"The younger men are quite stirred. Eastern titles, lands beyond the sea—it captures the imagination.\"\n\nHe pauses, and when he continues, his voice carries the weight of a man choosing his words with precision.\n\n\"I wonder, though, about the practical arrangements. These annual musters—they require men to leave their fields, their duties, their families. The counts Your Majesty requests—they require... candor that some may find uncomfortable. And the marshals, fine young men though they are—they are young. Some of us have commanded men in the field when these officers were still at their mothers' breasts.\"\n\nHis smile is thin.\n\n\"I am certain these concerns can be addressed. But perhaps Your Majesty might consider a more... gradual implementation? Allow the system to prove itself before requiring the full participation you envision?\"\n\nBehind him, other grandees have drifted closer, listening without appearing to listen.\n\nThe Cortes has endorsed the principle of preparation. But the details—the teeth of the system—are being quietly resisted. The great houses will submit counts, but the numbers will be low. They will send men to musters, but not their best. They will praise the crusade in public and undermine the machinery in private.\n\nHow do you respond to the Count of Benavente?",

      "text": "Thought process: Orchestrated private council gathering to address noble grievances candidly.\n\nThe user wants to gather the Council of Great Houses - the voluntary noble cooperation body that was proposed by Don Íñigo López de Mendoza (head of House Mendoza) and accepted by Juan in late 1432. This council consists of the great noble houses who voluntarily audit themselves and cooperate with the crown.\n\nLet me set the scene properly. The Count of Benavente has raised concerns, and Juan is now inviting the grandees to a private meeting to hear their concerns. This is smart politics - taking the conversation out of the public Cortes and into a more intimate setting where the nobles can speak frankly.\n\nI should gather the key nobles from the Council of Great Houses and other major grandees. From my search results, the key houses include:\n- House of Mendoza (Don Íñigo López de Mendoza - founder of the Council)\n- House of Guzmán (Duke of Medina Sidonia)\n- House of Velasco\n- House of Enríquez (Admiral)\n- House of Pimentel (Count of Benavente - the one who just spoke)\n- House of Álvaro de Luna (obviously present)\n- House of Fernández de Córdoba\n- House of Zúñiga\n- House of Fajardo\n- House of Ponce de León\n\nThe Military Orders masters should probably also be present or at least some of them.\n\nThis is a good move by Juan - acknowledging their concerns and giving them a private forum to voice them. But I need to make sure the nobles voice real concerns and don't just roll over. The roll was a 15 - tepid support - so there are genuine issues here.\n\n\nÁlvaro nods, a flicker of approval in his eyes. \"Wise, Your Majesty. Let them speak freely, away from the lesser nobles who hang on their words.\"\n\n\nHe moves through the hall with practiced ease, touching elbows, murmuring invitations. Within minutes, a procession of Castile's most powerful men follows you through a side door into a smaller chamber—the same room where the Council of Great Houses has met before, its walls hung with tapestries depicting the siege of Algeciras.\n\n\n\nThe Private Chamber\n\n\nThe door closes. Guards take position outside. What remains is the true power of Castile, gathered in a room that suddenly feels small despite its grandeur.\n\n\nDon Íñigo López de Mendoza, founder of the Council of Great Houses, takes a seat near the window. His face is thoughtful, measured—he is the architect of noble cooperation with the crown, and he watches to see how his creation will weather this test.\n\n\nDon Juan de Guzmán, Duke of Medina Sidonia, stands near the cold fireplace, arms crossed. The wealthiest noble in Castile, his support carried Granada. His expression is unreadable.\n\n\nDon Pedro Fernández de Velasco, Count of Haro, represents the cautious old nobility of the north. He was hostile to Álvaro de Luna once; now he is... watchful.\n\n\nDon Fadrique Enríquez, Admiral of Castile, sits with the stillness of a man who commands fleets. The hereditary admiralty gives him stake in your naval ambitions, but also concerns about who truly controls the seas.\n\n\nDon Rodrigo Alfonso Pimentel, Count of Benavente—the man who challenged you in the hall—has followed, his thin smile suggesting satisfaction at being heard.\n\n\nDon Diego Fernández de Córdoba, head of the Córdoba branch, represents Andalusian power. His family's son is one of your new marshals.\n\n\nDon Pedro López de Ayala and Don Álvaro de Zúñiga complete the circle—lesser than the greatest, but still pillars of the realm.\n\n\nThe Masters of the Military Orders are notably absent—this is a meeting of the secular nobility, the Council of Great Houses and those who orbit it.\n\n\nÁlvaro de Luna stands at your shoulder, as always.\n\n\n\nDon Íñigo speaks first, as is his right as the Council's founder.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty honors us by seeking counsel rather than simply commanding.\" His voice is calm, diplomatic. \"We are your loyal servants, and we support the great cause you have proclaimed. The war against the Ottoman is just. The defense of Constantinople is noble. No man here would say otherwise.\"\n\n\nHe pauses, choosing his next words carefully.\n\n\n\"But the Count of Benavente has given voice to concerns that others share. Perhaps it would be best if each man spoke his mind plainly, here where no lesser ears can hear and twist our words.\"\n\n\nHe gestures to Benavente, yielding the floor.\n\n\nThe Count steps forward, emboldened by the private setting.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, I will be direct. The muster system you propose—annual exercises, royal marshals commanding the drills, accurate counts submitted to the crown—this is not merely preparation for war. It is a transformation of how power flows in this kingdom.\"\n\n\nHe raises a hand to forestall interruption.\n\n\n\"I do not say you intend tyranny. I have watched your reign. You have been... fairer than many feared, when you held all the cards after Granada. But intentions change. Kings die. Heirs inherit systems, not intentions.\"\n\n\nThe Duke of Medina Sidonia stirs. \"What Benavente means—what we all wonder—is this: if our men train under your marshals, answer to your officers, learn to think of themselves as soldiers of the crown rather than retainers of their lords... what remains of our authority? Today you ask us to count our strength. Tomorrow, perhaps, you decide some of us are too strong.\"\n\n\nDon Pedro de Velasco speaks, his northern accent thick. \"My family has held our lands for generations. We brought men to your grandfather's wars, your father's wars, your wars. We answered when called, fought when needed, bled when required. The old system worked, Your Majesty. Why change what works?\"\n\n\nThe Admiral, Fadrique Enríquez, adds quietly: \"And the Military Orders. They have been the path to crusading glory for a century. Now you offer another path—titles in the East for men who contribute to your musters. The Orders will see this as... competition. Dilution of their purpose.\"\n\n\nDon Íñigo raises a tempering hand. \"We are not refusing, Your Majesty. Let that be clear. The Council of Great Houses was founded on the principle that the great families and the crown can work together, each strengthening the other. We proved it with the tax audits—we policed ourselves, and the crown benefited without needing to coerce.\"\n\n\nHe meets your eyes.\n\n\n\"What we ask is this: how does your new system preserve that balance? How do we contribute to your great war without surrendering the authority that makes us great houses rather than merely wealthy servants? How do we know that the counts we submit honestly will not be used against us when the war is over—or never comes at all?\"\n\n\nThe room falls silent. Eight pairs of eyes rest upon you.\n\n\n\nThe great lords have spoken their concerns: fear of centralization, loss of traditional authority, suspicion of the crown's long-term intentions, and uncertainty about the Military Orders' role. They have not refused—but they have not truly agreed either.\n\n\nHow do you respond?",

But is is absolutely inadequate against the Ottomans. They laugh at us as muster before them, carrying a thousand flags and heraldries. They drink wine while we bicker in command tents that must include a dozen nobles who all demand input and to be included. Then our strategy is not a sound or bold plan, it is merely a political compromise. And on the battlefield, one noble might hesitate just a moment longer before before aiding a fellow christian who is also his rival back home.\n\nIf we are to fight the Ottomans, reforms like these are absolutely essential.

      "text": "Thought process: Analyzed noble reactions to military reform argument.\n\nJuan has made a powerful argument - essentially saying \"the old system worked against the Moors, but will get us killed against the Ottomans.\" He's being direct and honest about the military reality, and he's refused to go to war without reforms.\n\nThis is a strong argument because:\n1. It acknowledges their concerns without dismissing them\n2. It reframes the issue from \"power grab\" to \"survival necessity\"\n3. It puts the burden back on them - do they want to go to war unprepared?\n4. It shows Juan's integrity - he won't lead men to slaughter for glory\n\nThe nobles need to react. Let me think about how each would respond:\n\n**Don Íñigo de Mendoza** - He's the moderate, the bridge-builder. He founded the Council precisely to find cooperative solutions. He'll likely acknowledge Juan's point has merit.\n\n**Duke of Medina Sidonia** - Wealthy, powerful, pragmatic. He funded much of Granada. He's a realist - if Juan makes a compelling military case, he might be swayed, but he'll still want assurances.\n\n**Count of Benavente** - He's been the voice of opposition. He'll push back, but he needs to do so carefully. He might question whether the Ottoman threat is as dire as Juan claims, or whether Castile even needs to fight them.\n\n**Count of Haro (Velasco)** - Old guard, traditional. He'll be skeptical but not hostile. His concern is precedent.\n\n**Admiral Enríquez** - He commands the fleet. He actually has stake in naval expansion. He might be more sympathetic because he understands military coordination.\n\n**Don Diego de Córdoba** - His son is one of the marshals. He's in a complicated position - supporting the system supports his son, but he also has to represent family interests.\n\nThe key tension: Juan is essentially saying \"trust me or we all die.\" The nobles are saying \"we've heard that before from kings who wanted more power.\"\n\nLet me write a scene where several nobles react - some moved by Juan's argument, some still skeptical, creating a realistic division rather than unanimous agreement or refusal.\n\n\nThe silence that follows is heavy. You have not offered them reassurance or compromise—you have told them the truth, and the truth is uncomfortable.\n\n\nDon Fadrique Enríquez, the Admiral, speaks first. His voice is quiet, but it carries the weight of a man who has seen battle at sea, where coordination means survival and chaos means drowning.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty speaks of what I have seen with my own eyes.\" He steps forward slightly. \"At sea, a fleet that does not move as one is not a fleet—it is a collection of floating targets. I have read the reports from Varna. From Nicopolis. Christian armies that outnumbered the Turk, led by proud nobles who could not agree on when to charge, who attacked piecemeal, who watched their rivals die rather than risk their own men to save them.\"\n\n\nHe shakes his head slowly.\n\n\n\"The flower of Burgundian chivalry rode into Ottoman arrows because they would not wait for the Hungarian infantry. The King of Hungary fled while French knights were butchered because no one commanded all of them. These were not cowards or fools—they were brave men who died because bravery is not enough against an enemy who fights as one.\"\n\n\nThe Duke of Medina Sidonia uncrosses his arms. His expression has shifted—not to agreement, but to something more thoughtful.\n\n\n\"I was at Granada,\" he says slowly. \"I remember the command tents. I remember the arguments about who would assault which gate, who would have the honor of the first charge, whose banners would fly where.\" He pauses. \"We won anyway. But the Moors were broken, starving, divided among themselves. You are saying the Ottomans will not gift us such advantages.\"\n\n\n\"They will not,\" you confirm.\n\n\nDon Pedro de Velasco, the northern lord, frowns deeply. \"I do not doubt Your Majesty's assessment of the enemy. But I have a question that cuts to the heart of this.\" He steps forward, his weathered face troubled. \"You say you refuse to go to war without these reforms. Very well. But what if we cannot reform? What if the great houses cannot bring themselves to surrender command of their own men to royal marshals? Does that mean we simply... do not go?\"\n\n\nHe spreads his hands.\n\n\n\"Constantinople has stood for a thousand years. It may stand another hundred. Is this war truly so urgent that we must remake Castile itself to fight it? Or is there perhaps wisdom in waiting—building strength, yes, training men, yes—but not demanding that every lord submit his retainers to crown officers before the trumpet even sounds?\"\n\n\nThe Count of Benavente seizes on this thread. \"Velasco speaks my concern precisely. Your Majesty paints a picture of disaster if we fight the old way. But who says we must fight now? Who says we must fight at all?\" He raises a hand before you can respond. \"I am not saying abandon Constantinople—God forbid. But there are degrees of involvement. We have sent knights. We have sent gold. We have sent settlers. Must we send armies that require us to rebuild our entire military tradition?\"\n\n\nHe looks around at the other lords.\n\n\n\"The Ottomans are far away. The Moors were here, in our lands, threatening our homes. Every man in this room had reason to fight at Granada—our own estates, our own families, our own honor. But Constantinople?\" He shrugs. \"It is a noble cause. A Christian cause. But it is not our cause in the same way. How many of us will truly march to the other end of the world to die for Greek churches we have never seen?\"\n\n\nDon Íñigo de Mendoza has been listening carefully. Now he raises a hand, and the room quiets—his position as Council founder commands respect.\n\n\n\"I hear two questions tangled together,\" he says thoughtfully. \"The first is military: can we defeat the Ottomans with the old way of war? His Majesty says no, and the Admiral's words about Nicopolis and Varna suggest he is right. I am not a soldier, but I have read the chronicles. The evidence supports the King.\"\n\n\nHe turns to face you directly.\n\n\n\"The second question is political: if we accept these reforms for the Ottoman war, what happens after the war? What happens if the war never comes? What happens if it comes and we lose?\" He pauses. \"Your Majesty, you are asking us to trust that the power we surrender will not be used against us. You are asking us to believe that accurate counts and trained retainers and royal marshals are tools for victory abroad, not tools for control at home.\"\n\n\nHis eyes are sharp, probing.\n\n\n\"You founded the Council of Great Houses on a principle: that the crown and the nobility could work together, each checking the other, each strengthening the other. You did not demand we submit—you invited us to cooperate. And we did, because the invitation was genuine.\"\n\n\nHe gestures at the other lords.\n\n\n\"These men fear that the invitation has ended. That what was voluntary is becoming mandatory. That the Council which policed itself will now be policed by marshals who answer to you.\"\n\n\nDon Íñigo lets the words hang in the air.\n\n\n\"Convince us otherwise, Your Majesty. Not with arguments about Ottoman strength—we accept those. Convince us that when the war is won, or lost, or never comes, we will still be partners rather than subjects. Convince us that the counts we submit honestly will not become the chains that bind us.\"\n\n\n\nThe lords have revealed the true shape of their concern. They do not dispute the military necessity—the Admiral's testimony and the historical record have made that case. What they fear is the aftermath. They fear that emergency powers become permanent powers. They fear that cooperation becomes subordination.\n\n\nThey are asking you to guarantee something that, in truth, you may not be able to guarantee: that the power they cede for war will be returned in peace.\n\n\nHow do you respond?",

      "text": "Thought process: Analyzed persuasion mechanics and constructed nuanced response outcomes.\n\nThis is a persuasion attempt. Juan is trying to convince the great lords to support his muster system and the Ottoman war. Let me analyze this according to the persuasion skill.\n\n**The Ask:**\n- Support the muster system as voluntary, not mandatory\n- Accept that men counts can be traded/bought/sold\n- Accept the temporary nature of the reforms (reverting after war)\n- Commit to the Ottoman war in principle\n\n**Approach Quality Assessment:**\n\nJuan's approach has several strong elements:\n1. **Personal commitment** - He says he will go himself and die at Constantinople's gates if needed. This is powerful - a king willing to die for the cause.\n2. **Moral framing** - \"A cry for help if Christians remember who they are\" - appeals to their faith and identity\n3. **Voluntary framing** - \"I would not hold it against you if you do not support me. It should be a choice.\" - This removes the threat and makes it about honor\n4. **Face-saving** - Lords who don't contribute aren't punished, just don't get Eastern titles\n5. **Economic incentive** - Men counts can be bought and sold, creating a market\n6. **Temporary nature** - Explicitly states this reverts if war doesn't happen or after the war\n7. **Appeals to noble identity** - \"Fighting the infidel is what made the great houses great\"\n\nBut there are also some weaknesses:\n1. **Slight guilt-tripping** - \"You are comfortable and hold positions of privilege\" - could come across as shaming\n2. **Doesn't directly address the aftermath concern** - Íñigo asked for guarantees about what happens after the war. Juan says \"we revert\" but offers no mechanism to ensure this.\n3. **The bought/sold men counts** - This is novel and might raise eyebrows. It commodifies military service in a new way.\n4. **Still doesn't address command structure fears** - \"It is just the command structure that we are reforming\" - this IS what they're worried about\n \nKey persuasion dynamics reveal Juan's strategic approach. His pitch leverages multiple motivational levers: religious duty, personal honor, economic opportunity, and minimal risk. The voluntary nature and title incentives make participation attractive without feeling coercive. By positioning himself as a sacrificial leader and offering flexible military participation, Juan creates a compelling narrative that appeals to both pragmatic and idealistic noble sensibilities.\n\nThe proposal balances emotional and rational arguments. Religious zeal meets practical self-interest, with the temporary framing reducing perceived long-term commitment. Juan skillfully addresses potential resistance by emphasizing personal choice and noble identity.\n\nHowever, critical vulnerabilities remain. The lack of concrete enforcement mechanisms and unclear war termination criteria could undermine the entire proposal. Some nobles might perceive the approach as manipulative, potentially risking the entire recruitment strategy.\n\nThe outcome hinges on delicate perceptions. Lords will carefully weigh emotional resonance against potential systemic risks, with their response likely falling between reluctant compliance and cautious engagement.\n\n| Roll Range | Nuanced Interpretation |\n|------------|------------------------|\n| 11-25 | Pragmatic participation emerges. Most lords engage, but conservatively. They'll contribute minimal resources, watching peers' initial moves. No open resistance, yet no genuine enthusiasm. |\n| 26-40 | Fractured commitment surfaces. Some lords see opportunity through younger sons' potential advancement. The Great Houses display internal division. Regional participation becomes uneven - some areas enthusiastically muster, others perform perfunctory compliance. |\n| 41-55 | Honorable acquiescence takes hold. Lords respond meaningfully but without passion. They'll provide accurate troop counts and reasonable military commitment, motivated more by Juan's dignified request than genuine excitement. |\n| 56-70 | Substantive backing crystallizes. Juan's personal sacrifice deeply resonates. His willingness to risk everything transforms hesitation into genuine support, triggering more robust military contributions. The lords embrace the system, driven by Juan's compelling approach. Competition emerges instantly as houses vie to contribute. Despite potential reservations, the voluntary framework and Juan's leadership transform their perspective. Trust, economic incentives, and the crusade's appeal overcome initial hesitations, creating a powerful commitment mechanism.\n\n\nPersuasion: The Private Council of Great Houses\n\n\n\nThe Ask:\n\n\nJuan is requesting the great lords to:\n\n\nAccept the muster system as voluntary, not mandatory\n\nCommit to the Ottoman war as a choice, not an obligation\n\nTrust that the reforms are temporary and will revert after the war\n\nEmbrace the bought/sold men counts mechanism\n\nProvide genuine support rather than token compliance\n\n\n\nApproach Quality Assessment:\n\n\nJuan's approach has shifted significantly from the Cortes speech:\n\n\nStrengths:\n\n\nPersonal sacrifice — \"I will march east and die at the gates\" — A king willing to die for the cause carries immense weight\n\nVoluntary framing — \"I would not hold it against you\" — Removes coercion, transforms submission into choice\n\nAppeals to identity — \"Fighting the infidel is what made the great houses great\" — Links participation to what they already believe about themselves\n\nFace-saving — Non-participation is framed as comfort-seeking, not defiance; lords can choose honor\n\nEconomic innovation — Men counts can be bought/sold, creating flexibility and opportunity\n\nTemporary promise — Explicit commitment to revert if war doesn't happen or after it ends\n\nMoral clarity — \"A cry for help if Christians remember who they are\"\n\n\nWeaknesses:\n\n\nNo enforcement mechanism — The \"temporary\" promise is Juan's word, not a binding structure\n\nSlight guilt-tripping — \"You are comfortable and hold positions of privilege\" — Could feel manipulative\n\nCommand structure concern unresolved — Still says \"it is just the command structure we are reforming\" — this IS their worry\n\nÍñigo's specific question unanswered — He asked for guarantees; Juan offered trust\n\n\n\nSuccess Factors:\n\n\nJuan's proven track record — He has kept promises, treated nobles fairly after Granada\n\nThe Council of Great Houses exists — This is exactly the forum for voluntary cooperation\n\nReligious legitimacy — Crusade against infidels resonates with noble identity\n\nVoluntary framing removes threat — Choice is easier to accept than demand\n\nThe Admiral validated military necessity — Nicopolis and Varna prove the old way fails\n\nTitle incentives are real — Eastern lands are concrete rewards\n\nPersonal commitment — A king who will die for the cause commands respect\n\nThe bought/sold mechanism creates flexibility — Lords can participate at their comfort level\n\nJuan has never betrayed the Council's trust — The relationship is real\n\nAppeals to crusading heritage — What made them great can make them greater\n\n\n\nFailure Factors:\n\n\nNo guarantee mechanism — \"Revert after the war\" is just words\n\nThe command structure fear persists — Royal marshals still command their men\n\nGreat houses gain little — They already have titles and lands\n\nWho decides when the war ends? — Open-ended commitment with no exit clause\n\nConstantinople is far — Not their homes, not their families\n\nPrecedent concern — Today voluntary, tomorrow mandatory?\n\nThe bought/sold mechanism — Some may see this as degrading noble service\n\nTrust, once given, is hard to reclaim — If Juan dies, his heir inherits the system\n\nÍñigo's question was evaded, not answered — He will notice\n\nHonest counts still required — Information is power, and they're giving it away\n\n\n\nFactor Balance:\n\n\nThe voluntary framing dramatically improves the situation. Juan is no longer demanding submission—he is inviting participation. The personal commitment to die for the cause is emotionally powerful. The appeal to crusading identity resonates with who these men believe themselves to be.\n\n\nHowever, the core concern about guarantees remains unaddressed. Juan asks for trust but offers no mechanism. The great lords must decide whether Juan's character is sufficient assurance.\n\n\nThis is a \"lean positive, but with reservations\" situation. The emotional appeal is strong; the structural assurances are weak.\n\n\n\nd100 Table: Response of the Great Houses\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-10\nRespectful Distance. The lords are moved by Juan's passion—his willingness to die is noted, honored even. But the practical concerns remain unresolved. Don Íñigo observes quietly that Juan answered with emotion where he asked for structure. The voluntary framing is accepted: they will participate, but minimally. Counts will be low. Men sent to musters will be adequate, not excellent. The great houses hedge their bets, waiting to see if this crusade ever materializes. Support in principle; caution in practice.\n11-25\nCautious Acceptance. The speech lands, but incompletely. The younger lords are stirred; the older ones remain wary. Don Íñigo endorses the voluntary approach but notes—politely—that the question of guarantees was not answered. The Council agrees to participate, but conservatively. Counts will be accurate but not generous. The bought/sold mechanism is viewed skeptically by some, embraced by others. A foundation, but trust must still be earned through action.\n26-40\nDivided Council. The appeal splits the room. The Duke of Medina Sidonia, moved by the crusading rhetoric, commits publicly. The Count of Benavente remains skeptical, noting that passion is not policy. Don Íñigo works to find middle ground but cannot unify the Council. Participation will be uneven—some houses fully committed, others going through motions. The muster system will work in some regions, struggle in others.\n41-55\nGrudging Unity. The voluntary framing saves the day. Lords who would have resisted demands accept invitations. Juan's willingness to die for the cause earns respect, even from skeptics. The Council agrees to support the system—not enthusiastically, but genuinely. Counts will be reasonably accurate. Musters will be adequately attended. Don Íñigo notes that trust has been extended, and expresses hope it will be honored. The great houses are aboard, but watching carefully.\n56-70\nSolid Commitment. Juan's words land. The personal sacrifice, the appeal to identity, the respect shown by making it voluntary—it creates real buy-in. The Count of Benavente, disarmed by the lack of coercion, acknowledges that a king who asks rather than demands deserves a generous answer. The Council commits. Counts will be accurate. Musters will be well-attended. The bought/sold mechanism is accepted as practical innovation. Don Íñigo endorses the approach publicly.\n71-85\nStrong Endorsement. The room shifts. The Admiral speaks again of Nicopolis, of Christian knights dying because they could not coordinate. The Duke of Medina Sidonia pledges significant contribution. Don Íñigo rises and formally commits the Council of Great Houses to making the system work—not merely participating, but actively supporting. The voluntary framing is praised as worthy of a true king. Even Benavente nods, his concerns addressed if not erased. The great houses are genuinely aboard.\n86-95\nUnited Front. Juan's willingness to die transforms the conversation. These are men raised on crusading legends, and here is a king who embodies them. The voluntary framing allows them to choose honor rather than submit to demand—and they choose. Several lords announce intended contributions. The Council of Great Houses becomes an active partner. Don Íñigo pledges that the Council will help administer the system, ensuring both participation and accountability. The muster becomes not the crown's project but the nobility's shared endeavor.\n96-100\nTransformative Moment. The room falls silent after Juan finishes. Then Don Íñigo rises. \"Your Majesty asked us to trust you. You have earned that trust, and more.\" One by one, the great lords speak—not of concerns, but of contributions. The Count of Benavente, who began this conversation as chief skeptic, pledges his house to the cause. The bought/sold mechanism is embraced as opportunity. The Council votes to formalize their support in writing. When you leave this room, you have not merely their compliance but their commitment. The great houses are not just participating in your system—they are making it their own.\n\n\nNote: Even on high rolls (86+), the failure factors persist in reduced form. The lords support Juan because they trust him personally, not because they have structural guarantees. This trust is real but fragile—it can be damaged by future actions. The command structure concern is overcome, not erased. The temporary promise is accepted on faith, not contract.\n\n\n\nPlease roll d100.",

Let me craft the response accordingly.\n\nThe outcome should show:\n- The voluntary framing saves the situation\n- Lords accept invitations rather than resist demands\n- Juan's willingness to die earns respect\n- The Council agrees to support - not enthusiastically, but genuinely\n- Counts will be reasonably accurate\n- Musters will be adequately attended\n- Don Íñigo notes trust has been extended, hopes it will be honored\n- Great houses are aboard, but watching carefully\n\nI need to show the failure factors persisting - the concerns aren't erased, just overcome for now. The trust is conditional and watchful.\n\n\nResult: 41 — Grudging Unity\n\n\n\nThe silence stretches after your final words. You can see the lords processing—weighing passion against policy, weighing your willingness to die against their reluctance to cede authority.\n\n\nThe Admiral speaks first, his voice thoughtful. \"A king who would march east alone and die at the gates rather than lead unprepared men to slaughter...\" He shakes his head slowly. \"That is not the speech of a tyrant seeking power. That is the speech of a man who believes what he says.\"\n\n\nThe Duke of Medina Sidonia uncrosses his arms. His expression has shifted from guarded to something more complex—respect tinged with resignation.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty makes it a choice,\" he says. \"That matters. My grandfather served kings who made demands and called them invitations. You have done the opposite—made an invitation and refused to dress it as demand.\" He pauses. \"I will not pretend my concerns have vanished. But I will say this: House Guzmán will participate. Genuinely, not grudgingly. Our counts will be accurate. Our men will attend the musters.\"\n\n\nHe glances at the Count of Benavente.\n\n\n\"I cannot speak for others.\"\n\n\nBenavente's thin smile has faded. He looks older now, wearier. When he speaks, the challenge has left his voice.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty shames me,\" he says quietly. \"I came to this room prepared to resist. To protect my house's prerogatives. To find reasons why this new system threatened ancient liberties.\" He spreads his hands. \"And you tell me I am free to refuse. That you will not hold it against me. That you will march east without me if you must.\"\n\n\nHe exhales slowly.\n\n\n\"What am I to say to that? That I will let my king die at Constantinople's gates while I sit comfortable in my castle, counting my privileges?\" A bitter laugh. \"My sons would never forgive me. My ancestors would curse me from their graves.\"\n\n\nHe straightens.\n\n\n\"House Pimentel will participate. But I ask Your Majesty to remember this moment. You have asked us to trust you. We are trusting you. If that trust is betrayed—if these 'temporary' measures become permanent chains—there will be a reckoning. Not rebellion. But a reckoning.\"\n\n\nDon Pedro de Velasco, the northern lord, nods slowly. \"Benavente speaks for me as well. I remain... uneasy. The command structure concerns me. Royal marshals training men who have served House Velasco for generations—it sits wrong in my gut.\" He meets your eyes. \"But you are not demanding. You are asking. And you have earned the right to ask.\"\n\n\nHe sighs.\n\n\n\"House Velasco will participate. Cautiously. We will see how this first year proceeds before committing fully. But we will not sabotage or undermine.\"\n\n\n\nDon Íñigo de Mendoza has been watching this unfold with careful attention. Now he rises, and the room quiets.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty answered my question,\" he says slowly. \"Not with the guarantees I asked for—you offered no mechanism, no contract, no formal limitation on crown authority. You answered with something else: your character. Your willingness to die. Your respect for our choice.\"\n\n\nHe pauses, choosing his words with care.\n\n\n\"I will be honest. As a matter of policy, this troubles me. Kings die. Characters change. What one king offers as invitation, another may enforce as obligation. The history of Castile is littered with 'temporary' measures that became permanent fixtures.\"\n\n\nThe room tenses slightly.\n\n\n\"But.\" Don Íñigo raises a hand. \"The Council of Great Houses was founded on a principle: that the crown and nobility could work together in trust, each strengthening the other. Your Majesty has honored that principle today. You came to us privately. You heard our concerns. You responded not with threats but with appeals to our honor and our choice.\"\n\n\nHe looks around at the other lords.\n\n\n\"I propose this: the Council of Great Houses formally endorses His Majesty's muster system. We participate genuinely—accurate counts, good men at exercises, cooperation with the royal marshals. In exchange, we ask His Majesty to bring any changes to this system before the Council first, as he has done today. Not for our permission—we acknowledge the crown's authority—but for our counsel. So that trust, once extended, can be maintained.\"\n\n\nHe turns back to you.\n\n\n\"Is this acceptable, Your Majesty?\"\n\n\n\nThe other lords watch, waiting. Don Íñigo has threaded a needle—giving you their support while preserving the Council's role as a check on crown power. It is not everything you might have hoped for, but it is real. Genuine participation, not mere token compliance.\n\n\nThe bought/sold mechanism has not been discussed—some lords seem intrigued, others uncomfortable with the notion. That conversation will come later, in smaller groups, when the implications have been fully considered.\n\n\nThe Military Orders remain unaddressed—their concerns about competing pathways to crusading glory will need separate handling.\n\n\nBut the great houses are aboard. Watching carefully. Trust extended but not unlimited.\n\n\n\nHow do you respond to Don Íñigo's proposal?",

      "text": "Thought process: Identified military order leaders and their institutional concerns regarding competing crusade pathways.\n\nThe user wants to now address the Military Orders separately. Let me think about who the Grand Masters are and what their concerns would be.\n\nFrom my knowledge and the project files:\n- Order of Santiago: Rodrigo Manrique (Grand Master)\n- Order of Calatrava: Luis de Guzmán (Grand Master)\n- Order of Alcántara: Gutierre de Sotomayor (Grand Master)\n\nThe Military Orders have specific concerns that were raised during the Cortes:\n1. Juan is creating a new pathway to crusading glory that bypasses them\n2. The title incentive system competes with their traditional role as the gateway to holy war\n3. Their monopoly on organizing and leading crusading efforts is being diluted\n\nJuan has already reformed the Orders significantly - he got papal authority to appoint Masters (from the papal decree Fidei Defensio et Corona Triumphans, April 1433). So the Orders are already more under crown control than before.\n\nBut this new muster system with Eastern titles creates a parallel track. Previously, if a young noble wanted to earn glory fighting infidels, he joined an Order. Now he can contribute men to Juan's musters and earn titles in the East without ever taking vows.\n\nThis is a real threat to the Orders' relevance and recruiting power.\n\nLet me set the scene for this conversation.\n\n\nThe great lords disperse with murmured courtesies—some warmer than others, but all genuine enough. As they file out, you catch the arms of the three men who have remained deliberately apart throughout the conversation.\n\n\nRodrigo Manrique, Grand Master of Santiago, is a hard-faced veteran who earned his position through blood and service. His Order is the largest, the wealthiest, the most powerful of the three.\n\n\nLuis de Guzmán, Grand Master of Calatrava, carries himself with the quiet authority of a man who controls vast estates and the mercury mines of Almadén. A cousin of the Duke of Medina Sidonia, he bridges the worlds of secular and religious power.\n\n\nGutierre de Sotomayor, Grand Master of Alcántara, is the youngest of the three—ambitious, capable, still proving himself in a position he has held for only a few years.\n\n\nThey exchange glances as the last of the secular nobles departs. They know why you have kept them.\n\n\n\nA Smaller Chamber\n\n\nYou lead them to an adjacent room—more intimate, lit by afternoon sun through narrow windows. No servants. No scribes. Just the four of you, and Álvaro hovering near the door like a patient shadow.\n\n\nThe Masters arrange themselves with the unconscious hierarchy of men who have spent their lives in structured orders. Rodrigo Manrique takes the position of precedence; the others defer by fractions of distance and angle.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty wishes to speak with us separately,\" Manrique observes. His voice is neutral, but his eyes are sharp. \"We are honored. And... curious.\"\n\n\nLuis de Guzmán is more direct. \"The great houses have their concerns about command and authority. Ours are different.\" He folds his arms—unconsciously mirroring the Duke of Medina Sidonia's earlier posture. \"For a century, the Military Orders have been the sword of the Reconquista. The path to holy war ran through our gates. A man who wished to fight the infidel took our vows, wore our crosses, served under our banners.\"\n\n\nHe pauses, letting the weight of history settle.\n\n\n\"Now Your Majesty offers another path. Contribute men to the muster, earn titles in the East. No vows required. No service to an Order. Simply... buy your way to crusading glory with bodies and gold.\"\n\n\nGutierre de Sotomayor, younger and less diplomatic, speaks plainly. \"We have already given much for Constantinople, Your Majesty. Our knights garrison the walls. Our resources flow eastward. We answered when you called, as we always have.\" His jaw tightens. \"And now we wonder if our reward is to be made... obsolete.\"\n\n\nRodrigo Manrique raises a calming hand toward his younger colleague, but his eyes remain fixed on you.\n\n\n\"Sotomayor speaks bluntly, but he speaks truth. The Orders have questions, Your Majesty. We supported your reforms when you brought us under closer crown authority—we saw the wisdom in unified command. We have supported the Constantinople venture without complaint. But this new system...\"\n\n\nHe spreads his hands.\n\n\n\"What is the role of the Military Orders in the war you are building? Are we to be partners, as we were at Granada? Or are we to watch while secular lords purchase Eastern titles that once could only be earned through sacred vows and lifetimes of service?\"\n\n\nThe three Masters wait, united in their concern if not in their manner of expressing it.\n\n\n\nThe Military Orders fear obsolescence. They have been the traditional pathway to crusading glory, and you are creating an alternative. Their knights already garrison Constantinople; their resources already flow eastward. Now they wonder what place remains for them in your vision.\n\n\nHow do you respond?",

      "text": "Thought process: Weighed military order concerns against generous incentives and future opportunities.\n\nThe user is addressing the Military Orders' concerns about being made obsolete by the new muster system. Juan is reminding them of what he's already given them (expanded commanderies, 5000 florins annual gift to each order), promising future land grants like Granada, and pointing to opportunities beyond the Ottoman war - Africa and beyond.\n\nHe's asking if they understand his motivations, which is a softer approach than demanding agreement. Let me think about how each Grand Master would respond.\n\nThe Orders have legitimate concerns:\n1. They've been the traditional path to crusading glory\n2. Now there's an alternative path that doesn't require vows\n3. They're already contributing heavily to Constantinople\n\nBut Juan has also:\n1. Expanded their commanderies\n2. Given them annual gifts (5000 florins each)\n3. Promised them titles and lands from conquests\n4. Pointed to future opportunities in Africa\n\nThis isn't a persuasion roll situation - this is more of a conversation where Juan is explaining his position and asking for understanding. The Orders' concerns are real but Juan has been generous to them. They should acknowledge his points while perhaps still having some reservations.\n\nLet me write their responses in character:\n- Rodrigo Manrique (Santiago) - the senior, most political, will likely be the voice of reason\n- Luis de Guzmán (Calatrava) - more direct, connected to secular nobility\n- Gutierre de Sotomayor (Alcántara) - youngest, most blunt, might still have concerns\n\nI think they'll grudgingly accept Juan's explanation. He has been generous to them. The promise of African ventures is interesting - that's new territory for the Orders. The key is that Juan is framing this as \"more help, more spoils to share\" rather than \"the Orders are being replaced.\"\n\n\nThe three Masters exchange glances. Rodrigo Manrique's expression shifts slightly—the hard edge softening into something more thoughtful.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty speaks of what you have already done,\" he says slowly. \"And it is true. The commanderies have grown. The annual gifts are... generous. At Granada, the Orders received lands commensurate with our contribution.\" He inclines his head. \"Santiago does not forget this. We have been treated fairly—more than fairly.\"\n\n\nLuis de Guzmán unfolds his arms, his posture easing. \"I confess, Your Majesty, that in the hall—watching you present this new system—I saw only what the Orders might lose. The exclusive path to crusading honor, opened to any lord with men to spare.\" He pauses. \"I did not consider what we have gained these past years. Or what we might yet gain.\"\n\n\nHe strokes his chin.\n\n\n\"Africa, you say. And beyond.\" A flicker of something—ambition, perhaps, or vision—crosses his face. \"Calatrava has always been a land-based Order. Our fortresses guard the frontier, our knights patrol the meseta. But frontiers move. The Moors are gone from Castile. If the frontier moves to Africa...\"\n\n\nGutierre de Sotomayor, the youngest, has been listening with a furrowed brow. Now he speaks, his tone less sharp than before.\n\n\n\"I understand Your Majesty's motivations. Truly, I do.\" He spreads his hands. \"You need more men than the Orders can provide. The secular lords have retainers who might never take vows but would still fight for Christ and crown if given proper incentive. You are not replacing us—you are... supplementing us.\"\n\n\nHe hesitates.\n\n\n\"But understanding is not the same as comfort, Your Majesty. For a century, a man who wished to crusade knew the path: take the vows, serve the Order, earn glory through sacred commitment. Now there is another path—easier, requiring no vows, no lifetime of service. Just men and gold.\"\n\n\nRodrigo Manrique raises a hand, gently cutting off his younger colleague.\n\n\n\"What Sotomayor means—what we all feel, I think—is this: we understand why Your Majesty does this. We accept that you do this. But we ask for something in return.\"\n\n\nHe steps forward slightly, his voice taking on a more formal cadence.\n\n\n\"Let the Orders remain first among crusaders. Not in size—we cannot match the secular levies, nor should we try. But in honor. In precedence. When the army marches, let the Order banners lead. When the councils meet, let the Masters sit at Your Majesty's right hand. When the chronicles are written, let it be known that the Military Orders were the core of the host, around which the secular contributions gathered.\"\n\n\nHe meets your eyes.\n\n\n\"We do not ask to be the only path to crusading glory. We ask only to remain the highest path. The sacred commitment of an Order knight should mean something more than a lord's contribution of men and gold—however generous that contribution might be.\"\n\n\nLuis de Guzmán nods. \"And in practical terms: when titles are distributed in the East, let the Orders receive first choice of lands. Not the largest grants, necessarily—but the most significant. The strategic fortresses. The holy sites. The positions that require men who have sworn sacred vows to hold them unto death.\"\n\n\nGutierre de Sotomayor adds, quietly: \"And Africa. If Your Majesty truly envisions expansion beyond the Ottoman war—into Morocco, along the coast, wherever the cross might be carried—let the Orders be your vanguard there. New commanderies. New frontiers. A purpose that does not end when Constantinople is secured.\"\n\n\nThe three Masters stand together now, their earlier tension resolved into a unified position.\n\n\nRodrigo Manrique speaks for all of them:\n\n\n\"We understand your motivations, Your Majesty. We support your vision. We ask only that in building something new, you do not diminish what is old and sacred. Let the Orders retain their honor, and we will be your most faithful servants in whatever wars may come.\"\n\n\n\nThe Military Orders are not asking to block your reforms. They are asking for precedence, for first choice of strategic lands, and for a future role in African expansion. They want to remain the sacred core of crusading power, even as secular contributions grow around them.\n\n\nHow do you respond?",

He's assured them of their continued precedence and hinted at even greater opportunities ahead - the Holy Lands themselves, beyond Constantinople. The Masters seem satisfied.\n\nNow he's transitioning to casual conversation. I should narrate this briefly and then move the story forward. This is a natural ending point for this particular scene.\n\nLet me think about what happens next:\n- The Cortes of 1436 has concluded with tepid but genuine support\n- The Great Houses have grudgingly unified behind the muster system\n- The Military Orders have been reassured of their precedence\n- Juan is planning to visit Alfonso in Barcelona in spring 1437\n- Lucia is recovering from childbirth (baby Alfonso born late November 1436)\n- The African expedition is underway (we rolled 91, exceptional success, but that won't be known until 1439)\n- The foundry expansion rolled 23 (accumulating problems)\n\nI should wrap up the casual conversation and then ask what Juan wants to do next, or move time forward if appropriate.\n\n\nThe tension drains from the room like water through sand. Rodrigo Manrique's hard face creases into something approaching a smile—a rare sight, by all accounts.\n\n\n\"The Holy Lands,\" he murmurs, almost to himself. \"My grandfather spoke of them. His grandfather fought there, in the days before Saladin.\" He shakes his head slowly. \"I had thought those dreams dead. Buried with the last crusader kingdoms.\"\n\n\n\"Dreams have a way of rising from their graves,\" Luis de Guzmán observes. \"Especially when a king is foolish enough to believe in them.\"\n\n\nThere is warmth in the word foolish—the warmth of men who recognize a kindred spirit.\n\n\n\nThe conversation drifts to easier waters. Gutierre de Sotomayor mentions difficulties with a commandery in Extremadura—a dispute over grazing rights that has festered for years. You promise to have Álvaro look into it. Rodrigo Manrique speaks of a young knight in Santiago who shows exceptional promise, suggests he might be suitable for the Constantinople garrison. Luis de Guzmán complains, with the comfortable grumbling of old soldiers, about the quality of wine at this year's Cortes compared to the last.\n\n\nYou learn that Manrique's son is to be married in the spring—a match with a Portuguese noblewoman that will strengthen ties across the border. Guzmán's nephew has taken holy orders, much to the family's surprise; the young man apparently experienced a vision during the Granada campaign that turned him from sword to scripture. Sotomayor admits, after enough wine, that he has been corresponding with a widow in Salamanca and is considering remarriage despite the complications it might create for his position.\n\n\nThese are the small threads that bind men together—not grand speeches or formal agreements, but shared wine and honest conversation. By the time the Masters take their leave, something has shifted. They entered wary, suspicious, feeling their position threatened. They leave as partners in an enterprise larger than any of them.\n\n\n\nÁlvaro remains after they have gone, helping himself to the last of the wine.\n\n\n\"That could have gone worse,\" he observes dryly. \"The great houses are grudging but genuine.

Not a fortress—but a foundation.\"\n\n\nHe glances toward the window, where the afternoon light is fading toward evening.\n\n\n\"Lucia will be wondering where you are. The children have not seen their father all day.\" A rare soft note enters his voice. \"Young Alfonso is thriving, I hear. Strong lungs. The nurses say he screams like a future king.\"\n\n\nHe sets down his cup.\n\n\n\"What else requires your attention today, Your Majesty? Or shall we let the business of the realm rest until tomorrow?\"\n\n\n\nIt is late afternoon, summer 1436. The Cortes has concluded. The great houses and Military Orders have been addressed. Lucia and your children await. The muster system will begin taking shape in the months ahead.\n\n\nWhat would you do?",

      "text": "Thought process: Reconciled character genealogy and corrected naming error.\n\nThe user is correcting me - they don't have a son named Alfonso. Let me check what children Juan has:\n\nFrom the context and memories:\n- Fernando (son, age about 5-6 now in 1436, born around 1430/1431)\n- Catalina (daughter, born January 1432, so about 4 years old in 1436)\n- Bianca (daughter, mentioned in the Cortes speech)\n- And Lucia is pregnant or has recently given birth\n\nWait, I made an error. In my previous response about Henry's letter arriving in December 1436, I wrote:\n\"Lucia has delivered safely—a son, healthy and strong, born in late November. You have named him Alfonso, after your cousin—\"\n\nBut the user is saying they don't have a son called Alfonso. Let me re-check the character information.\n\nFrom the transcript summary:\n- \"Lucia newly pregnant (conceived late Feb, child due Nov/Dec 1436)\"\n\nSo Lucia was pregnant in early 1436, due to give birth in late 1436. I invented a son named Alfonso being born, but the user is saying they don't have a son called Alfonso.\n\nLet me reconsider what children Juan has:\n1. Fernando - son, heir, born to Isabel (first wife who died)\n2. Catalina - daughter, born January 1432 to Isabel\n3. Bianca - daughter (mentioned in the Cortes speech as one of Juan's children)\n4. The child Lucia was carrying (due Nov/Dec 1436) - we haven't determined the outcome yet\n\nSo I made an error by assuming the child was born and named Alfonso. The user is correcting this. I should acknowledge this and move forward.\n\nActually, looking back at my previous response about the Mali expedition results, I wrote: \"Lucia has delivered safely—a son, healthy and strong, born in late November. You have named him Alfonso...\"\n\nBut that was set in 1439, when I was narrating the Mali expedition results which happen over 1437-1439. \n\nI realize the timeline became muddled, mixing up different periods. Currently, it's summer 1436, and Lucia is still pregnant, with the child expected in late 1436. We don't know the child's gender or name yet. Juan's children at this point include Fernando, Catalina, and Bianca - a family in progress, with another potential addition on the way.\n\nI'm carefully tracking the family lineage: Fernando and Catalina are from his first wife Isabel, while Bianca is from Lucia. The upcoming child remains an unknown, adding an element of anticipation to Juan's family dynamics.\n\n\nYou are correct—I apologize for the error. Lucia's pregnancy was confirmed in late February 1436, with the child due in November/December 1436. The birth has not yet occurred, and no child named Alfonso exists. Let me correct and continue.\n\n\n\nEvening, Toledo — The Royal Apartments\n\n\nThe day's work is done. The great lords have departed to their lodgings, the Military Orders to their chapter houses, the procuradores to the inns and merchant homes where they are quartered. Tomorrow they will return to the Alcázar—but not for politics. Tomorrow is for the realm to see its future.\n\n\nYou find your family in the private apartments that have become home these past years. Lucia sits by the window, her hand resting on the swell of her belly—six months along now, the child quickening within her. The pregnancy has been easier than her first, the physicians say, though she tires more quickly in the summer heat.\n\n\nBianca, your youngest, plays on the carpet with wooden horses—a gift from the Duke of Medina Sidonia, exquisitely carved. At nearly two years old, she has her mother's dark Italian eyes and a temperament that shifts between sunny laughter and sudden storms of toddler fury.\n\n\nAnd there, seated at a small table with books spread before them, are the two who will face the Cortes tomorrow.\n\n\nCatalina, four years old, looks up as you enter. Her eyes—Isabel's eyes—are sharp, assessing. She has been practicing her letters with the tutor, and her slate shows careful, precise script far beyond her years. She does not smile at your entrance, but she watches, waiting to see what you want.\n\n\nFernando, your heir, rises immediately. At five and a half, he is already showing the magnificent physical presence the dice granted him—tall for his age, broad-shouldered, carrying himself with unconscious grace. But his eyes are soft, thoughtful, and the book he sets aside is a Latin primer that most boys his age could not begin to comprehend.\n\n\n\"Father,\" he says, and there is warmth in the word. Where Catalina observes, Fernando feels.\n\n\nLucia smiles at your entrance, though she does not rise—the pregnancy makes such movements uncomfortable now. \"The King of Castile returns from conquering his own nobility,\" she says lightly. \"Should I have wine brought, or have you had enough of lords and their endless cups?\"\n\n\n\nYou settle into a chair near the children, and Bianca immediately abandons her horses to toddle toward you, arms raised in the universal demand of toddlers everywhere. You lift her onto your knee, where she settles with a satisfied grunt.\n\n\nThe moment feels precious. Private. The masks of kingship set aside for an hour.\n\n\n\"Tomorrow,\" you begin, looking at Fernando and Catalina, \"something important is going to happen.\"\n\n\nCatalina's eyes narrow slightly—already calculating, already wondering what will be required of her.\n\n\nFernando simply watches you, patient, trusting.\n\n\n\nHow do you explain to your young children what the Cortes presentation will mean?",

At four, she already shows the brilliant, commanding nature the fates granted her—and the unsettling emptiness behind her eyes when the priests speak of God.\n\n\nFernando looks up from where he sits near his mother, a picture book open on his lap. At three, his magnificent physical frame is already evident, but his eyes are gentle, scholarly. He is the brilliant boy in a warrior's body who would rather read than fight.\n\n\nLucia smiles as you enter. \"The children have been asking when their father would return from his important meetings.\"\n\n\nFernando's face brightens.

I need to recall Catalina's traits from previous chapters:\n\nFrom the compacted conversation and my knowledge of the campaign:\n- Catalina: born January 1432, now ~4 years old\n- Brilliant (high intelligence roll)\n- Commanding personality\n- Excellent horsewoman (unusual for her age)\n- Notable trait: No faith/spiritual emptiness - when priests speak of God, there's an unsettling emptiness behind her eyes\n- Sharp, assessing eyes (Isabel's eyes)\n- Already shows deliberate grace and understanding of court rhythms\n- She \"observes\" rather than \"feels\" like Fernando does\n\nThis is a chaos roll about how a 4-year-old handles being presented to the Cortes - the assembled nobility, clergy, and city representatives of Castile. \n\nLet me think about the factors:\n\n**Favorable factors for Catalina:**\n- Brilliant mind - she understands more than typical 4-year-olds\n- Already grasps court behavior and rhythms\n- Commanding presence\n- She stated confidently \"I know how to behave\"\n- She has watched and absorbed court rules\n- Juan has prepared her and explained what to expect\n- Guards assigned for security and support\n- Dressed in finest clothes\n\n**Potential complications:**\n- She is still only 4 years old - children can be unpredictable\n- Her lack of faith might show if clergy engage her\n- Her commanding nature could come across as arrogant\n- She might be too cold/clinical in her responses\n- Some nobles might find her intensity unsettling for a child\n- She might say something too clever or cutting\n- She could become bored or impatient with the ceremony\n\nThis should be a chaos roll to see how she performs - with her traits factoring into the outcomes.\n\n\nChaos Roll: Catalina's Performance at the Cortes Presentation\n\n\nPrincess Catalina of Castile, four years old, is presented to the assembled estates of the realm. The nobles, clergy, and city representatives will form their first impressions of the King's eldest daughter—impressions that may linger for decades.\n\n\nCatalina's Known Traits:\n\n\nIntelligence: Brilliant (exceptional mind, absorbs knowledge rapidly)\n\nTemperament: Commanding (natural authority, confident, direct)\n\nSpecial Talent: Horsemanship (unusual for her age)\n\nPiety: Empty (unsettling absence of spiritual feeling)\n\nAlready understands court rhythms and behavior\n\nIsabel's sharp, assessing eyes\n\nStated with confidence: \"I know how to behave\"\n\n\nFavorable Factors:\n\n\nBrilliant mind allows her to read social situations\n\nCommanding presence creates natural impression of royalty\n\nShe has observed court behavior and absorbed its rules\n\nJuan prepared her specifically for this moment\n\nDressed in finest clothes, guards assigned\n\nOnly four—expectations are appropriately low\n\n\nRisk Factors:\n\n\nShe is still a small child; unpredictability remains\n\nHer intensity may unsettle some who expect childish warmth\n\nClergy may engage her on matters of faith—her emptiness could show\n\nHer commanding nature might read as arrogance in one so young\n\nShe might say something too clever, revealing a sharpness that discomfits\n\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-5\nDisaster. Something goes badly wrong. Perhaps a bishop engages her about prayer and her response reveals that hollow emptiness where faith should be—a chilling moment that starts whispers about the princess's soul. Perhaps she says something cutting to a noble who condescends to her, creating an enemy. Perhaps she simply breaks, overwhelmed by the crowd and expectations, and must be carried out weeping. Whatever occurs, the impression left is deeply troubling.\n6-15\nPoor Showing. Catalina is stiff, cold, too formal for a child her age. Nobles smile at her and receive flat stares in return. She answers questions correctly but without warmth, without the charm that makes adults forgive children their awkwardness. Some whisper that she is strange, unsettling. The clergy note that when blessed, she did not respond as children should. No disaster—but no favor earned either.\n16-30\nAdequate but Concerning. Catalina performs her role competently. She curtsies when required, answers questions politely, does not embarrass herself or her father. But something is... off. The nobles sense it without being able to name it. She is too controlled, too watchful, too adult behind those dark eyes. Some are impressed by her poise; others find it unnatural. Mixed impressions that will color future interactions.\n31-50\nCompetent Performance. Catalina does what was asked of her. She behaves properly, answers politely, shows appropriate deference to the great lords and clergy. She does not charm—that is not in her nature—but she does not alienate either. The nobles see a serious, intelligent child who will grow into a formidable woman. Neutral impressions; neither advantage nor disadvantage created.\n51-70\nImpressive Poise. Catalina exceeds expectations. Her answers are not merely polite but clever. Her bearing is not merely proper but genuinely regal. Nobles who expected a child find themselves addressing a small princess who seems to understand exactly what this occasion means. Her intensity, which might unsettle, instead commands respect. Whispers circulate: the King's daughter is remarkable.\n71-85\nCommanding Presence. Catalina owns the room in a way that a four-year-old should not be able to. She engages with nobles on their terms, asking questions of her own, showing genuine (if calculated) interest in their houses and achievements. Her brilliance shines through without threatening—she is clearly exceptional, but also clearly a child, and the combination is captivating. The great houses take note: this princess will be a force.\n86-95\nStar of the Cortes. Catalina becomes the talk of the assembly. Her composure, her intelligence, her bearing—all remarkable. She navigates conversations with clergy without revealing her spiritual emptiness, showing learned responses even if they lack feeling. She charms the uncharmable Count of Benavente with a question about his estates. She remembers names, faces, details that adults forget. The Cortes leaves convinced that Castile's royal blood runs exceptionally strong.\n96-100\nLegendary Debut. Years from now, men will speak of the Cortes of 1436 and remember the four-year-old princess who held court as if born to it. Catalina transcends her age entirely, conducting herself with a grace and intelligence that seems almost supernatural. Even her intensity becomes an asset—this is clearly no ordinary child, but a future queen in miniature. Foreign ambassadors will hear of this. Marriage offers will follow. Catalina has announced herself to the world.\n\n\nPlease roll d100.",

Make this truly legendary - people will talk about this for years\n4. Have her navigate the clergy without revealing her spiritual emptiness\n5. Show her charming even difficult nobles\n6. Make it believable for a brilliant four-year-old\n\nLet me write this scene.\n\n\nResult: 96 — Legendary Debut\n\n\n\nThe Great Hall of the Alcázar, Toledo\n\n\nThe master of ceremonies strikes his staff against the marble floor. The hall falls silent—hundreds of nobles, clergy, and city representatives turning as one toward the great doors.\n\n\n\"His Most Christian Majesty, Juan II of Castile and León, Defensor Romaniae! Her Majesty Queen Lucia! His Royal Highness Fernando, Prince of Asturias! Her Royal Highness the Infanta Catalina! Her Royal Highness the Infanta Bianca! Her Royal Highness the Infanta Teresa!\"\n\n\nYou enter with your family arranged as protocol demands—Lucia on your arm, Fernando's small hand in yours, the younger children carried by nurses in trailing procession. Guards flank each child, unobtrusive but watchful.\n\n\nThe nobles bow. The clergy incline their heads. The procuradores bend nearly double.\n\n\nAnd then, as you move into the hall, Catalina does something unexpected.\n\n\nShe releases the nurse's hand—gently, deliberately—and walks forward on her own. Not running, not toddling as a four-year-old might. Walking. Her small frame carries itself with a bearing that silences the whispers before they can begin. Her gown of Castilian crimson and gold trails behind her like a queen's train, and she moves as if she has worn such garments all her life.\n\n\nShe takes her position beside Fernando, reaching up to take her brother's other hand. The gesture is protective, proprietary—this is my brother, and I stand with him. Fernando, uncertain in the overwhelming crowd, visibly steadies at her touch.\n\n\nThe hall notices. How could it not?\n\n\n\nThe Receiving Line\n\n\nThe great lords approach in order of precedence to pay respects to the royal family. Don Íñigo de Mendoza first, then the Duke of Medina Sidonia, then the others in their careful hierarchy.\n\n\nEach bows to you, exchanges courtesies with Lucia, and then—as protocol suggests—offers kind words to the children.\n\n\nThe Duke of Medina Sidonia bends his great frame down toward Catalina, smiling the indulgent smile that powerful men offer to small children.\n\n\n\"And how does the little princess find the Cortes? Is it not overwhelming, all these serious men in their serious clothes?\"\n\n\nCatalina regards him with Isabel's eyes—sharp, measuring.\n\n\n\"Your Grace conquered Jimena de la Frontera,\" she says. Her voice is clear, carrying further than a four-year-old's voice should. \"Father says your cavalry broke the Moorish line when others would not advance.\"\n\n\nThe Duke's smile freezes, then transforms into something genuine. He glances up at you, eyebrows raised.\n\n\n\"My father tells me of the great lords,\" Catalina continues, \"so that I will know them when I meet them. House Guzmán has served Castile for two hundred years. I am honored to meet its head.\"\n\n\nThe Duke of Medina Sidonia—who has weathered battles, sieges, and the treacherous politics of three reigns—bows to a four-year-old girl as if she were already a queen.\n\n\n\"The honor,\" he says, and there is no condescension now, \"is entirely mine, Your Highness.\"\n\n\n\nThe Count of Benavente\n\n\nThe man who challenged you in the Cortes approaches with visible wariness. His concerns about crown power are well-known; his relationship with the throne is cordial but careful. He bows correctly, exchanges the required pleasantries with you and Lucia, and turns to the children with the expression of a man performing a duty.\n\n\n\"Your Highnesses,\" he says to Fernando and Catalina together. \"A pleasure.\"\n\n\nFernando murmurs something polite but nearly inaudible, overwhelmed by the crowd. Catalina steps slightly forward, drawing the Count's attention.\n\n\n\"Count of Benavente,\" she says. \"Your house holds the fortress of Benavente on the river Órbigo. My tutor says it has never fallen to siege.\"\n\n\nBenavente blinks. \"That... is correct, Your Highness.\"\n\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\nThe question is asked with genuine curiosity—or what appears to be genuine curiosity. With Catalina, it is difficult to tell where calculation ends and authentic interest begins.\n\n\nThe Count finds himself explaining medieval fortification principles to a four-year-old princess while a line of grandees waits behind him. He speaks of walls and rivers and killing grounds, and Catalina listens with an intensity that would be unsettling if it were not so flattering.\n\n\nWhen he finishes, she nods seriously. \"I should like to see it someday. A fortress that has never fallen must be worth seeing.\"\n\n\nThe Count of Benavente—skeptic, critic, the voice of noble concern—finds himself promising a royal visit to his ancestral seat. He walks away looking faintly stunned, as if unsure what just happened.\n\n\n\nThe Clergy\n\n\nArchbishop Gutierre of Toledo approaches with his retinue of bishops. This is the moment of greatest risk—Catalina's spiritual emptiness lies beneath her polished surface like a crack in fine porcelain.\n\n\nThe Archbishop bends to bless the children, making the sign of the cross over each small head. Fernando receives it with genuine solemnity, his sincere faith evident in his stillness. Bianca, in her nurse's arms, giggles and reaches for the Archbishop's glittering pectoral cross.\n\n\nCatalina bows her head at precisely the correct angle, holds perfectly still for precisely the correct duration, and murmurs responses that are doctrinally flawless.\n\n\n\"The princess knows her catechism,\" the Archbishop observes, pleased.\n\n\n\"I practice every day, Your Eminence,\" Catalina replies. \"Father Alejandro says that faith is like a muscle—it must be exercised to grow strong.\"\n\n\nThe Archbishop beams. It is exactly what a pious child should say. He does not see—cannot see—that the words are performance, perfectly memorized and perfectly empty. Catalina has learned what is expected, and she delivers it with the same precision she brings to everything.\n\n\nOnly Fray Tomás de Torquemada, watching from among the Dominican delegation, tilts his head slightly. His burning eyes rest on Catalina for a long moment. But whatever he sees—or thinks he sees—he keeps to himself.\n\n\n\nThe Whispers Begin\n\n\nBy midday, the presentation has transformed into something else entirely. Nobles who have paid their respects to you linger in clusters, and the name on every lip is not Juan, not Lucia, not even Fernando.\n\n\nIt is Catalina.\n\n\n\"Did you hear what she said to Medina Sidonia? She knew his battle history. She is four.\"\n\n\n\"Benavente looked like he'd been struck by lightning. She had him explaining siege warfare to her like a student before a master.\"\n\n\n\"The poise. The bearing. I have seen grown women with less presence.\"\n\n\n\"Mark my words—whoever marries that girl will find he has wed a queen, not merely a princess.\"\n\n\nThe Count of Alba approaches you during a quiet moment, his weathered face creased with something approaching wonder.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" he says, \"I have served three kings. I have seen royal children presented to Cortes a dozen times. I have never seen anything like your daughter.\"\n\n\nHe shakes his head.\n\n\n\"Guard her well. A mind like that, in a woman's body, will make her either the greatest asset your house has ever possessed—or a danger beyond reckoning. There is no middle ground for one such as her.\"\n\n\n\nEvening — The Private Apartments\n\n\nThe day is done. The Cortes has concluded its formal business. The nobles have departed to discuss what they witnessed over wine and speculation.\n\n\nYou return to the private apartments with your family. Teresa sleeps in her nurse's arms. Bianca is cranky from exhaustion and overstimulation. Fernando is quiet, drained by the overwhelming attention, seeking comfort in his mother's presence.\n\n\nAnd Catalina sits by the window, looking out at the darkening city, her small face unreadable.\n\n\nShe performed flawlessly. She charmed the uncharmable. She navigated clergy without revealing her secret emptiness. She announced herself to the realm as a force to be reckoned with.\n\n\nAnd she is four years old.\n\n\nLucia catches your eye across the room. Her expression holds pride, certainly—but also something else. Something that might be concern.\n\n\nYour daughter is remarkable. The Count of Alba's words echo: the greatest asset your house has ever possessed—or a danger beyond reckoning.\n\n\nCatalina continues to gaze out the window, her thoughts hidden behind those dark, ancient eyes.\n\n\n\nThe Cortes of 1436 will be remembered. And when men speak of it in years to come, they will speak of the four-year-old princess who held court like a queen.\n\n\nFernando's presentation remains to be resolved.

      "text": "Thought process: Synthesized Fernando's traits to construct performance table framework.\n\nThe user wants me to draft a d100 table for Fernando's performance at the Cortes presentation, similar to what I did for Catalina. Let me recall Fernando's traits:\n\nFrom the earlier rolls in Chapter 2.40:\n- Intelligence: 82 (Brilliant) - Exceptional mind, learns languages effortlessly\n- Temperament: 64 (Bold) - Confident, decisive, direct\n- Martial Aptitude: 9 (Reluctant) - Does NOT take to arms, prefers books to blades\n- Special Talent: 76 (Languages) - Extraordinary linguistic gift\n- Piety: 50 (Sincere) - Genuine quiet faith\n- Physical Presence: 87 (Magnificent) - Tall, broad-shouldered, looks like a warrior-king\n\nSo Fernando is a brilliant scholar-prince who looks every inch the crusader but would rather negotiate than fight. He has sincere faith, a magnificent physical presence, and is bold/confident. He's about 3 years old.\n\nKey considerations for the table:\n- He's only 3, so expectations are even lower than for Catalina\n- He was described as overwhelmed by the crowd, seeking comfort\n- Catalina took his hand and he steadied at her touch\n- He has sincere faith (unlike Catalina's emptiness)\n- He's brilliant but gentle/scholarly\n- His magnificent physical presence means he looks impressive\n- He's bold/confident normally, but crowds might overwhelm him at 3\n- He murmured something polite but nearly inaudible during the Benavente interaction\n\nThe challenge: Fernando is younger (3 vs 4), and was shown as more overwhelmed. But he has sincere piety (which will help with clergy), magnificent physical presence (impressive to nobles), and bold temperament (might shine through). His brilliance and language talent might show.\n\nI should make a table that reflects:\n- Higher risk of being overwhelmed (he's younger, shown as uncertain)\n\n\n- His physical magnificence could create an initial powerful impression\n- Clergy might respond positively to his genuine faith\n- Warrior nobles could misinterpret his scholarly gentleness as weakness\n- His innate boldness might emerge once he feels secure\n- Catalina's performance creates both competitive pressure and protective context\n\n\nChaos Roll: Fernando's Performance at the Cortes Presentation\n\n\nPrince Fernando of Castile, heir to the throne, three years old, is presented to the assembled estates of the realm. As Prince of Asturias, he is the future of the dynasty—the nobles will scrutinize him closely, forming impressions that may shape their loyalty for decades to come.\n\n\nFernando's Known Traits:\n\n\nIntelligence: Brilliant (exceptional mind, absorbs knowledge rapidly)\n\nTemperament: Bold (confident, decisive, direct—though young)\n\nMartial Aptitude: Reluctant (prefers books to blades, violence unsettles him)\n\nSpecial Talent: Languages (extraordinary linguistic gift)\n\nPiety: Sincere (genuine quiet faith, comforting to Juan)\n\nPhysical Presence: Magnificent (already tall, broad-shouldered, looks like a future warrior-king)\n\nGentle, warm nature—seeks approval, wants to please\n\n\nFavorable Factors:\n\n\nMagnificent physical presence creates immediate impression of royalty\n\nBrilliant mind allows him to absorb and respond to situations\n\nBold temperament may emerge once initial overwhelm passes\n\nSincere piety will resonate genuinely with clergy\n\nOnly three—expectations are very low\n\nCatalina's presence steadies him (she took his hand)\n\nJuan prepared him specifically for this moment\n\nDressed in finest clothes, guards assigned\n\n\nRisk Factors:\n\n\nHe is only three—very young even by royal presentation standards\n\nAlready shown as overwhelmed by the crowd, murmuring nearly inaudibly\n\nHis gentle, scholarly nature may read as weakness to warrior nobles\n\nHis reluctance toward martial matters may show if pressed\n\nCatalina's legendary performance creates an impossible shadow\n\nNobles expecting a warrior-prince may be disappointed by his softness\n\nHis brilliance is less showy than Catalina's—more internal, less performative\n\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-5\nDisaster. The crowd overwhelms him entirely. Perhaps he bursts into tears and must be carried out. Perhaps he clings to Lucia and refuses to engage. Perhaps a well-meaning noble presses him about swords and fighting and Fernando's visible distress reveals his reluctant nature in the worst possible light. Whispers begin immediately: the heir is weak, timid, unfit. Catalina's brilliance makes his failure all the more stark. A shadow falls over the succession.\n6-15\nPoor Showing. Fernando endures but does not shine. He mumbles responses, avoids eye contact, shrinks from the attention. His magnificent frame seems wasted on a boy so obviously uncomfortable. Nobles who expected a bold young prince find a timid child hiding behind his sister. The clergy note his genuine piety, which saves him from complete failure—but the warrior nobility exchange concerned glances. The heir seems... soft.\n16-30\nOvershadowed. Fernando performs adequately, but Catalina's extraordinary debut makes adequacy seem like failure. He answers when spoken to, behaves properly, does not embarrass himself—but every interaction reminds onlookers of his sister's brilliance. Nobles note his impressive physical bearing but wonder if there is substance behind it. Mixed impressions: he looks the part, but does he have the spirit? Questions linger.\n31-50\nAcceptable Performance. Fernando does what a three-year-old prince should do. He stands when required, bows to the great lords, receives blessings with evident sincerity. His shyness reads as appropriate childhood reserve rather than weakness. His physical magnificence draws admiring comments. He does not dazzle—but he does not disappoint. The realm sees a young prince who may yet grow into his role. Neutral impressions; potential noted but unproven.\n51-70\nQuiet Dignity. Fernando finds his footing as the day progresses. His initial overwhelm fades, replaced by the bold confidence that is his true nature. He does not perform as Catalina does—he lacks her cutting brilliance and commanding presence—but he offers something else: warmth. His genuine smile charms where her intensity commands. His sincere responses to clergy impress where her perfection felt rehearsed. Nobles see a different kind of prince—gentler, perhaps, but no less worthy.\n71-85\nComplementary Strengths. Fernando emerges from his sister's shadow not by matching her, but by offering contrast. Where she commands, he connects. Where she dazzles with intellect, he touches with authenticity. A bishop engages him about prayer, and his sincere, unpolished faith moves the old man nearly to tears. A gruff military lord speaks to him of horses, and Fernando's genuine interest—unthreatening, curious—wins the man over. The realm sees two remarkable children, each extraordinary in different ways.\n86-95\nThe Prince Emerges. Fernando's bold temperament finally surfaces, transforming initial timidity into something more impressive: a young prince who observes before he acts, who thinks before he speaks. His responses, when they come, show surprising depth. His physical magnificence is matched by flashes of the brilliant mind within. A moment of genuine connection with a common-born procurador shows a prince who sees beyond rank. The clergy are moved by his authentic piety. Nobles revise their expectations upward: this boy will be a worthy king.\n96-100\nFuture King Revealed. Something happens—a moment, an exchange, a flash of the man the boy will become—that silences all doubt. Perhaps a great lord tests him with a difficult question and Fernando's answer shows wisdom beyond his years. Perhaps his genuine kindness to a lesser noble moves the room. Perhaps he says something to the clergy that rings with true, unforced holiness. Whatever occurs, the realm glimpses not just a promising child but a future sovereign. Catalina may have dazzled, but Fernando—gentle, brilliant, magnificent—has inspired. Where she commands loyalty, he earns love.\n\n\nNote: Fernando's success looks different from Catalina's. She conquers through command and intellect; he wins through authenticity and warmth. Even at the highest rolls, his gentle nature remains—it becomes a strength rather than a weakness, but it does not disappear. The reluctant warrior becomes the wise king, not the fierce one.\n\n\n\nPlease roll d100.",

      "text": "Thought process: Orchestrated adequate performance narrative contrasting with exceptional sibling.\n\nThe user rolled 35, which falls into the 31-50 range: \"Acceptable Performance.\"\n\nLet me write out what happens with Fernando at the Cortes presentation. He's three years old, and he performs adequately - not brilliantly like his sister, but not poorly either. He does what's expected of a three-year-old prince. His physical magnificence is noted, his shyness reads as appropriate childhood reserve, and his sincere piety is evident. Neutral impressions - potential noted but unproven.\n\nI need to narrate this in a way that:\n1. Shows Fernando doing adequately but not brilliantly\n2. Contrasts with Catalina's legendary performance (roll 96)\n3. Shows his genuine piety and warmth\n4. Shows his physical magnificence being noted\n5. Shows his initial overwhelm and shyness\n6. Ends without generating dialogue or actions for Juan\n\nLet me write this scene.\n\n\nResult: 35 — Acceptable Performance\n\n\n\nThe Great Hall of the Alcázar\n\n\nWhere Catalina commanded, Fernando endures.\n\n\nIt is not failure—far from it. He stands where he should stand, bows when he should bow, responds when addressed. His small hand remains in yours for much of the morning, drawing comfort from your presence, and when the great lords bend to speak with him, he meets their eyes with the effort of a child who has been told this matters.\n\n\nBut he is three years old. And three-year-olds, however brilliant, however magnificent in frame, are still three.\n\n\n\nThe Duke of Medina Sidonia\n\n\nThe Duke, still visibly affected by his encounter with Catalina, turns to Fernando with renewed interest. Perhaps lightning will strike twice.\n\n\n\"And the young prince,\" he says warmly. \"The future of Castile. Tell me, Your Highness—do you like horses? Swords? The things a prince should love?\"\n\n\nFernando looks up at the great lord—this massive, armored figure who conquered Jimena and broke Moorish lines—and something flickers across his face. Uncertainty. Discomfort.\n\n\n\"I like horses,\" he says quietly. It is true; he does like horses, though more for their beauty than for their use in war. \"Father is teaching me to ride.\"\n\n\n\"Excellent! And swords? Every prince must learn the blade.\"\n\n\nA pause. Fernando's magnificent shoulders seem to draw inward slightly.\n\n\n\"I am learning,\" he says. The words are correct. The enthusiasm is absent.\n\n\nThe Duke nods, smiles, moves on. His expression betrays nothing—but you notice that he does not look back at Fernando the way he looked back at Catalina.\n\n\n\nThe Clergy\n\n\nHere, Fernando finds surer footing.\n\n\nArchbishop Gutierre bends to bless him, and where Catalina performed piety with technical perfection, Fernando receives the blessing. His eyes close. His small body stills. When he murmurs \"Amen,\" the word carries weight.\n\n\nThe Archbishop pauses, studying the boy's face.\n\n\n\"The young prince has a devout heart,\" he observes to you. \"That is rarer than you might think, even among the children of kings.\"\n\n\nFray Tomás de Torquemada, who watched Catalina with unsettling attention, looks at Fernando differently. There is approval in those burning eyes—recognition of something genuine where, perhaps, he sensed something hollow in the sister.\n\n\n\"The boy prays,\" Torquemada says quietly to a fellow Dominican. \"Truly prays. One can always tell.\"\n\n\nIt is a small victory, but a real one. The clergy will remember Fernando's sincerity long after they have forgotten his shyness with secular lords.\n\n\n\nThe Count of Benavente\n\n\nThe Count approaches the children with the slightly dazed expression of a man still processing his conversation with Catalina. He offers Fernando the same courtesy he offered the sister—and receives something very different in return.\n\n\n\"Your Highness,\" Benavente says. \"A pleasure to meet the heir of Castile.\"\n\n\nFernando looks up at him. For a moment, his gentle eyes study the Count's face with an intensity that surprises.\n\n\n\"You were worried,\" Fernando says suddenly. \"In the big room. When Father was talking. Your face was worried.\"\n\n\nThe Count blinks. Whatever response he expected from a three-year-old prince, this was not it.\n\n\n\"I... had concerns, yes,\" Benavente manages. \"About matters of the realm.\"\n\n\nFernando nods seriously. \"Father will fix it,\" he says with simple confidence. \"Father fixes things.\"\n\n\nIt is not the dazzling political insight of his sister. It is not a command performance. It is simply a small boy who loves his father and trusts him absolutely, saying so to a powerful stranger.\n\n\nBenavente's expression softens slightly. \"I am sure he will, Your Highness,\" he says, and there is less ice in his voice than there was a moment ago.\n\n\n\nThe Shadow of Comparison\n\n\nBy midday, the whispers have sorted themselves.\n\n\nCatalina is the marvel—the prodigy, the four-year-old who held court like a queen. Her name dominates every conversation.\n\n\nFernando is... acceptable. Promising. A fine-looking boy with a devout heart and a gentle manner. He will grow into his role, no doubt. He has time.\n\n\nThe comparisons are inevitable, and they are not kind.\n\n\n\"The girl has fire. The boy is sweet, but...\"\n\n\n\"He has the look of a king, certainly. But does he have the steel?\"\n\n\n\"Perhaps he will harden as he ages. Boys often do.\"\n\n\n\"Still, with a sister like that... he will need to find his own path, or be forever in her shadow.\"\n\n\nThe Count of Alba does not approach you about Fernando as he did about Catalina. No one speaks of the prince with wonder or warning. They speak of him with hope—the polite hope that adults offer when a child shows potential but not proof.\n\n\n\nEvening — The Private Apartments\n\n\nYou return with your family as the sun sets. Teresa sleeps. Bianca fusses. Catalina sits by the window, still and watchful.\n\n\nFernando climbs into Lucia's lap and buries his face against her shoulder. He is exhausted—drained by the attention, the noise, the endless parade of strange adults who stared at him and asked him questions and wanted things from him that he did not fully understand.\n\n\n\"Did I do well, Mama?\" he asks, his voice muffled.\n\n\nLucia strokes his hair. \"You did very well, tesoro. You made us proud.\"\n\n\nHe is quiet for a moment. Then, still not lifting his head:\n\n\n\"Catalina was better.\"\n\n\nIt is not accusation. Not jealousy. Simply observation—the honest assessment of a brilliant child who knows exactly where he stands.\n\n\nLucia's hand pauses in his hair. She looks at you over Fernando's head, and in her eyes you see the question that will define your son's life:\n\n\nHow do you raise an heir in the shadow of a sister who outshines him?\n\n\nFernando is everything a prince should be—brilliant, pious, physically magnificent, genuinely good. But Catalina is something else. Something more. Something that commands attention simply by existing.\n\n\nYour son will be king someday. Your daughter will be... what?\n\n\nThe question hangs in the evening air, unanswered.\n\n\n\nFernando performed acceptably. The realm sees a promising heir—devout, well-formed, gentle. But beside Catalina's legendary debut, \"promising\" feels almost like failure. The clergy are impressed by his sincere faith. The secular lords are reserving judgment. The shadow of comparison has already begun to fall.\n\n\nWhat would you do?",

I need to think about what song a four-year-old princess in 1436 Castile might know and choose to sing. Given her traits - brilliant, commanding, but spiritually empty - this is an interesting moment.\n\nShe would know:\n- Religious hymns (Latin, likely)\n- Castilian ballads (romances)\n- Nursery songs\n- Court songs\n\nGiven her empty piety but her brilliant mind, she would choose something that would impress - she's performing, after all. She understands this is a moment to shine further.\n\nA Latin hymn would impress the clergy. A Castilian romance would please the nobility. \n\nLet me think about what would be most dramatically appropriate and historically authentic. The Cantigas de Santa Maria were famous medieval Spanish songs. There were also romances - ballads about heroes and battles.\n\nGiven Catalina's nature - she's performing piety she doesn't feel - a religious hymn sung perfectly but without true feeling would be very fitting. But the audience wouldn't necessarily notice the emptiness; they'd just hear a beautiful performance.\n\nOr she might choose something that shows off her brilliance - perhaps singing in Latin to impress the clergy, or a complex song.\n\nI should draft a chaos roll table for how her performance goes. This is a four-year-old singing before the entire Cortes - there's definitely uncertainty here even with her remarkable abilities.\n\nActually, the user just wants me to narrate what happens. Let me describe her choice and her performance, then perhaps roll for how it lands.\n\nActually, I should probably draft a d100 table for this as it's a significant moment with uncertainty. But the user didn't ask for a roll - they just said to give her the stage.\n\nLet me narrate this naturally. She already rolled a 96 for her overall presentation - this is part of that legendary debut. So I should describe something remarkable that fits with that result.\n\nI'll have her choose a song that demonstrates both her brilliance and her calculating nature - perhaps a religious hymn sung with technical perfection, or a Castilian ballad about crusade/glory that would resonate with this crowd. Given the context of the Cortes and the crusade theme, something that ties into that would be very fitting.\n \nI'll carefully craft her initial performance, capturing the moment's tension and her calculated brilliance. She'll select a hymn that showcases her linguistic skill and emotional control, choosing a piece that resonates with the political and religious atmosphere of the moment. Her performance will be precise, controlled, and designed to leave a lasting impression on every listener in the room.\n\n\nYou rise and step aside, giving your daughter the space she has earned.\n\n\nCatalina walks forward—not to the center of the hall, but to a spot where the acoustics serve her, where the afternoon light from the high windows catches the gold thread in her gown. A four-year-old should not know such things. Catalina knows.\n\n\nShe folds her hands before her, exactly as the chapel singers do. She takes a breath.\n\n\nAnd then she sings.\n\n\n\nThe song she chooses is Stella Splendens—the hymn to the Virgin from the Llibre Vermell de Montserrat, old and haunting, sung by pilgrims for a hundred years. It is not a child's song. It is not an easy song. The Latin is complex, the melody demanding, the range challenging even for trained voices.\n\n\nCatalina sings it perfectly.\n\n\nStella splendens in monte\nut solis radium...\n\n\nHer voice is small—she is four, and her lungs are a child's lungs—but it is pure and clear as mountain water. Each Latin syllable is precisely formed. Each note lands exactly where it should. The melody flows from her as if she has sung it a thousand times, though you know she has only heard it at Mass and practiced with her tutor perhaps a dozen times.\n\n\nMiraculis serrato\nexaudi populum...\n\n\nThe hall is utterly silent. The great lords stand frozen. The clergy stare. Even the servants along the walls have stopped moving.\n\n\nThis is not a child singing a song to please her father.\n\n\nThis is a performance—calculated, controlled, designed to leave an impression that will not fade.\n\n\nAnd yet... and yet...\n\n\nFray Tomás de Torquemada watches with those burning eyes. His lips thin slightly. The hymn is perfect. Too perfect. The words praise the Virgin, beg for her intercession, speak of miracles and faith—and they emerge from Catalina's mouth like polished gems, beautiful and cold and hard.\n\n\nThere is no feeling in them. No devotion. Only excellence.\n\n\nMost of the hall does not notice. They see a four-year-old prodigy singing a pilgrim's hymn in flawless Latin. They see a miracle.\n\n\nTorquemada sees something else.\n\n\n\nThe final note fades into silence.\n\n\nFor a heartbeat, no one moves.\n\n\nThen the Duke of Medina Sidonia begins to clap—and the hall erupts. Applause thunders from every corner. Men stamp their feet. A few of the clergy are openly weeping. The procuradores look at one another in disbelief.\n\n\nCatalina curtsies—low, graceful, perfect—and returns to your side. She takes Fernando's hand again, and her face shows nothing but composure.\n\n\nOnly when she glances up at you is there a flicker of something beneath the mask.\n\n\nDid I do well, Father?\n\n\nThe question is not asked aloud. But it is there, in those dark and ancient eyes.\n\n\n\nThe Cortes of 1436 has witnessed something they will tell their grandchildren about. A four-year-old princess who debated lords, charmed skeptics, and sang a pilgrim's hymn in perfect Latin before the assembled realm.\n\n\nBut Fray Tomás de Torquemada watched. And he is a man who sees what others miss.\n\n\nHow do you respond to your daughter?",

Any notable reactions from specific NPCs (like Torquemada who was watching critically)\n5. Lucia's reaction\n\nI should stop at a natural point where Juan might want to act or speak again.\n\n\nCatalina rises into the air, your hands firm around her small waist, and for a moment she is above everyone—above the grandees in their finery, above the bishops in their vestments, above the banners and the guards and the ancient stone walls of the Alcázar.\n\n\nThe applause swells. Men who moments ago debated mustering systems and command structures now cheer for a child. The Duke of Medina Sidonia is clapping with genuine enthusiasm. The Count of Benavente—the skeptic, the critic—watches with an expression approaching wonder. The Admiral pounds his palm against his thigh in the manner of sailors.\n\n\nCatalina looks out over the sea of faces. Her dark eyes move across the hall, taking it in—the power, the wealth, the ancient houses of Castile, all of them applauding her.\n\n\nAnd something shifts in her face.\n\n\nFor just an instant, the mask slips. The composure cracks. And beneath it you see not calculation, not performance, but something raw and real—a four-year-old girl who has pleased her father and made a room full of strangers love her, and who does not quite know what to do with the feeling.\n\n\nHer small hands grip your wrists. Her lips part slightly.\n\n\nThen she smiles.\n\n\nIt is not her usual smile—the polished, careful expression she offers to tutors and servants. This smile is real. Bright and sudden and startlingly young. For one moment, she is not the prodigy, not the marvel, not the princess who held court like a queen.\n\n\nShe is just Catalina. Your daughter. Happy.\n\n\n\nLucia watches from her chair, one hand on her belly, tears glistening in her eyes. She is not Catalina's mother by blood—that was Isabel, gone now these three years—but she has raised this girl as her own, and the pride on her face is genuine.\n\n\nFernando stands beside his stepmother, looking up at his sister held aloft. His expression is complicated—admiration and love and something else, something quieter. He is not jealous, not exactly. He simply sees. He sees what Catalina is, and what he is not, and he is trying to understand what that means.\n\n\nHe is three years old. He should not have to understand such things yet.\n\n\nBut he is brilliant, your son. And brilliant children see more than they should.\n\n\n\nThe applause begins to fade. The moment cannot last forever. Soon you will lower Catalina back to the ground, and the Cortes will return to formality, and the legend of this day will begin its long life in memory and chronicle.\n\n\nBut for now—for this one suspended instant—you hold your daughter high, and she smiles her real smile, and the realm sees a king who loves his children.\n\n\nIt is, perhaps, the most important thing they have seen today.\n\n\n\nThe hall awaits your next action.",

Juan is asking Fernando if he liked his sister's singing and reassuring him that he has other skills that will develop.\n\nI need to stop after Fernando's response or reaction - I should not generate dialogue or actions for Juan. Let me write Fernando's response to his father's question and then stop, waiting for the user's next input.\n\nFernando is:\n- 3 years old\n- Brilliant intelligence\n- Bold temperament (though currently a bit overwhelmed)\n- Reluctant martial aptitude\n- Extraordinary language talent\n- Sincere piety\n- Magnificent physical presence\n- Gentle, warm nature - seeks approval\n\nHe just watched his sister give a legendary performance. He's been noted as feeling overshadowed (\"Catalina was better\"). He's exhausted and overwhelmed. But he also genuinely loves his sister - he's not jealous in a mean way, just observant about where he stands.\n\nHe should respond authentically - a three-year-old's response, honest and simple, but with hints of his brilliant mind and gentle nature.\n\n\nFernando looks up at you, his gentle eyes searching your face. The question is simple, but at three years old—brilliant, observant, already feeling the weight of comparison—he takes a moment to consider it.\n\n\nHis gaze drifts to Catalina, who has resumed her place beside Lucia, her composure restored, the real smile already fading back behind the mask. He watches her for a heartbeat.\n\n\nThen he looks back at you.\n\n\n\"She sings like the angels in church,\" he says softly. His voice is quiet but steady—not the near-inaudible mumble he offered the nobles earlier. This is private. Safe. Just him and his father. \"The ones in the paintings. With the gold.\"\n\n\nHe pauses, his small brow furrowing slightly. Something is working behind those eyes—a thought too complex for his years, struggling to find words simple enough for his tongue.\n\n\n\"Father,\" he says, and there is a question in it, hesitant and serious. \"When I am bigger... will people clap for me too?\"\n\n\nHe does not ask it with jealousy. He does not ask it with resentment. He asks it the way a child asks if the sun will rise tomorrow—hoping for reassurance that the world works the way it should, that there is a place for him in it.\n\n\nHis magnificent little frame stands before you, waiting for an answer.\n\n\n\nHow do you respond?",

They clap for me because because I protect the weak and the innocent. They clap for because I fight for what is just. And not just fight with my sword. If you are honest, pious and just, people will clap for you just as they did for your sister. We all have our talents.",

      "text": "Thought process: Orchestrated authentic child reaction to father's wisdom about virtue.\n\nThe user is speaking to Fernando, his three-year-old son, explaining that people will admire and applaud him not for singing, but for being honest, pious, and just. This is a touching father-son moment.\n\nI need to show Fernando's reaction to this without generating any dialogue or actions for Juan. I should stop after Fernando responds or after the scene naturally concludes, waiting for the player's next action.\n\nFernando's traits:\n- Brilliant (will understand more than a typical 3-year-old)\n- Sincere piety (this message about being just and pious will resonate)\n- Gentle, warm nature\n- Bold temperament (though overwhelmed in crowds)\n- Reluctant martial aptitude (violence unsettles him)\n- Magnificent physical presence\n\nJuan is telling him that his path to admiration is through justice, honesty, and piety - not through martial prowess or performance like Catalina's. This should resonate deeply with Fernando's nature - he IS pious, he IS gentle, and hearing that these qualities matter may be exactly what he needs.\n\nI should show his reaction authentically - a three-year-old processing deep words from his father, finding comfort in them.\n\n\nFernando listens with the intensity that only children possess—that pure, undivided attention that drinks in every word as if it were water in a desert.\n\n\nHis brow remains furrowed as he works through what you have said. Honest. Pious. Just. These are words he knows. Words from his prayers, from his lessons, from the quiet moments when the chaplain speaks of God and goodness.\n\n\nSomething shifts in his face. The uncertainty does not vanish entirely—he is three, and the shadow of his sister's triumph still looms—but it eases. A weight lifts from those small shoulders.\n\n\n\"I am pious,\" he says slowly, testing the idea. It is not boasting. It is a child recognizing something true about himself, perhaps for the first time. \"Father Alejandro says I pray good. Well,\" he corrects himself, remembering his grammar. \"I pray well.\"\n\n\nHe looks toward the hall, where the nobles still mill about, where moments ago they thundered applause for Catalina's song.\n\n\nThen he looks back at you.\n\n\n\"I will be just,\" he says. The words come out with a solemnity that seems too large for his small frame. A promise made before he fully understands what promises cost. \"Like you, Father.\"\n\n\nHe steps forward and wraps his arms around your neck—a sudden, fierce embrace, the kind only small children give. His cheek presses against yours.\n\n\n\"I love you,\" he whispers.\n\n\n\nNearby, Lucia watches with shining eyes. Catalina observes from beside her stepmother, her expression unreadable—but she does not look away from the embrace between father and son.\n\n\nThe nobles pretend not to notice. But they notice.",
