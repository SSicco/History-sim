Let me summarize the key details:\n\n**Date/Time:** January 7, 1438, Evening (after Vespers)\n**Location:** Toledo, Alcázar, Great Hall\n**Present:** Juan, Queen Lucia (holding Nicolás), Princess Catalina, Prince Fernando, Princess Bianca, Princess Teresa, Princess Juana, nurses, courtiers, servants\n**Situation:** Family reunion complete; Juan has just named his newborn son Nicolás; Catalina asking to see the baby\n**Juan's Condition:** Healthy; relieved to be home; emotionally moved by reunion\n\nJuan has just returned from Naples, arrived at vespers on Epiphany (January 7), met his family including his newborn son Nicolás (born late 1437), and has just named him. Catalina is asking to see the baby.\n\nThe chapter will pick up exactly where it left off - mid-reunion, with Catalina demanding to see baby Nicolás.\n\nI should write a brief chapter introduction that orients the player to this moment.\n\nChapter 2.44\n\nJanuary 7th, 1438, Evening\n\nThe great hall of the Alcázar glows with the warmth of braziers and candlelight. You have just arrived home after the long journey from Naples—through Sardinia, Majorca, Barcelona, and Zaragoza—finding unusually fair weather for winter. The timing could not have been more fitting: Epiphany evening, the Feast of the Three Kings.\n\nYour family surrounds you. Lucia stands radiant despite the obvious weariness of recent childbirth, holding the bundled form of your newborn son in her arms. You have just spoken his name aloud for the first time: Nicolás, for Saint Nicholas of Myra, protector of children and sailors, the Greek meaning \"Victory of the people.\" Six children now. Fernando tugs at your traveling cloak, demanding attention, while little Bianca watches from a nurse's arms with her mother's grey-green eyes. Teresa squirms in the grip of another nurse, and Juana—not yet two—is already reaching toward her mother with an intensity that seems beyond her age.\n\nPrincess Catalina, nearly six years old now, stands with her hands on her hips in perfect imitation of a great lady addressing an unsatisfactory steward. Her dark eyes are fixed on the bundle in Lucia's arms.\n\n\"I want to see him,\" she announces—not a request, but a royal command. \"Is he suitable?\"",

The other children shift in their nurses' arms, sensing the moment's importance. Fernando releases your cloak and trails behind, not wanting to be left out.\n\nLucia lowers herself carefully to one knee, bringing the bundle closer to Catalina's eye level. The baby's face is red and wrinkled, eyes squeezed shut, a tuft of dark hair visible beneath the swaddling cloth. He makes a small sound—not quite a cry, more a declaration of existence.\n\nCatalina studies him with the gravity of a bishop examining a relic.\n\n\"He's very small,\" she observes. Then, after a moment's consideration: \"I suppose he'll grow.\"\n\nAt your question about the saints, she looks up at you. Her expression shifts—not quite discomfort, but something more like the careful neutrality of a diplomat asked about a subject outside her expertise.\n\n\"Father Tomás tells us about them,\" she says. \"Saint Nicholas brings gifts to children on his feast day. And he saved sailors in a storm.\" She recites this as one might recite the principal exports of Flanders—accurate information, correctly filed, emotionally distant. \"There are many saints. They did miracles and died for God.\"\n\nShe looks back at the baby.\n\n\"Will he do miracles?\"\n\nLucia catches your eye above Catalina's head, a flicker of something passing between you. She knows, as you do, about the rolls—about the empty place where faith should kindle in your eldest daughter's heart.",

She's also described as imperious.\n\nI should have Catalina respond in character - she's very intelligent, so she might engage with the philosophical question, but her spiritual emptiness means she might approach it more practically or intellectually rather than with wonder. She's also imperious and commanding.\n\nThis is a dialogue scene, so I should keep it SHORT (2-4 paragraphs) and stop after the NPC speaks so the player can respond.\n\nCatalina tilts her head, considering the question with the seriousness she brings to all matters of importance. Behind her, Fernando has crept closer, trying to peer around his sister at the baby. Lucia shifts Nicolás slightly so the candlelight catches his face.\n\n\"Mama says it hurts,\" Catalina says matter-of-factly. She glances at Lucia, then back to you. \"She says it hurts very much, but then you forget because you love them.\" A pause. \"I don't understand how you can forget something that hurts. I remember when I fell from the pony. That hurt, and I still remember.\"\n\nShe reaches out one finger and touches Nicolás's cheek—gently, with surprising care for a child so often imperious.\n\n\"I suppose I will have children,\" she continues, in the tone of someone acknowledging an inevitable administrative duty. \"Queens have children. That's what queens do.\" She withdraws her finger and looks up at you again. \"Will I be a queen, Papa? You have three crowns now. Surely you can spare one.\"\n\nLucia's lips twitch—not quite suppressing a smile. Little Fernando, emboldened by Catalina's proximity to the baby, tugs at your hand.\n\n\"I want to see!

He's described as brilliant (82), bold (64), with a special talent for languages (76), sincere piety (50), and magnificent physical presence (87). But he has a reluctant martial aptitude (9) - he cannot fight.\n\nCatalina is nearly 6 (born January 1432). She's brilliant (87), commanding (76), with a legendary singing voice, but indifferent piety (7) - spiritually empty. She's beautiful (70).\n\nLet me write Fernando's reaction to seeing his baby brother, then Catalina's response to Juan's question about crowns. I should keep this scene warm and domestic, showing the children's personalities.\n\nYou lift Fernando up, and he wraps his arms around your neck for balance, leaning forward to stare at his new brother with the intensity of a scholar examining a newly discovered manuscript. At four and a half, he already has your build—broad-shouldered for his age, with a physical presence that draws the eye. His dark hair falls across his forehead as he peers down.\n\n\"He looks like a turnip,\" Fernando announces with evident disappointment. \"A red turnip.\"\n\n\"Fernando,\" Lucia says, though her voice carries more amusement than reproach.\n\n\"Well, he does.\" Fernando twists to look at you, his face inches from yours. \"Did I look like a turnip when I was born, Papa?\"\n\nBefore you can answer, Catalina has seized upon your question with considerably more enthusiasm than she showed for saints.\n\n\"Naples,\" she says immediately. Then hesitates, her brow furrowing. \"But Naples speaks... what does Naples speak? Not Castilian. Not the language the Pope uses—\"\n\n\"Italian,\" Lucia supplies. \"Though Neapolitan is its own dialect. Rougher than Ferrarese.\"\n\n\"Italian,\" Catalina repeats, filing this away. \"And Aragon speaks...?\"\n\nShe trails off, looking at you expectantly. This, at least, is a subject that engages her—the concrete mechanics of power, the practical requirements of rule. Not miracles or saints, but crowns and languages and knowing your people.\n\nFernando, still in your arms, has lost interest in the conversation and is trying to reach down to poke Nicolás's nose.",

She would have been very young during that trip - about 2 years old. It's unlikely she would have clear memories from that age, though she might have vague impressions or have been told stories about it.\n\nLet me think about how Catalina would respond. She's described as:\n- Genuinely intelligent - learns quickly, remembers details\n- Sunny, affectionate disposition but imperious manner\n- Extraordinary singing voice\n- But spiritually empty (piety roll of 7)\n\nAt nearly 6, being asked about something from when she was 2-2.5, she might have fragmentary memories or conflate what she actually remembers with stories she's been told.\n\nI should have her respond authentically - perhaps some vague impressions, or admitting she doesn't really remember, or mixing up details. This is a good opportunity for characterization.\n\nCatalina's expression shifts—the confident administrator giving way to something more uncertain. She is silent for a moment, and you can almost see her reaching back through the years, searching for images that would have been laid down when she was barely more than two years old.\n\n\"I remember... water,\" she says slowly. \"So much water. And the ship moving.\" Her hand makes a gentle rocking motion. \"And I was sick. My stomach hurt.\"\n\nShe frowns, frustrated by the inadequacy of these fragments.\n\n\"There were big walls. Very big. Brown and old.\" Constantinople's land walls, perhaps—or a child's impression of them, magnified by memory. \"And people who talked strangely. Not like us.\"\n\nLucia nods gently. \"You were very young, tesoro. Not yet three.\"\n\n\"I remember you,\" Catalina says suddenly, looking at Lucia with a flash of clarity. \"You held me when the ship moved too much. You sang to me.\" A pause. \"You smelled like flowers.\"\n\nSomething softens in Lucia's face.\n\nFernando, still in your arms, has successfully poked Nicolás's cheek, causing the baby to scrunch his face and emit a small, offended sound. Lucia gently intercepts Fernando's hand before he can repeat the experiment.\n\n\"I don't remember Naples,\" Catalina admits, returning to the original question. Her tone suggests this is a personal failing she intends to rectify. \"But I can learn it. I can learn Italian and the dialect and the people.\" She straightens. \"When can I go back?\"",

      "text": "Juan is teasing Catalina a bit here, offering her the chance to leave tomorrow. This is playful fatherly banter. Catalina is almost six years old - precocious and imperious, but still a child. Let me think about how she would respond to this.\n\nShe's been presented with a challenge - the long journey, sailing. She knows from experience that sailing made her sick. But she's also proud and doesn't like to back down. Her traits show she's commanding (76), brilliant (87), and has that legendary singing voice. But she's also spiritually empty (piety 7).\n\nI should play this as a child who is caught between wanting to appear capable and brave, and the reality that she's still a little girl who got seasick. She might try to bluff, or she might be more honest. Given her intelligence, she probably knows she's being tested or teased.\n\nFernando is still in Juan's arms, and there are the other children around. Lucia is present. Let me write a response that captures the family dynamic and Catalina's character.\n\nCatalina's eyes widen—for just a moment, the imperious young queen giving way to a startled child who has been called on a bluff she didn't realize she was making. Fernando giggles in your arms, sensing his sister's discomfort with the unerring instinct of younger siblings everywhere.\n\n\"Tomorrow?\" Catalina repeats. She recovers quickly, drawing herself up. \"I am not afraid of sailing, Papa. I simply... found it disagreeable.\"\n\n\"She was sick for three days,\" Fernando contributes helpfully. \"Nurse María said she turned green.\"\n\n\"I was two,\" Catalina snaps at him. \"I am almost six now. That is entirely different.\"\n\nShe turns back to you, and you can see the calculation happening behind her eyes—the same sharp intelligence that lets her learn so quickly now wrestling with pride, practicality, and the dawning suspicion that her father might be teasing her.\n\n\"Perhaps,\" she says carefully, \"I should wait until spring. The seas are calmer in spring. That is... strategic. Not fearful. Kings wait for good weather before campaigns. Father Tomás told me about your grandfather, how he—\"\n\nShe stops, narrows her eyes at you.\n\n\"You're laughing at me, Papa.\"\n\nLucia makes a small sound that might be a cough.",

She is dappled grey with a white star on her forehead. Don Álvaro gave her to me for my fifth nameday.\" A note of pride enters her voice. \"I can canter now.

Alfonso V died in September 1437\n2. María (Juan's sister, Alfonso's widow) accepted an invitation to come to Toledo\n3. Catalina wrote a letter inviting her Aunt María to Toledo\n4. María would help Juan navigate Aragonese politics\n\nSo María is now a widow, and she's staying with Juan's family in Toledo. This is after Alfonso's death and Juan's inheritance of Aragon. She would be grieving her husband but also supporting her brother.\n\nLet me write a response for María as an NPC. She's Juan's sister, was regent of Aragon in Alfonso's absence, and is now a widow. She should be portrayed with appropriate emotional depth - glad to be with family but also dealing with the loss of her husband.\n\nYou turn from the cluster of children toward the edge of the gathering, where a woman in widow's black stands apart from the nurses and courtiers. Queen María of Aragon—your sister, Alfonso's widow these past four months—has been watching the family reunion with an expression that mingles warmth and something more complex. At forty-two, she carries herself with the dignity of a woman who has ruled a kingdom in her husband's name, but the severity of her mourning dress cannot quite conceal the softness around her eyes as she watches her nieces and nephews.\n\nShe steps forward when you address her, managing a smile that does not entirely reach those eyes.\n\n\"Home,\" she repeats, as if tasting the word. \"It has been... many years since I thought of anywhere as home, brother. Barcelona became mine by necessity. Zaragoza by duty.\" She glances around the great hall of the Alcázar—the Castilian banners, the familiar architecture of their shared childhood. \"This place... I had almost forgotten how it smelled. Stone and brazier smoke and something underneath that is just Toledo.\"\n\nShe pauses, composing herself.\n\n\"The children have been a blessing. Catalina's letter—\" A genuine smile now, fleeting but real. \"She informed me that I was to come immediately because she required an aunt who understood proper Aragonese manners, and that her father's attempts were, I quote, 'insufficient.'\"\n\nFrom across the room, Catalina looks up with an expression of perfect innocence.\n\nMaría's voice softens. \"I am grateful to be here, Juan. Truly. Alfonso would have wanted...\" She stops, swallows. \"He spoke of you often, toward the end. Of what you built together. He was proud, I think, that you would carry it forward.\"\n\nHer hands twist briefly in her black sleeves before she stills them.\n\n\"But settling in? I confess I do not know what that means anymore. I was regent for twelve years. Now I am...\" She searches for the word. \"A guest. A widow. An aunt.\" A pause. \"What am I, brother?\"",

Fernando excels in scholarly pursuits but struggles with physical activities. Bianca requires careful attention due to her delicate health, while Teresa remains the most robust and adaptable. Even at one year old, Juana displays an extraordinary magnetic personality. The companion children are integrating well, creating a dynamic and supportive environment for learning and play.\n\nMaría's eyes glisten for just a moment before she masters herself. She reaches out and touches your arm—a gesture she might not have permitted herself even a year ago, when she was still Regent of Aragon and every action carried political weight.\n\n\"Just a sister,\" she says quietly. \"I think I had forgotten how to be that.\" She glances at the children, at Catalina now interrogating little Bianca about something, at Fernando still hovering near the baby. \"Very well. I shall practice being an aunt.

The journey from Naples, the birth, the weeks of recovery have left faint shadows beneath her grey-green eyes, but her mind remains as sharp as ever.\n\n\"The tutors are adequate,\" she says, in a tone that suggests adequate is not entirely a compliment. \"Father Tomás handles Scripture and Latin. The children can recite their prayers correctly, and Catalina's Latin is coming along well—she has an ear for it. Fernando...\" She pauses. \"Fernando devours languages. Father Tomás says he has never seen a child pick up conjugations so quickly. He is already asking about Greek.\"\n\nShe glances at Fernando, who has abandoned the baby and is now showing María something—a wooden knight, perhaps, from his pocket.\n\n\"But fun? Friends?\" Lucia's expression softens. \"That is where Casa de las Palomas has proven its worth. The companion children—Pedro, Gonzalito, Inés, little Lucía—they play together daily. Catalina...\" A diplomatic pause. \"Catalina organizes them. She decides what games they will play and assigns roles.

The physicians say her constitution requires extra rest. I have the nurses watch her carefully.\"\n\nShe looks down at Juana, who has somehow escaped her nurse and is now clutching Lucia's skirts, staring up at her mother with an intensity that seems beyond her fourteen months.\n\n\"And this one.\" Lucia's voice takes on a wondering note. \"She follows people. Not walking well yet, but she crawls after whoever interests her—servants, visitors, her siblings. And when she reaches them, she simply... looks at them. Until they pick her up.\" She strokes Juana's dark hair. \"The nurses say she has never cried to be held. She simply arrives, and somehow you find yourself holding her.\"\n\nLucia meets your eyes.\n\n\"They are happy, Juan. As happy as royal children can be, with duties and tutors and expectations. But yes—they play. They quarrel. They make up. They are becoming people.\" A pause. \"It is terrifying, honestly.\"",

Tutors overwhelmed, companion families feeling displaced by new children, old problems resurfacing. Reform needed again.\n16-30\nAdequate — The household functions, but magic has faded. Children learn their lessons, play when allowed, but the spark of genuine community has dimmed into routine.\n31-50\nStable — The foundation holds. Children are healthy, learning, playing together. Some friction as personalities develop, but nothing beyond normal childhood conflicts.\n51-70\nThriving — The household has matured beautifully. Bonds have deepened, older children help younger ones, companion families fully integrated. A genuine community.\n71-85\nFlourishing — Beyond expectations. The children have formed something remarkable—friendships that transcend rank, mutual care, emerging leadership. Staff report this is unlike any noble household they've served.\n86-95\nExceptional — Casa de las Palomas has become a model. Visiting nobles ask how it works. The children's development—social, intellectual, physical—exceeds all reasonable hopes.\n96-100\nExtraordinary — Something unexpected has emerged. A development no one planned for, but which promises to shape these children's futures in ways not yet understood.\n\nPlease roll d100.",

I do not know the word. Not quite teachers, not quite guardians. They organize the younger children. When Teresa fell and scraped her knee last month, it was Pedro who carried her to the nurse, and Catalina who held her hand and told her stories until she stopped crying. Not because anyone told them to. Because that is simply what they do now.\"\n\nFernando, still hovering near your leg, pipes up: \"Gonzalito teaches me climbing. He says I'm almost ready for the big oak.\"\n\n\"And Lucía—the seamstress's daughter—she has become something of a court artist,\" Lucia adds with a note of wonder. \"She draws portraits of everyone. The children trade them like treasures. She made one of Bianca sleeping that the nurses framed and hung in the nursery.\"\n\nMaría, who has been listening quietly, speaks up. \"I visited last week, while you were still at sea. I have seen many noble households, brother. This is... not like them. The children do not sort themselves by rank. They sort themselves by interest. The climbers climb together. The ones who love stories gather with Sister Margarita. The little ones follow whoever will carry them.\" She pauses. \"Catalina held court in the garden, settling a dispute between Pedro and Gonzalito over whose turn it was with the wooden swords. She listened to both sides, asked questions, and rendered judgment. She was fair, Juan. Not imperious—fair. The boys accepted her ruling without complaint.\"\n\nLucia nods. \"The staff say they have never served in a household like this. Two of Doña Beatriz's friends—women who run noble nurseries in Burgos and Valladolid—have written asking if they might visit and observe.\"\n\nLittle Juana, still clinging to Lucia's skirts, looks up at you with those dark, intent eyes. Even at fourteen months, there is something in her gaze that seems to see more than it should.\n\n\"There is one thing,\" Lucia adds, her voice softening. \"Catalina still does not pray. Not really. She says the words, makes the gestures. Sister Margarita says she is perfect—every response correct, every genuflection precise. But there is nothing behind it. She asked Sister Margarita once why God lets children die, and when Sister Margarita spoke of heaven and mystery, Catalina simply nodded and changed the subject.\" A pause. \"She did not argue. She did not rebel. She simply... filed it away as information that did not concern her.\"\n\nLucia meets your eyes.\n\n\"Everything else flourishes, Juan.

But also show that the spiritual emptiness is real - not something that can be fixed by a single conversation\n4. Stop when Juan asks the question - let the player see how Catalina responds\n\nThis should be a poignant scene. Catalina will try, because she loves her father. But the hollowness will show through despite her efforts.\n\nThe evening unfolds in a procession of small rituals. Fernando demands a story about knights and falls asleep halfway through, his wooden sword clutched to his chest. Bianca, fragile and fussy from a long day, requires gentle rocking and a lullaby from one of the nurses before her grey-green eyes finally close. Teresa sleeps easily, as she does everything easily—a child who seems to have decided that life requires no particular struggle. Little Juana watches you with that uncanny intensity until the very moment sleep takes her, as if memorizing your face. And Nicolás, only weeks old, knows nothing yet but warmth and milk and the steady heartbeat of whoever holds him.\n\nCatalina waits.\n\nShe has changed into her nightshift, her dark hair brushed and braided by her nurse. She sits on the edge of her bed in the chamber she shares with Bianca and Teresa—though Bianca sleeps in a separate alcove where the nurses can attend her more easily. The room is warm, a brazier glowing in the corner, and the shutters are closed against the January cold.\n\nWhen you enter, she looks up with an expression that mingles pleasure and something more guarded. She is almost six years old, and already you can see the woman she will become—the sharp intelligence, the careful observation, the way she assesses situations before committing to them.\n\n\"Papa.\" She shifts to make room for you on the edge of the bed. \"You were gone a long time. Longer than you said.\"\n\nThere is no accusation in her voice. Just a statement of fact, filed away alongside everything else she notices.\n\nAt your question about prayer, something flickers across her face—too quick to name, gone before you can be certain you saw it. She folds her hands in her lap, the gesture precise, learned.\n\n\"We could pray for Nicolás,\" she says after a moment. \"That he grows strong. Sister Margarita says we should pray for babies because God listens especially for them.\" A pause. \"Or for the sailors. You said Saint Nicholas protects sailors. There are always sailors who need protecting.\"\n\nShe looks at you, and for just an instant, her composure slips—and beneath it you see not rebellion, not doubt, but something more troubling: a child trying very hard to give the right answer to a test she does not understand.\n\n\"What do you pray about, Papa?\" she asks. \"When you pray alone, not in the chapel where everyone watches. What do you say to God?\"",

She says my mother was kind and that she loved me very much.\" A pause. \"She says I have her chin.\"\n\nShe is quiet for a long moment, processing what you have told her.

Not quite an accusation.

You conquered Granada. You went to Constantinople.

He's explaining that God loves all his children equally, regardless of wealth or status - that's what \"we are all equal before God\" means.\n\nCatalina has a piety roll of 7 - spiritually empty. This is a private wound for Juan. She goes through the motions perfectly but there's nothing behind it. She asked Sister Margarita why God lets children die and just filed the answer away as \"information that did not concern her.\"\n\nNow Juan is trying to explain God's fairness and love. Catalina is brilliant (intelligence 87) and will process this logically. But her spiritual emptiness means she's approaching this intellectually, not with faith.\n\nI should have Catalina respond in a way that shows her intelligence engaging with the concept, but also hints at that hollow place where faith should be. She might find a logical inconsistency, or she might simply accept it as information without it touching her heart. \n\nThis is a delicate moment. Juan is trying to reach her, and I need to show both his love and her distance - not rebellious distance, but that troubling emptiness the rolls indicated.\n\nLet me write Catalina's response carefully - she's almost six, brilliant, and spiritually empty but not hostile to religion. She just... doesn't feel it.\n\nCatalina considers this, her brow furrowing in that way it does when she encounters a new idea that requires sorting. Her hand remains in yours, small and warm.\n\n\"So Pedro's prayers are worth the same as yours,\" she says slowly, working through the logic. \"Even though you are King and he is a sergeant's son. Because God does not count crowns.\"\n\nShe nods to herself, as if this makes a certain kind of sense.\n\n\"That is... fair,\" she admits. \"Like how I do not let Gonzalito win just because he is oldest. The rules are the rules.\"\n\nBut then something else crosses her face—that flicker again, the thing you cannot quite name. She looks down at her hands, at her fingers intertwined with yours.\n\n\"But Papa...\" She hesitates. This is not a child who hesitates often. \"If God is fair, and God loves everyone the same, and God listens to everyone the same...\"\n\nShe looks up at you, and her dark eyes are troubled in a way that has nothing to do with rebellion or defiance. It is the look of someone who has found a knot they cannot untie.\n\n\"Then why did my mother die and Lucia-mama live? They both had babies. They both prayed. You prayed for both of them.\" Her voice is very small now. \"Was God being fair to my mother? Was He being fair to me?\"\n\nShe is not crying. Catalina rarely cries. But there is something raw beneath the words—not anger at God, not doubt precisely, but a question that has been sitting inside her for longer than she has had words for it.\n\n\"I am not angry,\" she adds quickly, as if worried she has said something wrong. \"I just... I do not understand. And Sister Margarita says 'mystery' but that is not an answer, Papa. That is just a word for 'I do not know.'\"",

Setting up the blankets\n5. The scene of them lying down looking at the stars\n6. Then stop and wait for Juan to speak or act\n\nI need to be careful not to have Catalina say too much or react too strongly before Juan has a chance to explain what he's trying to show her. The scene should be atmospheric and quiet, setting up for whatever lesson or moment Juan wants to create.\n\nJanuary night in Castile would be cold, but clear winter nights have the best stars. The Alcázar is in Toledo, so they'd be going outside the city walls into the countryside.\n\nCatalina's eyes widen—not with fear, but with surprise. This is not what she expected. She is accustomed to lessons delivered in chambers, to catechisms recited by firelight, to answers that come wrapped in scripture and theology.\n\n\"Outside?\" she asks. \"Now? It is night, Papa.\"\n\nBut she is already moving, sliding off the bed, reaching for the dress she wore earlier. A nurse appears in the doorway, alarmed at the activity, but you wave her away. Catalina dresses quickly, her fingers nimble despite the hour, and when you wrap the heavy cloak around her shoulders she pulls it tight, her breath misting in the cold air of the corridor.\n\nThe guards at the gate exchange glances when you pass with the princess, but they know better than to question the King. Two move to follow at a distance—you allow this, but gesture for them to remain far back. This is not a moment for armed men hovering at your elbow.\n\nThe night is clear and bitter cold, the kind of January night that turns breath to frost and makes the stars burn like scattered diamonds. Toledo sleeps behind you, a dark mass of walls and towers, as you lead Catalina along the path that winds into the hills beyond the city. She does not complain about the cold, does not ask where you are going. She simply follows, her small hand in yours, her eyes watchful.\n\nWhen you find the spot—a clearing on a hillside where the trees fall away and the sky opens above you—you spread the blankets on the frozen ground. The grass crunches beneath them, stiff with frost.\n\nCatalina stands at the edge of the blanket, looking up at you uncertainly. She has never done anything like this. The stars wheel overhead, more than she has ever seen—the palace courtyards and city streets always have too much torchlight, too many walls. Here, away from everything, the sky is infinite.\n\nShe lies down beside you, pulling the cloak tight, and looks up.\n\nFor a long moment, there is only silence. The cold. The stars. The soft sound of her breathing.\n\n\"Papa,\" she whispers, and her voice is very small. \"There are so many.\"",

Her piety roll was 7 - spiritually empty. But this doesn't mean she can never connect to faith; it means it doesn't come naturally to her, that she struggles with it. This moment could be the first crack in that emptiness, or it could show how deep it runs.\n\nI need to write Catalina's response authentically. She's almost six, brilliant, emotionally guarded, has never known her mother except through stories and a portrait. She's been crying silently - a rare vulnerability for her.

Ask more questions first\n3. Struggle to find words\n4. Feel something for the first time - or still feel nothing but want to try\n\nI think the most authentic response is somewhere between - she wants to try, she's moved by Juan's words, but she's still uncertain. She might start to speak and find it harder than she expected. This isn't a miraculous conversion moment (that would be too easy given her trait), but it could be the beginning of something - a door cracked open rather than thrown wide.\n\nI should write this as a tender, vulnerable moment.

Her breath comes in small white clouds that rise and fade.\n\nFor a long moment, she does not speak. You can see her struggling—not with the words, but with something deeper. The willingness to try something she does not understand. To speak into the dark without knowing if anyone is listening.\n\nThen, slowly, she reaches out and takes your hand. Her fingers are cold.\n\n\"I do not know how,\" she whispers. \"I do not know what to say.\"\n\nShe looks at the stars, her brow furrowed, her lips pressed together.

Her hand tightens on yours, gripping hard.\n\n\"I do not know if you can hear me,\" she says, and now there is something raw in her voice, something cracking open. \"I do not know if anyone can hear me. But Papa says you might be up there. In the bright places. And if you are...\"\n\nShe is crying again. Still silent, still refusing to sob, but the tears come faster now.\n\n\"I miss you,\" she whispers. \"I do not remember you, but I miss you. Is that strange? Can you miss someone you never knew?\"\n\nShe turns her face toward you, and in the starlight she looks so young, so lost.\n\n\"Papa, is she listening? Do you think she heard?\"",

But she might understand something she didn't before - that prayer isn't about feeling certain, it's about reaching out despite uncertainty.\n\nThe words hang in the cold air, rising like the mist of your breath toward the infinite darkness above. For a moment, there is only silence—the kind of silence that fills cathedrals, that settles over battlefields after the fighting stops, that exists in the spaces between heartbeats.\n\nCatalina does not say \"Amen.\"\n\nInstead, she turns on her side and buries her face against your chest, her small body shaking. The sobs come now—not silent anymore, but raw and broken, the sound of something that has been held too tightly for too long finally breaking free. She cries like a child, because she is a child, and for once she is not trying to be anything else.\n\nYou hold her. The stars wheel overhead, indifferent and eternal, and your daughter weeps against you for a mother she never knew, for questions she cannot answer, for a God she cannot feel.\n\nWhen the sobs finally slow, when her breathing steadies, she speaks. Her voice is thick, muffled against your cloak.\n\n\"That was different,\" she says. \"When you prayed. It was not like chapel. It was not like Sister Margarita.\" She pulls back just enough to look at you, her face blotched and tear-streaked in the starlight. \"You were not reciting. You were talking.\"\n\nShe wipes her nose with the back of her hand—an unladylike gesture that would horrify her nurses.\n\n\"I still do not know if anyone heard,\" she admits quietly. \"I still do not feel anything. Not like the priests say you should.\" She looks up at the stars again. \"But... I think I understand now. Why you pray. Even without knowing.\"\n\nShe is quiet for a moment.\n\n\"Can we come back here again sometime, Papa? Just us?\"",

I should probably ask for clarification or present candidates from both orders.\n\n3. Given what just happened with Catalina - her spiritual struggles, her inability to feel faith, the breakthrough moment under the stars - Juan is clearly looking for someone who can nurture her spiritually in a way that's different from the rote instruction she's been receiving.\n\n4. Sister Margarita is already a Dominican tertiary who teaches religious instruction and has found her calling as a storyteller. But a confessor is different - this would be a priest who can hear confession and provide spiritual guidance.\n\n5. I should narrate the morning mass scene, show the family together, and then have someone (probably Álvaro de Luna or a church official) respond to Juan's request about the confessor candidates.\n\nLet me write this scene. I'll keep it relatively short since it's transitional, and end with either presenting some candidates or indicating when candidates will be ready.\n\nThe morning dawns grey and cold, frost still clinging to the stones of the Alcázar. The family assembles in the royal chapel for the morning Mass—a smaller, more intimate space than the Cathedral, with room enough for the household but not the crowds of courtiers and petitioners.\n\nLucia arrives with Nicolás in her arms, the infant swaddled against the chill. María walks beside her, still in her widow's black, her face composed in the serene mask of practiced piety. The nurses bring the younger children: Teresa squirming, Bianca pale and quiet, Juana watching everything with those intent dark eyes. Fernando fidgets in his place, already bored before the Mass has begun.\n\nCatalina walks in last, holding the hand of her nurse. She looks tired—there are faint shadows beneath her eyes—but something is different in the way she carries herself. When she takes her place beside you, she glances up and offers a small, private smile. Nothing more. But it is enough.\n\nThe Mass proceeds. Father Tomás intones the familiar Latin, the incense rises, the responses come in their proper order. Catalina's lips move with the words, as they always do. But once, during the elevation of the Host, you see her gaze drift upward—past the altar, past the painted ceiling—as if looking for something beyond.\n\nAfterward, as the family disperses to break their fast, you draw aside Don Álvaro, who has been waiting at the chapel entrance.\n\n\"I need candidates,\" you tell him. \"A confessor for Princess Catalina. Dominican or Franciscan—someone young enough to connect with a child, wise enough to guide her, patient enough to answer questions without dismissing them as foolishness.\"\n\nÁlvaro raises an eyebrow—just slightly. He has known you long enough to hear what lies beneath the request.\n\n\"A confessor for a child not yet six, Your Majesty? She will not make her first confession until the age of reason.\"\n\nHe pauses, studying your face.\n\n\"But you are not speaking of confession alone, are you? You want a spiritual guide.

He believes a Franciscan would suit her better because she's asking deep questions that Sister Margarita (the Dominican tertiary) cannot adequately address.\n\nI should have Álvaro respond thoughtfully to this request. He knows Juan well and understands the significance of what Juan is asking. A Franciscan order is known for its emphasis on simplicity, humility, and connection with nature and creation - which might indeed suit Catalina's questioning, observant nature better than the more intellectual Dominican approach.\n\nI need to think about what Álvaro would say and how he would approach finding candidates. He might:\n1. Acknowledge the wisdom of choosing Franciscan over Dominican\n2. Ask about what qualities Juan is looking for specifically\n3. Mention potential candidates or where to look for them\n4. Perhaps express some observations about Catalina himself\n\nI should also consider the historical context - Franciscans in 15th century Castile, their reputation, their approach to spirituality vs. Dominicans (who were more associated with intellectual theology and, notably, the Inquisition).\n\nLet me craft a response that shows Álvaro's understanding and practical mind, while also opening up the conversation for Juan to elaborate on what he's looking for.\n\nÁlvaro nods slowly, his expression thoughtful. He has watched Catalina grow these past years, has seen the way she observes and catalogues, the precision with which she navigates the court even at her young age.\n\n\"A Franciscan,\" he repeats. \"Yes, I can see the wisdom in that. The Dominicans are fine theologians—brilliant, even—but their answers tend toward the scholastic. Definitions and distinctions. Summas and syllogisms.\" He pauses. \"For a child who asks why the stars shine, that approach may feel like being handed a map when she wanted to see the country.\"\n\nHe strokes his beard, considering.\n\n\"The Franciscans are different. They begin with wonder, not doctrine. Brother Francis spoke to birds and called the sun his brother. They are more comfortable with mystery—with sitting in the questions rather than rushing to resolve them.\"\n\nHe glances toward the doorway where Catalina disappeared with her nurse.\n\n\"I know of a few possibilities. There is a friar at the monastery of San Juan de los Reyes—young, perhaps thirty, said to have a gift for speaking with children. He teaches the novices and is known for his patience. Another at La Rábida, near Palos, though that is far. And I have heard talk of a Franciscan scholar recently arrived from Italy who has been preaching in Valladolid—though I know less of him.\"\n\nHe turns back to you.\n\n\"What qualities matter most, Your Majesty?

Fernando immediately tries to jump on them, but Catalina catches his arm.\n\n\"No, Fernando. We have to lie down properly. And be quiet.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\nCatalina looks at you, and you nod. She takes a breath—the deep breath of a child about to attempt something important.\n\n\"We are going to look at the stars,\" she says. \"And... and think about Mama. Our first mama. Isabel.\" She kneels on the blanket, guiding Fernando down beside her. \"She is up there, Fernando. In heaven. And when we look at the stars and think about her, it is like... like talking to her. Even though she cannot talk back.\"\n\nFernando's brow furrows. \"I do not remember her,\" he says.\n\n\"Neither do I,\" Catalina admits softly. \"But Papa does. And he says she loved us very much. She died when you were born, so you could live.\"\n\nFernando is quiet for a moment, processing this with the seriousness only a small child can bring to such matters.\n\n\"Does she know about my horse? Trueno?\"\n\nCatalina glances at you, uncertain how to answer.",

Above, the stars blaze in their silent multitudes—even more vivid tonight than the night before, the air crisp and clear.\n\nFernando's breath catches. \"There are so many,\" he whispers, unconsciously echoing his sister's words from the previous night.\n\nCatalina turns her head to look at you. In the starlight, her face is pale and serious, but there is something new there—a fragile confidence, perhaps. The knowledge that she did this once before and the world did not collapse.\n\n\"You go first, Papa,\" she says quietly. \"So Fernando can see how it is done.\" A pause. \"And so I can... remember.\"\n\nShe reaches out and takes Fernando's hand on one side.

Juan's personal intervention - the stargazing sessions, the genuine conversations about doubt and mystery\n2. Juan modeling authentic prayer (not performance)\n3. Juan validating her doubts (\"I don't know either\")\n4. Juan telling her it's okay not to feel anything yet\n5. The emotional breakthrough - crying, talking to Isabel\n6. Fernando's presence reinforcing the experience\n7. She reported feeling \"something small, like a candle very far away\"\n8. She has been given responsibility (telling siblings when they're ready)\n9. A new confessor is being sought - one who says \"I don't know\"\n10. The household at Casa de las Palomas is flourishing (Roll 80)\n11. Her natural intelligence means she can engage deeply with theology if presented properly\n12. She's only 6 - plenty of time for development\n\n**Failure Factors:**\n1. Initial piety roll of 7 - genuinely spiritually empty at core\n2. Years of performative religion have already created associations\n3. Her analytical mind may always struggle with faith\n4. She explicitly stated she doesn't \"feel\" anything during normal prayer\n5. The experience might fade - emotional moments don't always lead to lasting change\n6. Sister Margarita and Father Tomás may continue their old approaches\n7. Court religion is performative by nature\n8. Her mother's death creates a theological problem she may never resolve\n\n**Historical Context:**\nMedieval children were expected to develop faith through repetition and environment. Personal spiritual experiences were less emphasized than participation in the sacraments. However, mystics and saints often had formative childhood spiritual experiences.\n \nI'll map out potential spiritual trajectories, considering Juan's profound intervention and Catalina's core temperament. The goal is nuanced spiritual growth - not sainthood, but genuine personal faith. Her initial response shows a potential crack in her spiritual wall, suggesting hope for transformation beyond performative religious practice. The challenge lies in moving from intellectual understanding to emotional and spiritual connection.\n\nThe progression ranges from spiritual emptiness to a deeply surprising awakening, with multiple intermediate stages reflecting incremental personal growth. Juan's exceptional intervention creates a meaningful pivot point, potentially counteracting her inherently low spiritual receptivity.\n\nChaos Roll: Catalina's Spiritual Awakening\n\nThis roll determines the long-term trajectory of Catalina's spiritual development following Juan's intervention. We are not rolling for a single moment, but for whether genuine faith takes root in her soul over the coming years.\n\nSuccess Factors:\n\nJuan's authentic modeling — He showed her prayer as conversation, not performance. He admitted his own doubts and unknowing.\n\nValidation of her struggles — Being told \"it is permitted not to feel anything yet\" removed the shame and sense of brokenness.\n\nEmotional breakthrough — She wept for Isabel, spoke to her mother, and felt the words \"going somewhere.\"\n\nFirst glimmer reported — \"Something small. Like a candle very far away. But it was there.\"\n\nResponsibility given — She has been entrusted to guide her siblings to this experience when ready. Purpose often kindles faith.\n\nNew confessor being sought — A Franciscan who can say \"I do not know\" may reach her where others failed.\n\nAge and plasticity — She is not yet six. The soul is still forming.\n\nConnection to Isabel — Faith now has an emotional anchor: her mother in heaven.\n\nFailure Factors:\n\nFoundational emptiness (Piety 7) — This is her nature. The hollow place is real, not merely a lack of proper instruction.\n\nAnalytical mind — Her intelligence may always reduce mystery to problems to be solved. Faith requires surrender she may be incapable of.\n\nYears of performative religion — Chapel, catechism, and rote prayer have already created negative associations.\n\nUnresolved theodicy — \"Why did my mother die?\" is a question that breaks many faiths. She may never find peace with it.\n\nEmotional moments fade — A night under the stars is powerful, but the feeling may not survive the return to daily routine and formal religion.\n\nCourt environment — Royal piety is political performance. She will spend her life surrounded by people whose faith is calculation.\n\nBaseline Assessment:\n\nCatalina was born with a spiritual void where faith should be. Juan's intervention was extraordinary—perhaps the best possible approach for a child like her. But changing fundamental nature is difficult. The question is not whether she will become a mystic, but whether she can develop functional, genuine faith rather than remaining hollow.\n\nd100 Table: Catalina's Spiritual Journey\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-10\nThe Candle Dies — The experience fades. Within months, it becomes a pleasant memory but nothing more. Catalina remains spiritually empty, her faith forever performative. She will say the words, make the gestures, and feel nothing. The hollow place remains.\n11-25\nIntellectual Faith — She develops a scholar's appreciation for theology, Church history, and religious philosophy. She can discuss God brilliantly. But it remains in her head, never reaching her heart. She respects faith without possessing it.\n26-40\nDutiful Observance — She becomes genuinely devout in practice—regular prayer, sincere charity, faithful attendance. But the transcendent experience eludes her. She serves God without feeling His presence. A faithful servant who has never seen her master's face.\n41-55\nQuiet Growth — The seed planted under the stars takes root slowly. Over years, Catalina develops a private, personal faith—not ecstatic, not mystical, but real. She prays and sometimes feels heard. The candle grows to a steady flame, small but persistent.\n56-70\nIsabel's Gift — Her faith becomes anchored in the communion of saints. She may never feel God directly, but she feels her mother—a sense of presence, of being watched over. Through Isabel, she finds her way to genuine belief. An unusual path, but authentic.\n71-85\nThe Wondering Faith — Catalina develops a faith built not on certainty but on holy curiosity. Her questions become prayers. Her doubts become doorways. She becomes one of those rare souls who worship through inquiry, finding God in the asking rather than the answering.\n86-95\nTransformation — Against all expectation, genuine spiritual awakening occurs. The empty place fills. Catalina develops deep, authentic faith that surprises everyone who knew her as a child. She becomes known for her piety—not performed, but radiant.\n96-100\nThe Unexpected Path — Something unforeseen emerges. Perhaps mystical experiences. Perhaps a religious vocation considered. Perhaps she becomes a reformer, a founder, a saint's advocate. Her spiritual journey takes a turn no one predicted, shaping not just her life but the faith of those around her.\n\nPlease roll d100.",

But some things cannot be taught or given. The hollow place remains.\n\nI should narrate this outcome with appropriate weight - it's sad, but not tragic. Many people live good lives with intellectual rather than experiential faith. It's just... not what Juan hoped for.\n\nRoll: 18 — Intellectual Faith\n\nThe candle Catalina felt that night—small, distant, flickering—does not die. But neither does it grow into the flame Juan hoped for.\n\nIn the months that follow, Catalina embraces what her father taught her. She prays. She speaks to Isabel under the stars when Juan takes her there. She welcomes Brother Hernando when he arrives—a gentle Franciscan with patient eyes who answers her questions honestly and is not afraid to say \"I do not know.\"\n\nShe learns. God, she learns.\n\nBy age eight, Catalina can discuss the nature of the Trinity with a clarity that startles visiting bishops. By ten, she has read Augustine's Confessions and asks Brother Hernando why the saint's doubts sound so much like her own. By twelve, she debates theodicy with Dominican scholars and holds her own—not with passion, but with precision, dissecting arguments like a surgeon dissecting flesh.\n\nShe becomes, in her way, genuinely devout in practice. She attends Mass faithfully. She gives to the poor. She observes the fasts and the feasts. She can recite the lives of the saints with accuracy and genuine appreciation for their sacrifices.\n\nBut the transcendent moment never comes.\n\nShe waits for it. For years, she waits. She returns to the hillside, sometimes alone, sometimes with siblings she has deemed ready. She teaches Fernando and Teresa and eventually Juana how to speak to the stars, how to reach for Isabel, how to pray with feeling rather than rote recitation.\n\nAnd they feel things she does not.\n\nShe watches Fernando weep with genuine religious emotion during his first Communion. She sees Teresa's face transform during prayer, touched by something invisible and real. She observes Juana—strange, magnetic Juana—speak of God with the terrifying certainty of one who knows.\n\nCatalina feels none of it.\n\nOne evening, when she is fourteen, she sits with Juan in the solar after vespers. The conversation has turned to faith, as it sometimes does between them.\n\n\"I have tried, Papa,\" she says quietly. There is no self-pity in her voice, only calm acceptance. \"For years, I have tried. I have read the mystics. I have fasted. I have prayed until my knees ached. Brother Hernando says I understand the faith better than half the priests in Toledo.\"\n\nShe looks at her hands.\n\n\"But understanding is not the same as feeling. I can describe fire perfectly—its heat, its light, the way it consumes fuel and produces ash. But I have never been burned by it. I stand before the hearth and feel only... warmth. Pleasant. Distant.\"\n\nShe meets your eyes, and in her gaze is something that has taken years to settle: not bitterness, not grief, but a kind of peace.\n\n\"I will serve God faithfully, Papa. I will be a good queen, if that is my path. I will raise my children in the Church and teach them what you taught me under the stars. I will defend the faith with my mind, since I cannot defend it with my heart.\"\n\nShe takes your hand—the same hand she held on that frozen hillside when she was five years old.\n\n\"But I will never feel what you feel. What Fernando feels. What even little Juana feels.\" A pause. \"I have made my peace with it. The hollow place is simply... part of me. Perhaps God made me this way for a reason I cannot understand. Perhaps my faith is meant to be a choice, not a feeling. A discipline, not a gift.\"\n\nShe smiles—small, wry, entirely her own.\n\n\"Brother Hernando says there is a term for people like me. Fides quaerens intellectum. Faith seeking understanding. He says some of the greatest theologians were men who thought their way to God because they could not feel their way.\"\n\nShe squeezes your hand.\n\n\"Thank you for trying, Papa. That night under the stars—I have never forgotten it. I never will. It did not give me what you hoped. But it gave me something else.\"\n\n\"What?\" you ask.\n\n\"You,\" she says simply. \"It gave me you. And that is enough.\"",

Fernando has gathered an audience: Catalina watches from a stone bench with Bianca beside her, wrapped in furs. Pedro and Gonzalito stand nearby, wooden swords in hand. Little Teresa toddles about collecting pebbles, supervised by a nurse.\n\nFernando stands in the center, wearing a pot helm far too large for his head—likely borrowed from the guardhouse—and wielding a wooden sword with tremendous enthusiasm. He has draped a blanket over his shoulders as a cloak.\n\n\"I am the King of Jerusalem!\" he announces, his voice muffled by the helm. \"And you are the Saracens! Prepare to be vanquished!\"\n\nHe charges at Pedro, swinging wildly. Pedro—a year older and the son of a soldier—sidesteps easily and gives Fernando a gentle tap on the shoulder.\n\n\"You're dead, Your Highness,\" Pedro says, grinning.\n\n\"I am NOT dead!\" Fernando protests, spinning around. \"Kings cannot die! I have— I have holy protection!\"\n\nHe swings again. This time Gonzalito joins in, and within moments Fernando is flailing between them, his sword meeting only air while their wooden blades tap his arms, his legs, his back. He grows increasingly frustrated, his swings becoming wider, clumsier.\n\n\"That is not FAIR!\" he shouts, throwing down his sword. \"You are supposed to fight me ONE AT A TIME!\"",

This is a sweet fatherly moment where Juan is trying to engage with Fernando's play and perhaps gently teach him something about martial matters.\n\nI should narrate Fernando's reaction and continue the scene, keeping in mind:\n- Fernando is 4.5 years old\n- He has a martial aptitude roll of 9 (reluctant - cannot fight)\n- He is brilliant (intelligence 82), has a gift for languages, magnificent physical presence\n- He wants to be a knight but may never be suited for it\n- Juan is trying to see if he can awaken martial interest in Fernando\n\nI should show Fernando's enthusiasm but also perhaps subtle hints of his unsuitability for actual combat, while keeping the scene light and playful since they're just children playing.\n\nFernando's frustration vanishes instantly, replaced by delight. From his new vantage point atop the cart—a rickety thing used for hauling firewood, now transformed into a fortress—he surveys his domain with the gravity of a seasoned commander.\n\n\"My castle!\" he declares, adjusting the oversized helm so he can see properly. \"Yes! And you—\" he points at Pedro and Gonzalito with his wooden sword, \"—you are the enemy army! You must siege me now!\"\n\nPedro and Gonzalito exchange glances, then gamely take up positions around the cart, crouching behind imaginary fortifications.\n\n\"We demand your surrender, Your Majesty!\" Gonzalito calls out in his best villain voice. \"Give us your treasure!\"\n\n\"NEVER!\" Fernando stamps his foot on the cart, making it wobble. \"I have— I have—\" He looks at you, suddenly uncertain. \"Papa, what do castles have? To fight enemies?\"\n\nCatalina speaks up from her bench, unable to resist: \"Walls. Towers. A gatehouse with a portcullis. Murder holes for dropping stones and hot oil. Arrow slits for crossbowmen. A moat, if you are near water. Provisions for a long siege—grain, salting barrels, a well within the walls.\"\n\nFernando stares at her, overwhelmed.\n\n\"I have ALL of those things!\" he announces, waving vaguely at the cart.\n\nPedro has begun creeping closer, wooden sword raised. Gonzalito circles from the other side. Fernando sees them and raises his own sword, but there is something in his stance—a hesitation, a slight step backward rather than forward—that speaks to instinct rather than training.\n\n\"Papa,\" he whispers urgently, tugging at your sleeve. \"What do I do? There are two of them!\"",

The user is trying to engage Fernando in martial play, but Fernando has a martial aptitude of 9 (reluctant - cannot fight). This scene might naturally reveal some of his limitations while still being a warm family moment.\n\nBianca's grey-green eyes—so like her mother's—widen as you lift her from the bench. She is small for three, delicate-boned, her pale face framed by dark hair. She does not protest, but her arms tighten around your neck.\n\n\"Papa?\" she asks uncertainly. \"What are we doing?\"\n\n\"You are defending the castle,\" you tell her, setting her gently on the cart beside Fernando. \"With your brother.\"\n\nFernando looks at his new ally with obvious skepticism. \"But she is little,\" he says. \"And she does not have a sword.\"\n\nCatalina is already moving, pulling a stick from the kindling pile near the wall. She brushes it off and presents it to Bianca with exaggerated formality.\n\n\"Your weapon, my lady.\"\n\nBianca takes the stick and studies it with the intense seriousness only small children can muster. Then she looks at Pedro and Gonzalito, who have paused their siege to watch this development.\n\nSomething shifts in her face.\n\n\"They want to take our castle?\" she asks, her voice very small but suddenly sharp.\n\n\"They do,\" you confirm.\n\nBianca's delicate features harden into something unexpectedly fierce. She plants her feet on the cart—wobbling slightly—and raises her stick like a spear.\n\n\"NO,\" she announces. \"This is MY castle. MINE and Fernando's. Go AWAY.\"\n\nThe intensity in her voice startles everyone, including Fernando. Gonzalito actually takes a step back.\n\n\"She is frightening,\" he whispers to Pedro.\n\nFernando, emboldened by his sister's sudden ferocity, raises his own sword. \"You heard her! This is OUR castle! You cannot have it!\"\n\nBut even now, standing beside Bianca's unexpected fire, Fernando positions himself slightly behind her—not leading the defense, but supporting it.",

His gifts are elsewhere.\n\nI'll narrate a scene where the children play, and the dynamics reveal character. Fernando might try to negotiate rather than fight, or find ways to \"win\" that don't involve direct combat. Bianca's volatility might show - she burns hot but then tires quickly (fragile constitution).\n\nThe siege of the firewood cart unfolds with all the drama and chaos of childhood warfare.\n\nPedro leads the first assault, charging with his wooden sword raised. Fernando moves to meet him—but Bianca is faster, lunging forward with her stick and shrieking like a small, furious falcon. The sound is so startling that Pedro stumbles, and Bianca jabs him in the chest.\n\n\"You are DEAD!\" she screams. \"DEAD DEAD DEAD!\"\n\n\"I am not—\" Pedro starts, but Bianca is already turning on Gonzalito, who has attempted to flank the cart. She swings wildly, her small body trembling with exertion.\n\nFernando, meanwhile, has not moved from his position. He watches his sister's assault with something between admiration and bewilderment. When Gonzalito dodges Bianca and comes at him directly, Fernando raises his sword—but instead of swinging, he speaks.\n\n\"Wait!\" he calls out. \"I offer you terms! If you surrender now, I will make you a duke!\"\n\nGonzalito pauses, confused. \"A duke?\"\n\n\"A duke of... of somewhere. A good place. With horses.\"\n\n\"Fernando, you are supposed to FIGHT him,\" Catalina calls from her bench, half-exasperated, half-amused.\n\n\"Kings do not always fight,\" Fernando replies with surprising dignity. \"Sometimes they make treaties. Papa makes treaties.\"\n\nBianca, however, has no interest in diplomacy. She launches herself at Gonzalito with renewed fury—but the effort is too much. Halfway through her charge, she stumbles, her face suddenly pale. She sits down hard on the cart, breathing heavily.\n\n\"I am tired,\" she announces, and promptly lies down on the wooden slats, closing her eyes.\n\nThe siege pauses. Everyone looks at Bianca with concern.\n\nFernando kneels beside her, his sword forgotten. \"Bianca? Are you well?\" He touches her forehead gently, then looks up at you, worry creasing his young face. \"Papa, she is cold.\"",

Fernando naturally gravitates toward diplomacy and negotiation rather than combat. This is who he is.\n\nI should have Fernando explain his reasoning in a way that reveals his character - his intelligence, his preference for words over swords, his understanding of how power actually works. But I should also show his awareness that this makes him different from what's expected of a prince and future king.\n\nI need to be careful not to have Fernando be too articulate for a 4.5 year old, but he is noted as brilliant with a gift for languages, so some precocity is appropriate. Still, he should sound like a very bright young child, not an adult.\n\nFernando walks beside you through the corridors, his wooden sword still clutched in one hand. A nurse has already swept Bianca up and carried her ahead—the child needs warmth and rest, nothing more, but Fernando keeps glancing in the direction she was taken.\n\nAt your question, he looks up at you, the oversized helm now pushed back on his head like a ridiculous iron halo.\n\n\"Pedro's father was a soldier,\" he says, as if this explains everything. \"And Gonzalito climbs better than anyone. I cannot beat them with swords, Papa. I have tried. Many times.\" There is no self-pity in his voice, just a child's frank assessment of reality. \"But if Gonzalito were my duke, he would not need to fight me. He would fight for me. And then I would win.\"\n\nHe furrows his brow, working through the logic.\n\n\"You have three crowns, Papa. Did you fight everyone who wore them before? Or did you make them want to give them to you?\"\n\nHe stumbles slightly on an uneven flagstone, catches himself, and continues without missing a beat.\n\n\"Father Tomás says King Solomon was the wisest king because he did not fight wars. He made everyone want to be his friend instead. And he built a great temple.\" Fernando looks up at you earnestly. \"I would rather build a temple than fight a war. Wars hurt people. Temples make people happy.\"\n\nHe pauses at the entrance to the family's chambers, his small face serious.\n\n\"Is that wrong, Papa? To not want to fight?\"",

He has a gift for languages (76) and sincere piety (50). He's bold in temperament (64).\n\nThis is a moment for Fernando to express his inner nature. He's four and a half years old, so his answer should be childlike but also reveal something deeper about his character. He's not a coward - his temperament is bold. But something about violence itself doesn't sit right with him.\n\nI should have Fernando answer honestly, in a child's way, revealing that fundamental aspect of his nature - that he simply doesn't have the martial instinct, perhaps even finds violence distressing in some way. This should feel authentic to a child who is brilliant and thoughtful but simply lacks the warrior's heart.\n\nFernando is quiet for a long moment. He pulls off the oversized helm and holds it in his hands, turning it over, studying the crude iron as if it holds answers.\n\n\"When I hit Pedro with the sword,\" he says slowly, \"even though it is wood, even though it is play... I see his face. The moment before it lands. He flinches. He expects it to hurt.\" He looks up at you. \"And I do not want to make that face happen. Even in play. Even when I know it does not really hurt.\"\n\nHe sets the helm down on a bench, running his fingers over the dented surface.\n\n\"Gonzalito does not mind.

And by the time I make myself do it anyway, Pedro has already hit me.\"\n\nHe looks down at his hands—hands that are already showing the promise of his physical inheritance, broad and strong for a boy not yet five.\n\n\"I am not afraid, Papa. I do not think I am afraid.\" His brow furrows. \"When Bianca charged at Pedro, I wanted to protect her. I wanted to. But my arms would not... they would not go. It is like they belong to someone else when there is fighting.\"\n\nHe meets your eyes, and there is something raw there—a child trying to understand himself and not quite succeeding.\n\n\"Is there something wrong with me, Papa?

He may intellectualize rather than act\n5. The gap between understanding and doing\n\nThis is a formative moment, but one game won't transform him entirely. Let me create a realistic table.\n\nChaos Roll: Fernando and the Game of Protection\n\nThis roll determines how the game unfolds and whether Juan's approach begins to kindle a protective instinct in Fernando—not martial prowess, but the willingness to stand between those he loves and danger.\n\nSuccess Factors:\n\nReframing of violence — Juan has presented fighting as protection, not aggression. This aligns with Fernando's empathetic nature.\n\nEmotional stakes — Defending his sisters is different from abstract combat. Bianca and Juana are real to him.\n\nRole models present — Pedro demonstrates duty and protection naturally, providing an example Fernando can observe.\n\nRecent bonding — The night under the stars has strengthened Fernando's sense of family connection.\n\nIntelligent child — Fernando (Intelligence 82) can grasp abstract concepts and apply them.\n\nBold temperament (64) — He is not a coward; his reluctance is about harming, not about fear.\n\nCreative game structure — Rotating roles lets Fernando experience both sides and find his place.\n\nFailure Factors:\n\nDeep-seated reluctance (Martial 9) — His instinct to stop before striking is fundamental, not easily overcome.\n\nPreference for negotiation — He may still try to talk his way out rather than act.\n\nPhysical hesitation — Understanding protection intellectually is different from doing it in the moment.\n\nYoung age — He is not yet five. Instincts are forming but malleable in unpredictable ways.\n\nd100 Table: The Game of Protection\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-10\nWithdrawal — Fernando cannot bring himself to participate meaningfully. He hangs back, offers truces, or finds excuses to leave. The game reinforces his disconnect from physical defense.\n11-25\nConfusion — Fernando tries but remains uncertain. He defends hesitantly when it is his turn, attacks reluctantly when required. No clear instinct emerges. The game is just a game.\n26-40\nIntellectual Understanding — Fernando grasps the concept but cannot translate it to action. He explains afterwards why protection matters, but in the moment, he still freezes. Head and body remain separated.\n41-55\nA Glimmer — Something small shifts. In one moment—perhaps when Bianca is \"threatened\"—Fernando acts without thinking. It surprises everyone, including himself. A seed planted, though fragile.\n56-70\nThe Protector Awakens — When defending his sisters, Fernando finds something he lacked in pure combat: purpose. He still cannot attack, but he can stand between. A meaningful distinction emerges.\n71-85\nUnexpected Discovery — Fernando discovers his own way to protect. Perhaps he organizes the defense, directs Pedro, or finds creative solutions. Leadership rather than swordsmanship. His gifts find application.\n86-95\nTransformation — The game unlocks something. Fernando defends Bianca with a ferocity that shocks everyone—not violent, but resolute. He will never be a warrior, but he has found his courage.\n96-100\nThe Shield Prince — Something extraordinary emerges. Fernando's protective instinct proves deeper than anyone knew. He becomes the children's natural guardian—not through strength, but through unwavering presence. A new identity begins to form.\n\nPlease roll d100.",

Juana has finally stopped trying to eat her crown and is staring at the combat with unsettling intensity.\n\nFernando hangs back, sword in hand, watching.\n\n\"Fernando! Help me!\" Gonzalito calls, circling around to flank Pedro. \"Attack from the other side!\"\n\nFernando moves—but slowly, uncertainly. By the time he reaches striking distance, Pedro has already driven Gonzalito back again.

Fernando tries again. The same result.\n\nThen you rotate the roles. Gonzalito defends. Pedro attacks. Fernando is told to help Pedro assault the princesses.\n\nHe cannot do it.\n\nHe stands there, wooden sword at his side, watching Pedro batter at Gonzalito's defenses, and his feet will not move toward his sisters. Bianca catches his eye and—playing her role perfectly—gives him a look of such regal disappointment that Fernando flushes red.\n\n\"Fernando,\" Catalina calls from her bench, \"you are supposed to be the villain.\"\n\n\"I know,\" he says miserably. \"I know.\"\n\nThe third rotation changes everything.\n\nThis time Fernando defends.

His sword comes up, but not to strike. To block. To buy time.\n\n\"Pedro!\" he shouts. \"The treasury! Gonzalito is going for the treasury!\"\n\nIt is a lie. Gonzalito is nowhere near the treasure chest. But Pedro's head turns instinctively at the warning, and in that moment of confusion, Fernando grabs Bianca's arm.\n\n\"Move behind the cart! Now! Juana too!\"\n\nBianca, startled out of her princess pose, scrambles to obey. The nurse scoops up Juana. Fernando backs toward them, keeping his sword raised—not attacking, just present. A barrier.\n\n\"That is not fair!\" Gonzalito protests. \"You cannot just move them!\"\n\n\"Why not?\" Fernando asks, genuinely puzzled. \"You are trying to capture them. I am trying to keep them safe. I am keeping them safe.\"\n\nPedro lowers his sword, frowning. \"But the fight—\"\n\n\"The fight is not the point,\" Fernando says. And there is something in his voice now—a certainty that was not there before. \"The princesses are the point. If they are safe, I win. Even if you beat me with swords, if they escape, I win.\"\n\nHe looks at you, seeking confirmation.\n\nGonzalito throws up his hands. \"He is making up rules!\"\n\nBut Pedro is quiet, thinking. The son of a soldier recognizes something.\n\n\"No,\" Pedro says slowly. \"He is right. My father says the same thing. The objective is what matters. Killing enemies means nothing if you lose what you were protecting.\"\n\nThe game continues, and Fernando transforms it.\n\nHe stops trying to fight and starts commanding. When he defends, he positions Pedro as his sword arm and directs Gonzalito to guard the flanks. He creates signals—a whistle for danger, a hand gesture for \"move the princesses.\" He sacrifices himself willingly, letting attackers \"kill\" him while his allies spirit Bianca and Juana to safety.\n\n\"The king is dead, but the princesses live!\" he announces cheerfully after one such sacrifice. \"That is a victory!\"\n\nWhen he attacks, he does not charge. He sends Pedro in first, then coordinates with Gonzalito to create distractions. He talks constantly—identifying weaknesses, calling out positions, adjusting tactics on the fly.\n\n\"Gonzalito, go left—no, your other left—Pedro, watch his sword arm, he always drops it before he swings—\"\n\nBy the end of the afternoon, the game has evolved into something none of the children have played before. Fernando never lands a blow. He never needs to. He is everywhere and nowhere, the voice that organizes, the mind that plans, the presence that holds the defense together.\n\nCatalina watches from her bench, her expression unreadable.\n\nBianca, exhausted but exhilarated, tugs at your sleeve.\n\n\"Papa,\" she whispers, \"Fernando is good at this. But he is not fighting at all.\"\n\nThat evening, Fernando finds you before dinner. His face is flushed with the day's exertion, but his eyes are bright—not with battle-fever, but with the glow of discovery.\n\n\"Papa,\" he says, \"I think I understand now. About protecting.\"\n\nHe sits beside you, still catching his breath.\n\n\"I cannot swing a sword like Pedro. I never will. But Pedro listens to me. Gonzalito too. When I see where the danger is and tell them, they can stop it. And when I move Bianca before the danger reaches her, she never needs saving at all.\" He looks up at you. \"Is that... is that a kind of fighting too?\"",

      "text": "I don't think I need a roll for this unless the user asks - this seems more like scene-setting. Let me write the scene and see where it goes naturally, letting Fernando react as a child would. The user specifically said to let Fernando react as a child would and go with the flow.\n\nMedieval ball games that would be appropriate:\n- La soule - a rough folk football game\n- Calcio storico - Italian, but more organized\n- Simple throwing/catching games\n- A version of handball\n\nI'll describe a rough-and-tumble ball game in the courtyard and see how Fernando handles it.\n\nThe morning breaks cold but bright, a rare winter sun casting long shadows across the courtyard. You have the servants clear a space and bring out a leather ball—stuffed with wool, about the size of a man's head, the kind used for la soule in the villages, though you intend something less brutal than the peasant game.\n\nThe children gather, curious. Pedro and Gonzalito eye the ball with immediate understanding; this is familiar territory. Fernando stands slightly apart, his breath misting in the cold air, watching.\n\n\"The rules are simple,\" you announce. \"Two teams. Get the ball to your end of the courtyard. You may carry it, throw it, kick it. You may not strike with fists or feet—but you may grab, push, and tackle to take the ball.\"\n\nFernando's eyes widen slightly at the word tackle.\n\nCatalina has joined today, wrapped in a warm cloak. \"I will keep score,\" she announces, settling onto her usual bench. Teresa sits beside her, and Bianca—still tired from yesterday—watches from a nurse's arms.\n\nYou divide the teams: Pedro and Fernando against Gonzalito and yourself. This puts Fernando with the strongest fighter, and against his father—someone he will not be afraid to challenge.\n\n\"Ready?\" you ask.\n\nPedro crouches, eager. Gonzalito bounces on his toes. Fernando stands very still, his jaw set with determination that does not quite hide his uncertainty.\n\nYou drop the ball in the center of the courtyard.",

Bold temperament (64) - He's not a coward, just reluctant to harm\n6. Intelligence (82) - He can understand the purpose of the exercise\n7. Physical presence (87) - He has a magnificent physical frame, he's not weak\n8. Father's encouragement - Juan is actively trying to draw him out\n\nFailure Factors:\n1. Martial aptitude (9) - Deep reluctance to physical confrontation\n2. Young age - Not yet five, physical contact can be scary\n3. Previous patterns - He's used to hanging back\n4. Fear of failure - He knows he's not good at physical things compared to Pedro\n\nThe outcomes should range from:\n- Complete withdrawal/fear\n- Hesitant participation\n- Gradual engagement\n- Finding his own way to participate\n- Genuine breakthrough in physical confidence\n\nLet me draft the table:\n\nChaos Roll: Fernando and Physical Play\n\nThis roll determines whether Fernando can overcome his hesitance toward physical contact—not to become a warrior, but to develop the basic confidence that a king needs when standing among soldiers, negotiating from strength, or simply refusing to be intimidated.\n\nSuccess Factors:\n\nSafe environment — This is play, not combat. His father is present and holding back.\n\nTeam structure — Pedro is his ally, not his opponent. Fernando can lean on his strength.\n\nYesterday's breakthrough — He discovered he can contribute through leadership. Confidence carries forward.\n\nPhysical inheritance — Fernando has magnificent physical presence (87). His body is capable; only his mind holds him back.\n\nBold temperament (64) — He is not a coward. His reluctance is specific to harming others, not to all physical contact.\n\nDifferent context — A ball game is not sword fighting. There is no pretense of violence, only competition.\n\nFather's participation — Being tackled by Papa is different from being tackled by peers. It normalizes contact.\n\nFailure Factors:\n\nDeep-seated reluctance (Martial 9) — Physical confrontation of any kind may trigger the same freeze response.\n\nYoung age — He is not yet five. Being knocked down can be frightening regardless of context.\n\nComparison to peers — Pedro and Gonzalito are naturally physical. Fernando may feel inadequate and withdraw.\n\nOverthinking — His brilliant mind may analyze rather than act, keeping him hesitant.\n\nd100 Table: The Ball Game\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-10\nWithdrawal — Fernando cannot engage. Every time contact approaches, he flinches away or passes the ball before anyone can reach him. He ends the game frustrated and ashamed, more convinced than ever that physical endeavors are not for him.\n11-20\nOverwhelmed — Fernando tries, but the first hard contact—a tackle from you or a collision with Gonzalito—sends him to the ground in tears. Not injured, but shaken. The game ends early. A setback that will need gentle recovery.\n21-35\nTentative Participation — Fernando plays but avoids contact whenever possible. He passes quickly, hangs back, lets Pedro do the physical work. He is present but not truly engaged. No progress, but no harm done.\n36-50\nGradual Warming — Fernando starts hesitant but slowly engages more as the game continues. By the end, he has absorbed a few bumps without complaint, though he still avoids initiating contact. A small step forward.\n51-65\nFinding His Role — Fernando discovers he can contribute without being the battering ram. He positions himself cleverly, receives passes, uses his size to shield the ball. He takes contact when necessary and does not crumble. Quiet competence emerges.\n66-80\nUnexpected Grit — Something clicks. Fernando takes a tackle—perhaps from you—goes down hard, and gets back up with determination rather than tears. He begins to seek the ball rather than avoid it. A genuine shift in confidence.\n81-90\nThe Prince Stands Firm — Fernando surprises everyone, including himself. He does not become aggressive, but he becomes solid. When Gonzalito tries to push past him, Fernando plants his feet and holds. When you tackle him, he laughs and demands the ball back. Physical contact loses its power to intimidate.\n91-95\nJoyful Discovery — Fernando finds genuine pleasure in the physical play. Not in dominance or victory, but in the simple exhilaration of bodies in motion, of striving and struggling. He will never love combat, but he has learned to love competition.\n96-100\nThe Magnificent Presence Awakens — Fernando's physical gifts (87) begin to manifest. He is only four, but there are moments in the game when his frame, his stance, his sheer presence give even the older boys pause. A glimpse of the man he might become—not a warrior, but someone no one would dare to dismiss.\n\nPlease roll d100.",

      "text": "The ball hits the frozen ground and bounces once. Pedro is fastest—he scoops it up and tucks it under his arm, already scanning for Fernando. Gonzalito charges at him. You hang back, watching, letting the boys establish the rhythm of the game.\n\nPedro dodges Gonzalito's first grab and throws the ball to Fernando.\n\nFernando catches it. For a moment, he freezes—you can see the old hesitation, the instinct to pass it away before anyone reaches him. Gonzalito is already running toward him, arms outstretched.\n\nThen something shifts.\n\nFernando does not throw the ball. He runs.\n\nIt is clumsy at first—he holds the ball wrong, his legs pump awkwardly, and Gonzalito is faster. But Fernando does not stop. When Gonzalito reaches him, Fernando tries to spin away, fails, and goes down in a tangle of limbs and wool and cold earth.\n\nGonzalito emerges with the ball, triumphant.\n\nFernando lies on his back, staring at the winter sky. For a heartbeat, you think he might cry.\n\nThen he laughs.\n\nIt is a sound you have rarely heard from him—not the polite chuckle of a prince acknowledging a jest, but a genuine, breathless, delighted laugh. He rolls onto his stomach, pushes himself up, and chases after Gonzalito with a grin splitting his face.\n\n\"Give it back!\" he shouts, and there is joy in his voice.\n\nThe game transforms.\n\nFernando still cannot match Pedro's speed or Gonzalito's scrappy determination. But he stops caring. He throws himself into collisions he cannot win. He falls, rolls, rises, falls again. His fine clothes are smeared with mud and frost. His hair is wild. His cheeks are red with cold and exertion.\n\nYou tackle him once—gently, but firmly, bringing him down with your arms around his waist. He hits the ground with a grunt, the ball squirting free, and when you release him, he is already scrambling after it.\n\n\"Too slow, Papa!\" he calls over his shoulder.\n\nPedro stares at his prince with something like wonder.\n\n\"He is different today,\" Gonzalito mutters, half-admiring, half-annoyed, as Fernando intercepts a pass meant for you and charges toward the far end of the courtyard.\n\nHe does not score. Gonzalito catches him from behind, and they tumble together in a heap. But Fernando emerges laughing again, slapping Gonzalito on the back.\n\n\"Good tackle! You are fast!\"\n\nThe game continues until the children are exhausted, until breath comes in ragged gasps and legs tremble with effort. The score is forgotten—if anyone was keeping it. What matters is the mud on Fernando's face, the brightness in his eyes, the way he keeps asking \"Again? One more?\"\n\nWhen you finally call an end, Fernando collapses onto the cold ground, chest heaving, staring up at the pale winter sun.\n\n\"Papa,\" he says between breaths, \"that was wonderful.\"\n\nPedro sits beside him, equally winded. \"You did well, Your Highness. You held onto the ball longer than I thought you would.\"\n\n\"I fell down a lot,\" Fernando says.\n\n\"Everyone falls down,\" Pedro replies. \"My father says the measure of a soldier is not how often he falls, but how fast he gets up.\"\n\nFernando considers this. \"I got up fast.\"\n\n\"You did.\"\n\nThat evening, Fernando finds you again. He has been bathed and changed, but there is still a smudge of dirt behind his ear that the servants missed. His body must ache from the unaccustomed exertion, but he moves with a new ease—a looseness in his shoulders that was not there before.\n\n\"Papa,\" he says, settling beside you by the fire, \"I think I understand something new.\"\n\nHe stares into the flames, searching for words.\n\n\"When Gonzalito tackled me the first time, I thought it would be terrible. I thought I would hate it. But then I was on the ground, and I was not hurt, and I thought... is that all?\" He looks at you. \"And then it was not frightening anymore. It was just... part of the game. Like falling off Trueno when I am learning to ride. It happens, and then you get up.\"\n\nHe pulls his knees to his chest, wrapping his arms around them.\n\n\"I still do not want to hurt people, Papa. When Pedro and Gonzalito hit each other with swords, even wooden ones, I see them wince. I do not want to make anyone wince.\" He pauses. \"But being hit... that is different. That is just me. And I can decide not to be afraid of it.\"\n\nHe looks up at you, and there is something new in his eyes—not the hunger for battle that marks born warriors, but a quiet confidence. The knowledge that his body can take what the world gives and keep moving.\n\n\"Can we play again tomorrow?\"",

But their fathers serve the crown. They belong to us, in a way.\" He frowns, not in disapproval but in concentration. \"Boys from the city... they would just be boys. Bakers' sons. Smiths' sons.

Potential for mockery or rejection - city boys may resent a prince \"playing\" at being common\n7. Safety concerns - guards hovering could ruin the atmosphere\n\nLet me draft a table that covers the range of outcomes from disaster to extraordinary success.\n\nChaos Roll: Fernando and the City Boys\n\nThis roll determines how Fernando's attempt to befriend common children develops over time—not a single afternoon, but the pattern that emerges over weeks and months of play.\n\nSuccess Factors:\n\nRecent breakthroughs — Fernando has discovered joy in physical play and confidence in his own body. He approaches this with momentum.\n\nNatural empathy — His reluctance to harm others translates to genuine kindness. He does not look down on those of lower station.\n\nIntelligence (82) — He can read social situations and adapt his behavior to put others at ease.\n\nGift for languages (76) — Communication is his strength. He knows how to talk to people.\n\nPhysical presence (87) — Even young, there is something about Fernando that commands attention without intimidation.\n\nCasa de las Palomas experience — He has already learned to bond across rank with Pedro, Gonzalito, Lucía, and Inés.\n\nBold temperament (64) — He is willing to try, to risk awkwardness, to push through discomfort.\n\nRoyal support — Juan has explicitly encouraged this. Guards and servants will not interfere.\n\nFailure Factors:\n\nClass barriers — 15th century Castile has rigid social hierarchies. Common boys may be too frightened or awed to play naturally.\n\nYoung age — Fernando is not yet five. Social navigation across class lines is difficult for any child.\n\nCourt interference — Despite Juan's support, nobles or servants may subtly discourage \"inappropriate\" mingling.\n\nResentment — Some common boys may resent a prince \"playing\" at being ordinary. They live lives he cannot understand.\n\nFernando's own uncertainty — He asked the right questions, but asking and doing are different things.\n\nSafety concerns — Guards must be present, however discreetly. Their presence may poison the atmosphere.\n\nJealousy among existing companions — Pedro and Gonzalito have worked hard for Fernando's friendship. New boys may create tension.\n\nd100 Table: The Prince and the City Boys\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-5\nDisaster — The experiment fails badly. Common boys either flee in terror, mock the prince behind his back, or are so stiff and formal that no connection forms. Fernando is hurt and withdraws. The attempt is not repeated, and he learns to keep his distance from those outside his station.\n6-15\nRejection — The city boys come, but they do not warm to Fernando. They see only the crown, the guards, the gulf between their worlds. The games are awkward, forced. Fernando tries his best but cannot bridge the gap. He concludes, sadly, that perhaps some walls cannot be crossed.\n16-25\nSuperficial Contact — Some boys come and play, but the relationships remain shallow. They are polite, careful, never quite real. Fernando gains acquaintances but not friends. He learns that wearing a crown means some doors close even as others open.\n26-40\nMixed Results — A few boys warm to Fernando; others remain distant. The games are sometimes joyful, sometimes awkward. Fernando learns that people are individuals—some can see past rank, others cannot. A useful lesson, if bittersweet.\n41-55\nGradual Acceptance — It takes time—weeks, perhaps months—but slowly the barriers thin. The city boys stop bowing every time Fernando speaks. Laughter becomes genuine. Real friendships begin to form, fragile but authentic.\n56-70\nThe Prince's Touch — Fernando's natural gifts shine through. His kindness, his curiosity, his willingness to fall down and get back up—these qualities win hearts. The city boys come to see Fernando, not just the prince. Word spreads that the heir of Castile is \"not like other nobles.\"\n71-85\nBeloved Among the Common — Fernando becomes genuinely popular with the city children. They seek him out, not from obligation but desire. He learns their names, their families, their dreams. They teach him things no tutor could—the rhythms of common life, the concerns of ordinary people. A prince who understands his people begins to form.\n86-95\nThe People's Prince — Something remarkable emerges. Fernando moves between worlds with an ease that surprises everyone. Noble children and common children play together in his presence, the barriers softened by his example. Stories spread through Toledo of the young prince who treats a baker's son as a friend. The seeds of a legend are planted.\n96-100\nA New Kind of King — Fernando's gift for connection proves extraordinary. He does not merely befriend common boys—he understands them, speaks their language (literal and figurative), earns their fierce loyalty. When he walks through Toledo's streets, children call his name with genuine affection. The foundations are laid for a reign unlike any Castile has known—a king who is loved not because he is mighty, but because he is known.\n\nPlease roll d100.",

      "text": "This should be a positive outcome but not extraordinary - a solid success showing Fernando's character shining through and building genuine connections with common children.\n\nRoll: 57 — The Prince's Touch\n\nThe first attempts are awkward.\n\nA handful of boys are brought to the Alcázar courtyard—sons of merchants and craftsmen, selected by the servants for their good behavior and clean faces. They arrive scrubbed and terrified, bowing so deeply their foreheads nearly touch the cobblestones. When Fernando approaches with the leather ball, they flinch.\n\n\"Do you want to play?\" Fernando asks.\n\nThey stare at him as if he has spoken Greek.\n\nThe game that follows is painful to watch. The city boys pass the ball to Fernando immediately whenever they touch it, as if holding it in his presence were a crime. They refuse to tackle him—refuse even to touch him. When Fernando falls during a collision with Pedro, one boy bursts into tears, convinced he will be executed for witnessing the prince's humiliation.\n\nFernando sits in the mud, watching the sobbing child, his face a mixture of confusion and disappointment.\n\n\"I am not hurt,\" he says quietly. \"I fall all the time. It is part of the game.\"\n\nBut the damage is done. The boys are sent home, and Fernando retreats to his chambers, subdued.\n\nYou find him that evening, staring out a window at the city below.\n\n\"They were afraid of me, Papa,\" he says without turning. \"Not of me—of what I am. The crown. The guards. The palace.\" He presses his palm against the cold glass. \"How do I take those things off?\"\n\n\"You cannot,\" you tell him. \"But you can show them that those things are not all you are.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"By trying again. And again. Until they believe you.\"\n\nHe tries again.\n\nThis time, Fernando asks to go to them—to play in the Plaza de Zocodover, where the common children gather. The guards protest. Álvaro raises concerns. But you permit it, with a discreet escort watching from a distance.\n\nFernando walks into the plaza in simple clothes—good wool, but nothing that screams prince. Pedro accompanies him, a familiar face to ease the transition. They bring the ball.\n\nThe city children watch from a distance, whispering. They know who he is. Everyone knows who he is.\n\nFernando does not approach them directly. Instead, he and Pedro begin to play—just the two of them, kicking the ball back and forth, laughing when they miss, chasing it across the stones. They play as if no one is watching.\n\nIt takes nearly an hour.\n\nFinally, a boy edges closer. He is perhaps six, with a dirty face and quick eyes—a baker's son, you later learn, named Tomás.\n\n\"Can I play?\" he asks, half-defiant, half-terrified.\n\nFernando smiles. \"Yes. You are on my team.\"\n\nTomás becomes the bridge.\n\nHe is not awed by princes. His father sells bread to nobles and commoners alike; he has learned that everyone needs to eat, and coins spend the same regardless of whose purse they come from. He treats Fernando like any other boy—which means he tackles him without hesitation, argues over rules, and once calls him a \"clumsy goat\" when Fernando trips over his own feet.\n\nFernando laughs.\n\nOther children see this. They see the prince fall and rise, see him accept insults with good humor, see him share the ball rather than dominate it. Slowly, cautiously, they drift closer.\n\nBy the end of the first week, there are six boys playing regularly.\n\nBy the end of the first month, there are a dozen.\n\nFernando learns their names. All of them.\n\nTomás the baker's son. Rodrigo, whose father mends shoes. Little Gaspar, the orphan who sleeps in the church doorway and plays with a ferocity born of having nothing to lose. Martín, whose mother sells fish in the market and whose hands always smell of salt and scales. Diego and Alonso, the cooper's twins, who move as one unit on the field and finish each other's sentences.\n\nHe learns more than names. He learns that Tomás's father rises before dawn to start the ovens. That Rodrigo's family cannot afford meat except on feast days. That Gaspar has no family at all, and that the other boys share their bread with him without being asked.\n\n\"Why do they do that?\" Fernando asks Pedro one evening, walking back to the Alcázar. \"Share with Gaspar? They have so little themselves.\"\n\nPedro shrugs. \"Because he is one of them. You protect your own.\"\n\nFernando is quiet for a long moment.\n\n\"I want to be one of them,\" he says finally. \"Not above them. One of them.\"\n\n\"You cannot be, Your Highness,\" Pedro says gently. \"You will be king.\"\n\n\"Then I will be a king who remembers their names.\"\n\nWord spreads through Toledo.\n\nThe merchants whisper about it in La Llotja. The craftsmen discuss it in their guilds. The servants carry tales to every noble house: The Prince of Asturias plays with common boys in the plaza. He knows their names. He lets them tackle him. He shares his food with the orphan.\n\nSome nobles are scandalized. A prince should not dirty himself with commoners. It is unseemly. It undermines the dignity of the crown.\n\nBut others—particularly those who remember the cold distance of kings past—see something different. They see a boy who might one day understand his people. A king who might listen before he commands. A ruler who knows that crowns are worn by men, and men are made of the same clay as bakers and cobblers and fishwives.\n\nDon Álvaro reports the gossip to you with a carefully neutral expression.\n\n\"They call him el príncipe llano,\" he says. \"The plain prince. Some mean it as an insult. Others...\" He pauses. \"Others say it with something like hope.\"\n\nFernando continues to play, week after week, month after month. The friendships deepen. He learns which boys can be trusted with secrets, which ones boast too freely, which ones lead and which ones follow. He learns to read faces, to sense moods, to know when Tomás is worried about his father's cough or when Gaspar has gone hungry the night before.\n\nHe brings food, sometimes—not ostentatiously, but quietly. Extra bread from the palace kitchens. Apples from the royal orchards. He never announces it, never makes it charity. He simply shares, as the boys share with each other.\n\nOne afternoon, after a particularly muddy game, Tomás walks beside Fernando toward the plaza's edge where the guards wait.\n\n\"You are strange, you know,\" Tomás says. \"For a prince.\"\n\n\"Strange how?\"\n\n\"You actually like us. Most nobles, they look at us like we are dogs. Useful, maybe, but not... people.\" Tomás kicks a pebble, watching it skitter across the stones. \"But you look at us like we matter.\"\n\nFernando considers this.\n\n\"You do matter,\" he says simply. \"My father says a king is nothing without his people. What use is a crown if no one follows you? What use is a castle if no one defends it?\"\n\nHe stops, turning to face Tomás.\n\n\"Someday I will be king. And when I am, I will need men I can trust. Men who know me—really know me. Not the crown. Me.\" He offers his hand. \"Will you be one of those men, Tomás?\"\n\nTomás stares at the offered hand. A prince's hand, extended to a baker's son in a muddy plaza.\n\nHe takes it.\n\n\"Yes,\" he says. \"I will.\"",

The current timeline is January 1438, so the expedition has not yet returned.\n\nLet me search for more context about the timeline and African ventures.\n\nThe expected results when they do return in 1439:\n- Expedition reaches Timbuktu and meets Mansa Mahmud II\n- Treaty of Timbuktu signed: trading privileges, Christian quarter permitted\n- Malian ambassador Musa Keita returns with expedition\n- 600 pounds of gold ingots, detailed maps, formal agreements\n- 13 of 32 expedition members died\n\nSo the expedition is still underway and won't return until 1439.\n\nThe Timbuktu expedition has not yet returned.\n\nYou recall the correspondence with Prince Henry in 1436—forty thousand florins approved over three years, fifteen thousand for the Senegal outpost at São Tomé da Ribeira, the remainder for the inland expedition to Mali. The men departed that same year, a small party of thirty-two souls venturing into lands no Christian had seen since ancient times.\n\nThe results are not expected until 1439—the journey is immense, the distances almost incomprehensible. The expedition must travel down the African coast by ship, establish contact with local traders, arrange guides and provisions, then venture overland across the Sahara to reach Timbuktu itself. Even if successful, the return journey will take months more.\n\nWhat has arrived, however, are periodic reports from the coastal outposts.\n\nDon Álvaro finds you the morning after the ball game, a leather dispatch case under his arm.\n\n\"News from the African ventures, Your Majesty,\" he says, settling into a chair across from you in the solar. \"Prince Henry's latest correspondence, arrived by way of Lisbon.\"\n\nHe extracts a letter bearing the Portuguese seal.\n\n\"The Senegal outpost—São João da Ribeira—is operational. They have established trade with local chieftains. Gold dust, ivory, and slaves flow through the post, though in modest quantities thus far.\" He pauses. \"Henry writes that the inland expedition passed through the outpost eight months ago, heading east toward the Niger. They were in good health and spirits. That is the last confirmed sighting.\"\n\nHe sets the letter down.\n\n\"We will know nothing more until they return—or until word comes that they will not.\"\n\nHe meets your eyes.\n\n\"It is a long time to wait, Your Majesty. But the roll of the dice was favorable. If God wills it, they will return with wonders.\"",
