      "text": "1. This is a historical RPG set in 1430s Castile\n2. The user plays Juan II of Castile\n3. They're running a crusade against Granada\n4. The Infantes de Aragón (the rebellious princes) have been dealt with in some way - desinherited\n5. Álvaro de Luna is Juan's close advisor and constable\n\nThe user is asking about the heir to the Aragonese crown now that the Infantes have been desinherited. This is a historical question I need to be careful about. Let me search the project knowledge first to understand the context better.\n\nThe user explicitly states:\n- They have enough money for now but are operating on a deficit\n- They plan to make big changes to the budget for 1432\n- They ask Álvaro who is the heir to the Aragonese crown now that the Infantes have been desinherited\n\nI need to:\n1. NOT write Juan's dialogue or actions (the player already stated what Juan asks)\n2. Provide Álvaro's response about the Aragonese succession\n3. Keep this relatively short since it's an active conversation\n4. Be historically accurate about the Aragonese succession in 1430s\n\nLet me search the project knowledge for context about the Infantes and Aragonese succession.\n\n1. Alfonso V of Aragon is 34 years old, married to Juan's sister María, but has no children after years of marriage\n2. The Infantes de Aragón (his brothers) have renounced all claims to Aragon's throne for themselves AND their descendants forever in Chapter 8.5\n3. Infante Juan has a son Carlos (age 9) who was the heir apparent but is now removed from succession due to his father's renunciation\n4. Alfonso has withdrawn active support for the crusade and relations are \"stable but cool\"\n5. Alfonso is focused on Italian campaigns in Naples\n\nSo the question Juan is asking Álvaro is: who IS the heir now?\n\nThis is a complex situation. With Alfonso having no children and his brothers having renounced for themselves and their descendants, the succession would typically fall to:\n- Other relatives in the Aragonese royal family\n- Possibly distant cousins\n- This could create a succession crisis\n\nLet me provide Álvaro's response. He would be knowledgeable about this since he analyzed it back in Chapter 8. I need to be historically accurate here.\n\nIn reality, Alfonso V did eventually have heirs through other lines, but in this alternate timeline where the Infantes have specifically renounced, the succession would be uncertain. Álvaro would know about the Trastámara family tree and potential claimants.\n\nI should keep this relatively short since it's an active conversation, maybe 3-4 paragraphs with Álvaro's response.\n\nÁlvaro sets down the ledger he's been reviewing and looks up, his expression thoughtful. \"That, Your Majesty, is the question creating sleepless nights in Barcelona and Naples,\" he says. \"And it's precisely why Alfonso withdrew his support for our crusade—he needs to focus entirely on securing his own succession.\"\n\nHe stands and moves to the window, hands clasped behind his back. \"With the Infantes' renunciation extending to all their descendants, young Carlos is eliminated. Alfonso has no legitimate children despite years of marriage to Doña María. The succession falls to... more distant relations.\" He turns back to face you. \"There are cousins—descendants of Ferdinand I through various cadet branches of the Trastámara line. But none with particularly strong claims, and several are children themselves or have their own complications.\"\n\n\"The most likely candidates would be relatives through the Urgell branch or other Trastámara cousins, but Your Majesty...\" Álvaro's eyes gleam with the careful calculation you've come to recognize. \"This is why Alfonso watches everything involving the Infantes so carefully. If he fails to produce an heir or designate a successor, Aragon faces a succession crisis that could tear the crown apart. Multiple weak claimants means potential civil war.\"\n\nHe returns to the table, tapping the ledger. \"Which brings us back to why maintaining good relations with Alfonso—and with your sister María—remains crucial. The situation is... fluid. And unlikely to resolve quickly.\"\n\nWhat do you say?",

Henry III was... let me think about this more carefully.\n\nI need to search for accurate genealogical information to give a proper answer about who the claimants would be.\n\nWeb Search: Alfonso V Aragon succession heirs 1430s Ferdinand Antequera descendants\n\nKing Alfonso V Of Aragon : Family tree by comrade28 - Geneanet geneanet.org\n\nAlfonso V of Aragon - Wikipedia wikipedia.org\n\nKing Ferdinand II Of Aragon : Family tree by comrade28 - Geneanet geneanet.org\n\nFerdinand I of Aragon - Wikipedia wikipedia.org\n\nKing Ferdinand I Of Aragon : Family tree by comrade28 - Geneanet geneanet.org\n\nKing Ferdinand II of Aragon – European Royal History wordpress.com\n\nFerdinand I | Navarrese Succession, Mediterranean Expansion & Reconquista | Britannica britannica.com\n\nKing Ferdinand I of Aragon – European Royal History wordpress.com\n\nLearn Infantes of Aragon facts for kids kiddle.co\n\nAlfonso V of Aragon | Historica Wiki | Fandom fandom.com\n\n1. Ferdinand I of Aragon (Ferdinand of Antequera) - a Trastámara from Castile, ruled Aragon 1412-1416\n2. His children:\n   - Alfonso V (current king, 1416-1458)\n   - María (married Juan II of Castile - our player)\n   - Juan (Infante, now renounced)\n   - Enrique (Infante, now renounced)\n   - Eleanor (married Edward I of Portugal)\n   - Pedro (died 1438)\n\nThe key point is that when Martin I of Aragon died without heirs in 1412, there was the \"Compromise of Caspe\" where Ferdinand was chosen. The OTHER candidate was **Count James II of Urgell**, who revolted and whose county was dissolved by Ferdinand.\n\nSo the question is: who would be the claimants now that Alfonso has no heir, the Infantes have renounced, and Carlos (Infante Juan's son) is also excluded?\n\nPotential claimants:\n1. **Juan II of Castile himself** - he's a Trastámara, nephew of Ferdinand I of Aragon, and married to Alfonso's sister María\n2. **Descendants of the Urgell line** - they were the rival claimants in 1412, though their county was dissolved\n3. **Other distant Trastámara relatives**\n4. **Descendants of earlier Aragonese kings through female lines**\n\nNow I need to search for more specific information about the Urgell claimants and Juan II's actual genealogical claim.\n\nWeb Search: Juan II Castile genealogy Trastamara Ferdinand Aragon nephew relationship\n\nJuan de Castilla y León, II (1405 - 1454) - Genealogy geni.com\n\nJohn II of Castile - Wikipedia wikipedia.org\n\nSpanish Royal Burials: House of Trastámara – Family of Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile | Unofficial Royalty unofficialroyalty.com\n\nFerdinand II of Aragon - Wikipedia wikipedia.org\n\nJuan (Castilla) Trastámara (1405-1454) | WikiTree FREE Family Tree wikitree.com\n\nJoanna of Castile - Wikipedia wikipedia.org\n\nFerdinand I of Aragon - Wikipedia wikipedia.org\n\nJuan II Trastamara : Family tree by Joan DOUGHTY (cousinjeanne) - Geneanet geneanet.org\n\nJohn II of Aragon - Wikipedia wikipedia.org\n\nJohn II of Castile - tordesillas.net tordesillas.net\n\nOkay, now I have a clearer picture. Let me piece together the genealogy:\n\n**Juan II of Castile's relationship to Ferdinand I of Aragon:**\n- Juan II's father: Henry III of Castile (died 1406)\n- Henry III's father: John I of Castile (House of Trastámara)\n- John I's father: Henry II of Trastámara (founder of the Trastámara dynasty in Castile)\n\n- Ferdinand I of Aragon's father: John I of Castile\n- So Ferdinand I and Henry III were brothers!\n\nThis makes Ferdinand I of Aragon Juan II's UNCLE (his father's brother).\n\nAlfonso V of Aragon is therefore Juan II's first cousin.\n\nThe Infantes Juan and Enrique are also Juan II's first cousins.\n\nMaría of Aragon (Alfonso's sister, Juan II's first wife who died in 1445) was Juan II's first cousin whom he married.\n\nSo Juan II of Castile is a member of the Trastámara dynasty with a legitimate claim to Aragon as well - he's Alfonso V's first cousin!\n\nNow, let me think about the succession:\n\n1. Alfonso V (no legitimate heirs)\n2. Infante Juan (renounced for himself and descendants)\n3. Infante Enrique (renounced for himself and descendants)\n4. Carlos, Prince of Viana (eliminated due to father's renunciation of descendants)\n5. Other children of Ferdinand I: Eleanor (married King of Portugal), Pedro (died 1438), María (died 1445, was Juan II's first wife), Henry (died 1445)\n\nSo the next in line after the Infantes would be... other descendants of the Trastámara line.\n\nThe key question is: who has claims?\n\n1. **Juan II of Castile** - first cousin of Alfonso V, also a Trastámara\n2. **Descendants of the Urgell branch** - they were the rival claimants in 1412 when Ferdinand was chosen\n\n3. **Other more distant Trastámara relatives** might also have potential claims through complex familial connections within the royal lineage, potentially extending the pool of possible successors beyond the immediate line.\n\nWeb Search: James II Count Urgell 1412 Compromise Caspe descendants succession claim Aragon\n\nCompromise of Caspe - Wikipedia wikipedia.org\n\nJames II, Count of Urgell - Wikipedia wikipedia.org\n\nHistory - La Real Casa d'Aragona real-aragon.org\n\nCompromise of Caspe en-academic.com\n\nCount of Urgell's revolt - Wikipedia wikipedia.org\n\nLearn James II, Count of Urgell facts for kids kiddle.co\n\nJaume II 'el Dissortat' d'Aragó i Montferrat, comte d'Urgell (1380 - 1433) - Genealogy geni.com\n\nLearn Compromise of Caspe facts for kids kiddle.co\n\nTHE COMPROMISE OF CASPE - ARAGON - THE DEVELOPMENT OF EUROPEAN STATES - c. 1415-c. 1500 - The new cambridge medieval history erenow.org\n\nMonument to Count James II of Urgell - ART CLIPPINGS - PUBLICATIONS - Museu de la noguera museucn.com\n\n**James II, Count of Urgell:**\n- Born 1380, died 1433 in captivity\n- Was the closest male-line descendant of the House of Barcelona\n- Great-grandson of Alfonso IV of Aragon\n- Lost the Compromise of Caspe in 1412 to Ferdinand of Antequera\n- Rebelled in 1413, was defeated, imprisoned for life\n- Died WITHOUT HEIR in 1433\n\n**Alfonso, Duke of Gandia:**\n- Also a claimant in 1412\n- Died in 1454 without heir\n\nSo BOTH rival claimants from 1412 are now dead (by 1430 in our game) or will die without heirs. \n\nThis means the succession situation in Aragon is:\n\n**Current Line (House of Trastámara through Ferdinand I):**\n1. Alfonso V (no legitimate children)\n2. Infante Juan (renounced for himself and descendants) → Carlos excluded\n3. Infante Enrique (renounced for himself and descendants)\n4. María (died 1445, had no surviving children with Juan II)\n5. Eleanor (married King Edward of Portugal, died 1445)\n6. Pedro (died 1438)\n\n**Alternative Claimants:**\n1. **Juan II of Castile** - First cousin of Alfonso V, also a Trastámara (son of Henry III of Castile, whose father John I of Castile was Ferdinand I's father too - they were brothers!)\n2. **Urgell line** - EXTINCT (James II died 1433 without heir)\n3. **Gandia line** - will die out in 1454 without heir\n4. **Other Trastámara branches** - various more distant relatives\n\nSo Juan II has a VERY legitimate claim as Alfonso's first cousin! In fact, he might be one of the strongest claimants after the Infantes renounced.\n\nI'll craft a diplomatic explanation that subtly highlights Juan II's strongest claim while maintaining political nuance. I'll emphasize the family connections and legal legitimacy without appearing too aggressive.\n\nÁlvaro's expression shifts from thoughtful to deeply engaged. He returns to the table and spreads his hands flat on its surface, as if laying out chess pieces.\n\n\"Your Majesty has identified the key question precisely.\" He pauses, organizing his thoughts. \"Let me map this properly, because the situation is more complex—and more favorable to Your Majesty—than it first appears.\"\n\n\"The candidates, in rough order of claim strength:\n\nFirst: Your Majesty yourself. You are Alfonso's first cousin—your father Henry III and Alfonso's father Ferdinand were brothers, both sons of John I of Castile. You share Trastámara blood equally with Alfonso. In fact,\" he meets your eyes significantly, \"you might argue your claim is stronger than Ferdinand's was in 1412, since you descend through the legitimate male line just as Alfonso does.\n\nSecond: Any surviving children of Alfonso's siblings. Eleanor married the King of Portugal and had children before her death—those Portuguese grandchildren have claims. Pedro died in 1438 without surviving issue. María, your first wife, had only young Enrique who survived infancy with you. Henry, Duke of Villena, also has descendants.\n\nThird: The Urgell line—but here's the crucial point: Count James II of Urgell died in prison in 1433 without heirs. His line is extinct. The other 1412 claimant, Alfonso Duke of Gandia, is ancient and childless. When he dies, that claim vanishes too.\n\nFourth: Various distant Trastámara cousins through cadet branches. Weaker claims, children, complications.\"\n\nÁlvaro straightens. \"But there's another critical factor, Your Majesty. The Compromise of Caspe in 1412 wasn't about bloodlines alone—it was political. They chose Ferdinand over the 'rightful' Urgell heir because Ferdinand had an army, papal support, and could actually rule. The lesson? Aragon's succession crises get resolved by capability as much as genealogy.\"\n\n\"Which brings us to the factions that matter:\n\nThe Castilian Faction: Nobles who supported Ferdinand in 1412 and now benefit from Trastámara rule. They might support Your Majesty as continuity—another Trastámara who keeps their positions secure. But they'd need assurance their privileges continue.\n\nThe Catalonian Faction: Deeply resented the Caspe decision. They wanted Urgell because he was Catalan, House of Barcelona. With Urgell extinct, they're adrift. They might resist another Castilian... or embrace you if you court them properly.\n\nThe Aragonese Faction: Pragmatists. They care about strong rule, Mediterranean trade, Italian ambitions. They'll back whoever can deliver stability and prosperity.\n\nThe Portuguese Faction: Through Eleanor's marriage, Portugal has claims through her children. They'll make noise but probably lack the force to push it seriously.\n\nThe Italian Faction: Alfonso's bastard son Ferdinand has support in Naples. If Alfonso legitimizes him and designates him heir, that's a powerful claim—especially with Alfonso's Neapolitan focus.\"\n\nÁlvaro leans forward. \"Your Majesty's strategic position: You're the closest legitimate male Trastámara after the Infantes renounced. You're married to Alfonso's sister's memory and now to a Portuguese princess—dynastically impressive. You're conducting a papal crusade—religious legitimacy. And if Granada falls...\" he smiles slightly, \"you'll be a conquering hero with military credibility the Aragonese nobility respects.\n\nBut,\" his tone becomes cautionary, \"Alfonso is only thirty-four. He could live another twenty-five years. He could legitimize his bastard. He could father legitimate children still. The situation is fluid, and much depends on time, politics, and relationships.\"\n\nHe sits back. \"The question isn't just who has claims, Your Majesty. It's who will be in position to press those claims when the time comes, and who the Aragonese nobility will actually accept.\"",

In fact, the situation grows more alarming by the month.\"\n\nHe crosses to a map on the wall. \"Bohemia remains firmly in Hussite hands—heretics who reject papal authority, administer communion in both kinds, and have defeated five crusades sent against them. Five, Your Majesty.\" He holds up his hand for emphasis. \"The most recent was just this past August at Domažlice. The crusaders—led by Frederick of Brandenburg and Cardinal Cesarini himself as papal legate—were utterly routed. The reports say they fled in panic merely upon hearing the Hussites singing their battle hymns.\"\n\nHe returns to face you. \"These heretics are no mere peasant rabble. Under commanders like Jan Žižka—now deceased—and currently Prokop the Great, they've developed devastating military tactics using war wagons and early firearms. They've not only defended Bohemia but conducted aggressive raids deep into Germany, Silesia, and Hungary. The German princes are terrified the heresy will spread to their lands.\"\n\n\"The situation is complicated because the Hussites are divided among themselves. The moderate faction—called Utraquists—simply want communion in both kinds and some church reforms. The radical faction—the Taborites—want wholesale revolution, attacking church wealth and hierarchy itself. But when crusaders threaten, they unite and crush them.\"\n\nHe pauses. \"There is... one development. The Council of Basel, which convened this past March, has extended an invitation to the Hussites to negotiate. On October 15th—just weeks ago—they formally invited Hussite representatives to attend the council and discuss terms. The Church is finally admitting that military solutions have failed.\"\n\nÁlvaro's tone becomes more pointed. \"This is significant for Your Majesty's crusade. Every crusade against the Hussites has failed spectacularly, draining resources and manpower that might otherwise go to Granada. And it demonstrates that even the most stubborn heresy, when backed by military success, forces the Church to negotiate rather than simply condemn.\"\n\nHe meets your eyes. \"The Hussites remain defiantly heretical, Your Majesty. Bohemia is lost to Rome for now, though negotiations may bring some reconciliation. But they've proven that a determined, militarily competent force can resist even papal crusades for over a decade.\"",

The Council was called by Pope Martin V shortly before his death in February 1431\n2. It officially opened on July 23, 1431\n3. Cardinal Giuliano Cesarini was the papal legate presiding - the same cardinal who led the failed crusade against the Hussites\n4. In December 1431, Pope Eugene IV (the new pope) tried to dissolve the council, but the council refused\n5. This created a major conflict about whether the Pope or Church Councils have supreme authority\n6. The council invoked the decrees of Constance declaring councils superior to popes in certain matters\n7. Major issues being discussed:\n   - The Hussite heresy (invitation sent October 15, 1431)\n   - Church reform (especially limiting papal power and revenues)\n   - Reunion with the Greek/Eastern Church\n   - Papal supremacy vs conciliar supremacy\n\nEffects on Castile's crusade:\n- This is a major power struggle that could affect all church matters\n- If the council wins, it could mean more decentralized church authority\n- The Hussite negotiations show the church is willing to compromise with heretics when military force fails\n- The conflict between pope and council could distract from other crusades\n- Cardinal Cesarini, who just failed against the Hussites, is now leading the council negotiations\n\nThis is December 1431 in the game, so the council is just getting started and the pope has just tried to dissolve it.\n\nÁlvaro's expression becomes grave. He pulls over a chair and sits, clearly preparing for a lengthy explanation.\n\n\"Your Majesty, the Council of Basel may be the most significant ecclesiastical event of our generation—and it's unfolding right now.\" He leans forward. \"The implications for your crusade, for papal authority, for the entire structure of the Church... they're profound.\"\n\n\"The basics first: Pope Martin V—God rest his soul—called this council shortly before his death this past February. It officially opened on July 23rd in Basel, in Switzerland. The papal legate presiding is Cardinal Giuliano Cesarini.\" He pauses meaningfully. \"Yes, the same Cardinal Cesarini who just led the disastrous fifth crusade against the Hussites at Domažlice in August. When the crusaders fled in panic, he barely escaped with his life.\"\n\n\"When Cesarini arrived at Basel in September, attendance was sparse. The new Pope, Eugenius IV—a Venetian who succeeded Martin—looked at the meager turnout and in December issued a bull dissolving the council. He ordered everyone to reconvene at Bologna in eighteen months instead.\"\n\nÁlvaro's eyes gleam. \"But here's where it becomes explosive: the council refused to disperse. They invoked the decrees of the Council of Constance—the council that ended the Great Schism twenty years ago—which declared that in matters of faith, schism, and reform, a general council draws its authority directly from God and even the Pope must obey.\"\n\nHe stands and begins pacing. \"This is the fundamental question now tearing the Church apart: Who governs? The Pope? Or the councils? The council fathers at Basel believe the Pope has become too powerful, too corrupt, too focused on revenues and Italian politics. They demand reform of the Church 'in head and members'—meaning the papacy itself must be reformed.\"\n\n\"The main issues being debated:\n\nFirst, the Hussites: On October 15th—just last month—the council formally invited Hussite representatives to Basel to negotiate. This is extraordinary, Your Majesty. For sixteen years, the Church has been sending crusade after crusade against these heretics, all of which failed. Now, after Cesarini's humiliation at Domažlice, the council is negotiating with them as equals. They're discussing the 'Four Articles of Prague'—the Hussite demands for communion in both kinds, freedom of preaching, limitation of church property, and punishment of mortal sins regardless of rank.\n\nSecond, church reform: The council wants to strip away papal revenues—annates, provisions, all the fees that fund Rome. They want to limit papal authority over appointments, elections, and church governance. They're essentially trying to turn the papacy from an absolute monarchy into something more... consultative.\n\nThird, reunion with the Greeks: Both the Pope and the council want the glory of reuniting with the Eastern Church. The Byzantine Empire is desperate for help against the Turks and is willing to discuss church union. But who gets to negotiate? The Pope wants it in Italy, under his control. The council wants it at Basel, under theirs.\n\nFourth, the fundamental power struggle: Is papal supremacy absolute? Or are councils superior to popes? This question threatens the very structure of Church governance.\"\n\nÁlvaro returns to face you directly. \"Now, how does this affect Your Majesty and Granada?\n\nThe papal bull authorizing your crusade comes from Pope Martin V and has been confirmed by Eugenius IV. But if the council succeeds in asserting supremacy over the Pope, could they... modify it? Revoke it? Redirect resources? The legal foundation of your entire campaign depends on papal authority remaining strong.\n\nCompeting priorities: Every moment the Church spends negotiating with Hussites or arguing about governance is time not spent supporting Granada. Cardinal Cesarini, who should be championing crusades, is now embroiled in council politics.\n\nThe Hussite precedent: If the council successfully negotiates peace with heretics who defeated five crusades, what message does that send? That military failure forces the Church to compromise? That heretics can win through arms what they cannot through theology? Some might wonder whether Granada, if it proves too difficult, might also be subject to... negotiation rather than conquest.\n\nChurch revenues: The council wants to slash papal income. But papal income funds crusade infrastructure—diplomatic networks, indulgence collections, coordination of international efforts. A weakened papacy means less support for distant crusades.\n\nFractured authority: Right now, Christendom is watching the Pope and a council locked in battle, each claiming divine authority. This creates confusion about who speaks for the Church. When you need papal support—say, for additional bulls, for settling disputes with Military Orders, for pressuring reluctant nobles—will that authority be respected if half of Europe thinks councils are supreme?\"\n\nHe sits back down. \"Your Majesty, you've built your entire strategy on papal legitimacy. You carry the Pope's banner. You wield the True Cross. Your authority to command the Military Orders comes from papal bulls. But we're entering a period where that very authority is being contested at the highest levels of the Church.\"\n\n\"The optimistic view? The council might be so focused on Hussites and reform that they leave Granada crusades alone, especially since you have strong papal backing already. The pessimistic view? The entire edifice of papal crusading authority could be weakened just as you need it most.\"\n\nHe meets your eyes. \"I recommend we watch Basel very, very carefully. And perhaps... cultivate relationships with both sides of this dispute. Because whichever wins—Pope or council—we'll need their continued support for Granada.\"\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this situation?",

This would be politically savvy given the Granada crusade connection\n\nÁlvaro would know all this and would be somewhat embarrassed that they haven't already sent representation given the importance to their crusade.\n\nÁlvaro's face colors slightly—a rare sight. He stands abruptly and moves to his documents.\n\n\"Your Majesty... you are absolutely correct. And I confess this oversight.\" He shuffles through papers. \"The council opened on July 23rd—nearly three months ago. It is meeting right now, as we speak. Cardinal Cesarini has been presiding since September.\"\n\nHe turns back to you, looking genuinely chagrined. \"With the chaos of the Council of Seville, the princess's arrival, the Infantes' situation, the Aragonese complications... we failed to consider Basel. But you're right—this directly affects us, and we should have representation there.\"\n\nHe begins calculating on his fingers. \"Basel is in Switzerland, near the borders of the Empire and France. From Seville... a fast diplomatic party with proper escort could reach there in five to six weeks if they travel hard. Less if they take ship to Barcelona and then overland through Aragon and southern France, though given the current... temperature with Alfonso, that route might be problematic.\"\n\n\"The council shows every sign of continuing for months, possibly years. The Hussite negotiations alone will take considerable time—the delegation from Bohemia hasn't even arrived yet. They were only invited on October 15th, just two weeks ago.\"\n\nÁlvaro's tactical mind engages fully. \"Your Majesty should absolutely send representation. Here's why:\n\nFirst, you are conducting a papal crusade. You carry papal authority. The council is discussing crusades, heresy, and church reform—all directly relevant to Granada. If decisions are made about crusade funding, indulgences, or priorities, you need a voice at that table.\n\nSecond, your commitment to fight heretics as well as infidels—which you discussed with Pope Martin himself—makes your presence at a council dealing with the Hussite heresy both appropriate and expected. You've proven you can succeed where others failed. That carries weight.\n\nThird, the political reality: Right now the council and Pope Eugenius are headed toward confrontation. You have strong papal support, but the council has the support of many bishops and princes. If you cultivate relationships with both sides, you protect your crusade regardless of who wins this power struggle.\n\nFourth, Cardinal Cesarini himself is there. He just led the failed crusade against Hussites. You are leading a successful papal crusade. The contrast is... notable. A well-chosen representative could build a relationship with him, perhaps offering lessons learned, demonstrating that papal crusades can work when properly conducted.\"\n\nHe paces, thinking aloud. \"Who to send? This requires delicacy. We need someone with:\n\nTheological credibility to discuss heresy and crusade theology\n\nDiplomatic skill to navigate between Pope and council factions\n\nAuthority to speak for Your Majesty\n\nUnderstanding of crusade logistics and military matters\n\nEnough status to be taken seriously by cardinals and bishops\n\nArchbishop García would be ideal but he's too valuable here, managing the crusade preparations. Bishop Sancho of Ávila perhaps? Or...\" he pauses, \"what about Fray Hernando de Talavera? He has theological depth, diplomatic experience, and—crucially—he examined the Infantes. He understands heresy firsthand. He could speak with authority about both crusading and dealing with those who stray from orthodoxy.\"\n\nÁlvaro looks at you directly. \"But this is Your Majesty's decision. Who would you wish to represent Castile and the Granada crusade at Basel? And what should their instructions be?\"\n\nHe adds quickly, \"If we dispatch them within the week, they could arrive by late November or early December—still early in the council's proceedings. We haven't missed the opportunity, Your Majesty, though we should have thought of this sooner.\"\n\nWhat are your thoughts? Who should represent you at Basel, and with what instructions?",

      "text": "This is interesting. Juan is expressing some proto-conciliarist sympathies here, or at least questioning papal supremacy. This is actually quite historically authentic - many serious Catholic rulers in this period had complex views on papal authority, especially when dealing with practical politics.\n\nJuan wants to:\n1. Keep Fray Hernando close (understandable - he's the confessor)\n2. Convene his own theological council in Toledo\n3. Discuss the implications of Basel for Castilian church relations\n4. Express his own nuanced view on papal authority - he sees popes as divinely inspired but human, not speaking directly for God\n\nÁlvaro would be both cautious and intrigued by this. On one hand, questioning papal authority could be dangerous. On the other hand, Juan is expressing a fairly moderate position that many thoughtful Catholics held. The key is that Juan still respects papal authority, he just doesn't see it as absolute or infallible.\n\nThis is a significant moment - Juan is showing real theological sophistication and political maturity. Álvaro would need to respond carefully, acknowledging the validity of Juan's concerns while also warning about the dangers of appearing to side too strongly with the conciliarist faction.\n\nThis could also affect who they send to Basel - they need someone who can navigate this nuanced position. Not a radical conciliarist, but someone who understands the concerns on both sides.\n\nLet me have Álvaro respond thoughtfully to this.\n\nÁlvaro goes very still. For a long moment, he simply looks at you, and you can see him carefully weighing his words.\n\n\"Your Majesty...\" He sits down slowly. \"What you've just said is both profoundly wise and profoundly dangerous. And I mean that with the utmost respect.\"\n\nHe leans forward, speaking quietly despite being alone. \"You are correct, of course. Popes are men. I've worked with them, negotiated with them, watched them make decisions based on Italian politics rather than divine guidance. Pope Martin—God rest his soul—was a shrewd politician as much as a holy father. Pope Eugenius is a Venetian with Venetian interests. They are divinely inspired, as you say, but they are not God's mouthpiece in the way some claim.\"\n\nHe pauses, choosing his next words carefully. \"But Your Majesty, this distinction—between divine inspiration and divine authority—is precisely what the Council of Basel is fighting about. And it's tearing the Church apart. Many at Basel would agree with you completely. Cardinal Cesarini himself might agree. But to say such things publicly, to organize a theological council in Toledo to discuss these matters...\"\n\nHe spreads his hands. \"It positions Castile in the middle of the greatest ecclesiastical crisis since the Great Schism. Which might be exactly where we need to be, but we must be careful.\"\n\nÁlvaro stands and begins pacing. \"A theological council in Toledo is an excellent idea. But we must frame it carefully. Not as 'questioning papal authority' but as 'seeking to understand how Castile can best serve the Church during this time of confusion.' Not rebellion, but faithful inquiry.\"\n\n\"Who to invite? This requires thought:\n\nArchbishop García of Toledo must preside—it's his see, his authority.\n\nThe other bishops—Sancho of Ávila, Diego of León, perhaps others from major sees. Get a range of perspectives.\n\nDoctors of theology from Salamanca and other universities. Men who understand canon law, church history, the writings of the Church Fathers.\n\nRepresentatives of the Military Orders—they answer to the Pope but operate in Castile. They need to understand where we stand.\n\nFray Hernando must attend, of course, even if not as your personal representative. His theological depth is essential.\n\nPerhaps representatives from major monasteries—Dominicans, Franciscans, Cistercians. Different orders have different perspectives on papal authority.\"\n\nHe turns back to you. \"The questions for this council to address—and Your Majesty, these must be framed carefully:\n\nOne: How should Castile respond to the dispute between Basel and Pope Eugenius? Do we support the Pope? The council? Remain neutral?\n\nTwo: What is the proper relationship between royal authority and papal authority in Castile? The Pope issued your crusade bull, but you wield the sword. Where does spiritual authority end and temporal begin?\n\nThree: If the Council of Basel makes decrees about crusades, church revenues, or ecclesiastical appointments—and Pope Eugenius rejects them—which does Castile follow?\n\nFour: How do we protect the Granada crusade's papal legitimacy while the very concept of papal legitimacy is being contested?\n\nFive: What theological principles should guide our understanding of church authority? Where do councils, popes, Scripture, and tradition stand in relation to each other?\"\n\nÁlvaro's expression becomes very serious. \"Your Majesty, I must warn you: this could be seen as extremely bold. Some might call it presumptuous for a king to convene a theological council. Others might see it as an act of faithful stewardship during uncertain times. The difference depends entirely on how we present it and what conclusions it reaches.\"\n\nHe meets your eyes. \"But here's the strategic value: if we convene this council, study these questions seriously, and arrive at carefully reasoned conclusions, then we can send a delegation to Basel representing not just Your Majesty personally, but Castile's considered theological position. That carries far more weight than a single envoy.\"\n\n\"The delegation could include several members of your Toledo council—perhaps a bishop, a doctor of theology, and a representative of the Military Orders. They could speak with authority about how these decisions affect not just Castile, but the entire crusading enterprise.\"\n\nHe pauses. \"There's also this to consider: France has already begun positioning itself. They have representatives at Basel. If Castile remains absent while France, Germany, and the Italian states are all present and arguing about the Church's future... we lose influence over decisions that directly affect us.\"\n\nÁlvaro returns to his seat. \"When should this Toledo council convene? How long should it deliberate? And what should its public purpose be—remembering that everyone in Europe will be watching what Castile does in response to Basel?\"\n\nHe adds quietly, \"And Your Majesty... regarding what you said about divine inspiration versus divine authority. You're not alone in thinking this. Many faithful, intelligent Catholics share your view. But be very careful who you say it to. Even thoughtful questioning of papal claims can be twisted into accusations of heresy by enemies. The Hussites began with similar questions, and now they've been fighting crusades for sixteen years.\"\n\nWhat are your instructions for this theological council?",

In fact, it's exactly what a prudent, pious king should do.\" He nods approvingly. \"You're not rushing to pick sides in a church dispute. You're not making unilateral declarations. You're consulting with your own clergy, developing a considered theological position, and then engaging with Basel from a place of wisdom rather than impulse. It's the very model of responsible Christian kingship.\"\n\nHe begins making notes. \"This also sends exactly the right message to everyone watching: Castile takes matters of faith seriously. The king leading a papal crusade naturally wants to understand how ecclesiastical disputes might affect his sacred mission.

      "text": "These are interesting mix - one very positive (12), two neutral/mixed (40, 35), and one negative (78). I need to weave these into a narrative where Álvaro presents them to Juan in order, probably going from positive to increasingly concerning.\n\nI should keep the response relatively focused - present each issue, let Juan absorb the information, and allow for his response. This is still an informational briefing, not a major decision point yet, though the clergy exaggerating indulgences and the officer considering leaving for Aragon could require some thought.\n\nÁlvaro arranges four documents on the table, organizing them thoughtfully.\n\n\"Your Majesty, let me present these in order—starting with encouraging news and moving to matters that require more... consideration.\" He picks up the first document, and his expression is genuinely pleased.\n\n\"First, something remarkable:\" He unfolds a piece of parchment with musical notation and verse written on it. \"A popular ballad about the crusade has begun spreading through the taverns and markets of Castile. It's called 'The Young King's Sword' or sometimes 'The Banner of the True Cross.' Listen to the refrain:\n\n'Juan the Just with heaven's might,\nBears the Cross into the fight,\nGranada's moon shall fade to black,\nWhen Spain's true king comes marching back.'\n\nIt's quite rousing, actually—catchy melody, memorable words. Reports from Burgos, Valladolid, Toledo, even Barcelona say people are singing it. More importantly...\" he taps another report, \"our recruitment officers say the ballad is having a tangible effect. Young men are arriving in Seville humming it, saying they heard it in their villages and felt called to join the crusade. One officer estimated it's worth an additional twenty to thirty volunteers in the past two weeks alone.\"\n\nHe smiles slightly. \"The people are turning your crusade into legend before it's even begun, Your Majesty. That's powerful. Though I'll note the lyrics do set rather... high expectations for success.\"\n\nHe sets that aside and picks up the second document, his expression becoming more serious.\n\n\"Second, intelligence from the Granada frontier:\" \"Our agents report something interesting—and potentially significant—from within Granada. Sultan Muhammad IX has apparently executed at least three commanders in the past month. The charges were 'cowardice and failure' after losing skirmishes on the frontier.\"\n\nÁlvaro looks up. \"Now, this could mean several things. On one hand, it suggests the Sultan is taking the threat of our crusade very seriously—he's not tolerating any weakness. On the other hand, executing your own commanders is often a sign of desperation or poor judgment. It creates fear rather than loyalty. Several Granadan officers have reportedly requested transfers away from frontier commands, and morale among their garrison troops is said to be declining.\"\n\nHe taps the document. \"The question is whether this represents Granada steeling itself for determined resistance, or whether it indicates the Sultan is already rattled—perhaps fearful that Allah has withdrawn favor after the Council of Seville's spiritual display. Our intelligence suggests it may be the latter. The executions seem... excessive. Panic disguised as strength.\"\n\n\"We should watch this carefully. A desperate Sultan makes different decisions than a confident one.\"\n\nHe picks up the third document, and his expression becomes disapproving.\n\n\"Third, a matter requiring Your Majesty's attention:\" \"We have reports from multiple cities—Burgos, León, Salamanca—that certain clergy members preaching the crusade are making... shall we say, exaggerated promises about indulgences.\"\n\nHe reads from the report: \"'Any man who takes the cross will have ALL sins forgiven, including future sins, and is guaranteed entry to Paradise regardless of his deeds.' Another preacher in Ávila reportedly said: 'A crusader can commit no sin while fighting the Moors, for any act in service of Christ is sanctified.' And one particularly enthusiastic friar in Burgos claimed: 'One day fighting in Granada earns more merit than a lifetime of prayer.'\"\n\nÁlvaro sets down the document with clear distaste. \"Your Majesty, these are not the terms of Pope Martin's bull. The indulgences granted are substantial, yes—remission of temporal punishment for confessed sins. But these preachers are promising things the Church cannot deliver. This is theologically problematic and, frankly, borders on the kind of indulgence abuse that Jan Hus condemned—the very heresy we're supposed to oppose.\"\n\nHe meets your eyes. \"The practical effect is double-edged. On one hand, it's attracting recruits—men who believe they've purchased salvation with their swords. On the other hand, it sets false expectations. What happens when these men commit sins in camp and realize they're not actually immune to guilt? What happens if they survive the crusade and confess to priests who tell them the promises were false?\"\n\n\"Moreover, if this reaches Basel—and it will—it gives ammunition to those who say papal crusading authority is corrupt and abused. Cardinal Cesarini himself might use this as evidence that crusade preaching needs reform.\"\n\nHe spreads his hands. \"We should probably issue some guidance to the clergy about accurate presentation of indulgence terms. But I leave that to Your Majesty's judgment. Do we risk dampening enthusiasm by correcting the exaggerations, or do we risk worse problems by letting them continue?\"\n\nFinally, he picks up the fourth document, and his expression is genuinely troubled.\n\n\"Fourth, a concerning development:\" \"Your Majesty, do you remember Don Rodrigo de Perea? The young commander who distinguished himself at the tournament last month—excellent tactical mind, trained in military engineering, one of our more promising officer recruits?\"\n\nHe pauses. \"We've received word that King Alfonso of Aragon has extended him an offer. A significant offer—command of a company in the Neapolitan campaigns, generous pay, a grant of land in Sicily upon successful conclusion of the Italian wars. And...\" Álvaro's jaw tightens, \"the offer was apparently delivered by one of the Aragonese courtiers who attended your Council of Seville. They've been watching our preparations closely.\"\n\n\"Don Rodrigo hasn't accepted yet—he sent word to Álvaro asking for counsel. But Your Majesty, this is troubling on multiple levels. First, we're losing talented officers we can ill afford to lose. Second, it suggests Alfonso is not merely withdrawing support for our crusade but actively competing with us for military talent. Third, if this becomes a pattern—if Aragon begins offering better terms to our crusaders—it could undermine our entire recruitment effort.\"\n\nHe sets down the document. \"The immediate question is what to do about Don Rodrigo specifically. Do we match the offer? Do we appeal to his honor and faith? Do we let him go and accept that some men will choose Italian adventure over holy war? And the larger question: how do we counter Aragon's interference without escalating tensions with Alfonso?\"\n\nÁlvaro sits back, having presented all four matters. \"Your Majesty, these are the reports requiring attention. The ballad is simply good news to celebrate. The Granadan executions we should monitor. But the indulgence preaching and the Aragonese recruitment both require decisions.\"\n\nHe looks at you expectantly. \"Which would you like to address first? Or do you have thoughts on all of them?\"",

We are all committed to first complete the Grenada crusade, recieve our worldly reward and thenm seek other goals. So it really depends if this young officer is allowed to leave both because of his crusader vows and according to his feudal contract. The crown will not intervene, in fact if he chooses to leave, we send him on his way with our blessing. Men are free to choose what they will.",

      "text": "1. Regarding the indulgence preaching issue: Juan wants to issue immediate guidance to clergy that this exaggerated preaching is wrong and not what the crusade is about. He wants to communicate to the army/crusaders that the crusade is NOT about pillaging or believing you're immune to sin. This is very much in character - Juan has consistently shown genuine religious conviction and concern about doing things properly.\n\n2. Regarding Don Rodrigo: Juan's position is principled and clear:\n- If someone has NOT sworn crusade vows, they're free to leave with blessing\n- If someone HAS sworn crusade vows before the True Cross, they are bound to complete the Granada crusade first\n- The question is whether Don Rodrigo has taken crusader vows or is just a recruited officer\n- Juan won't intervene either way - respects free will and contractual obligations\n\nÁlvaro should respond to both decisions. For the first, he should probably be relieved and supportive - this is the right call and prevents future problems. For the second, he needs to clarify Don Rodrigo's status and probably appreciate Juan's principled stance while maybe noting the practical implications.\n\nThis is still the same meeting in October 1431, so we're wrapping up this discussion session.\n\nÁlvaro's expression shifts immediately to one of profound relief and approval.\n\n\"Your Majesty, that is exactly the right decision on the preaching.\" He stands, energized. \"This is precisely the kind of judgment that will distinguish your crusade from the disasters we've seen elsewhere. You're thinking not just about recruitment numbers, but about the soul of this enterprise.\"\n\nHe begins making notes rapidly. \"I'll draft the guidance immediately. We'll send it under the authority of Archbishop García—more appropriate coming from ecclesiastical authority—but making clear it reflects your will as Supreme Commander. The key points:\n\nTo the clergy: The indulgences granted by the papal bull are substantial and genuine, but they require genuine contrition, confession, and amendment of life. They do not create immunity from sin or guarantee salvation regardless of conduct. Any preacher who claims otherwise is misrepresenting Church teaching and undermining the crusade's spiritual legitimacy.\n\nTo the army: Every crusader remains accountable to God and to military discipline. The crusade is a holy war, yes, but holiness requires righteousness in conduct. Pillaging, rape, unnecessary cruelty—these are sins whether committed against Christians or Moors. We fight to bring Christian rule to Granada, not to indulge our basest impulses.\"\n\nHe looks up. \"This will disappoint some who joined expecting license to behave badly. We may lose a few recruits. But Your Majesty, those are precisely the men we don't want. Better to have fewer crusaders of good character than more who think they carry a divine permission slip for sin.\"\n\nHe sets down his pen. \"And frankly, this protects us at Basel. If Cardinal Cesarini or others criticize crusade preaching, we can point to your directive as evidence that Castile takes these concerns seriously. It's good theology, good policy, and good politics all at once.\"\n\nRegarding Don Rodrigo, Álvaro flips through some documents.\n\n\"Let me check his status...\" He scans a roster. \"Ah. Don Rodrigo attended the Council of Seville and expressed interest in joining the crusade. He participated in training exercises and accepted a provisional officer's commission. But...\" Álvaro looks up, \"he has not yet appeared before Fray Hernando for examination, and he has not taken formal crusader vows before the True Cross.\"\n\nHe sets down the document. \"So by your principle, Your Majesty, he is free to leave. He made no sacred oath. His feudal obligations to his lord—the Count of Osuna—are a matter between them, not the Crown's concern.\"\n\nÁlvaro pauses, considering. \"Your Majesty's position is remarkably principled. 'Men are free to choose what they will.' In an age where kings press men into service and bind them with increasingly complex obligations, you're... respecting their agency. It's unusual. And possibly expensive in the short term.\"\n\nHe begins pacing slowly. \"The practical implications: If word spreads that officers can leave for better opportunities, we may lose more talented men to Aragon, Burgundy, or Italian campaigns. On the other hand, those who stay will be here because they genuinely want to be—they believe in the crusade, not just the pay. That creates a different kind of army.\"\n\nHe turns back to you. \"And the signal it sends to Alfonso is interesting. You're not competing with him for men's loyalty. You're not getting into a bidding war. You're simply... offering a holy cause, and trusting men to choose correctly. It's either profoundly confident or...\" he smiles slightly, \"perhaps it's both wisdom and faith combined.\"\n\n\"Should I send word to Don Rodrigo? Something to the effect of: 'His Majesty thanks you for your service in training and preparations. As you have not taken sacred crusader vows, you remain free in conscience and law to pursue whatever opportunities you deem best. If you choose Aragon's offer, you go with the Crown's blessing. If you choose to stay and take crusader vows, you will be welcome and honored. The choice is yours alone.'\"\n\nÁlvaro raises an eyebrow. \"That should thoroughly confuse the Aragonese agents who expected us to panic and make counter-offers.\"\n\nHe returns to his seat. \"Are there any other instructions regarding these matters, Your Majesty? Or shall I begin drafting the guidance on indulgence preaching immediately?\"",

      "text": "Álvaro needs to:\n1. Take this very seriously - this is his king expressing doubts that could be considered heretical if misunderstood\n2. Be supportive but also cautionary - this is dangerous thinking\n3. Perhaps share that he's had similar thoughts but emphasize the need for absolute discretion\n4. Maybe frame it in a way that's less dangerous - distinguishing between the universal Church (Christianity) and the institutional Church (Vatican)\n5. Connect it to why the Toledo council is actually a good idea\n6. Emphasize the EXTREME danger of these thoughts becoming public\n\nJuan is basically having an early proto-Protestant realization about the distinction between faith and institution. This is historically very significant and needs to be handled carefully.\n\nÁlvaro would be both impressed by Juan's theological sophistication and terrified of the implications if this became known.\n\nÁlvaro freezes in the act of gathering his papers. For a long moment, he doesn't move. Then, very deliberately, he sets everything down, walks to the door, and checks that it's firmly closed. He returns and sits, his expression more serious than you've ever seen it.\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" he says quietly, \"what you just said... I need you to understand how dangerous those words are.\"\n\nHe leans forward, speaking barely above a whisper despite the empty room. \"I'm going to say something I've never said to anyone, not even my confessor. I've had the same thought. The exact same thought. And it terrified me.\"\n\nHe glances at the door again, then continues. \"I've worked with popes, Your Majesty. I've negotiated with cardinals, managed papal diplomacy, watched the machinery of the Vatican operate up close. And I've seen... men. Ambitious men, political men, sometimes holy men, but always men. Men who make mistakes, who have favorites, who sometimes confuse their political interests with God's will.\"\n\nHe spreads his hands. \"And yet we're taught that this institution is the Church, that to question Rome is to question Christianity itself, that the Pope speaks with divine authority. But if that were absolutely true...\" he pauses, choosing words carefully, \"then how do we explain the Great Schism? Three popes simultaneously, each claiming divine authority, each excommunicating the others. Which one was truly speaking for God? All of them? None of them?\"\n\nÁlvaro stands and paces to the window, keeping his voice low. \"What you're realizing, Your Majesty, is the difference between the faith—Christianity, the teachings of Christ, the salvation of souls—and the institution that administers it. They're not identical. They should be aligned, and often are, but they're not the same thing.\"\n\nHe turns back. \"The Vatican is a human institution, created to serve Christianity. But like all human institutions, it has... drift. Politics. Self-interest. The question is whether that drift has become so severe that the institution sometimes works against the faith it's supposed to serve.\"\n\nHis expression becomes very grave. \"But Your Majesty, here's why I checked the door and why we must never speak of this outside this room: Jan Hus had similar thoughts. He looked at the corruption in the Church, the sale of indulgences, the political machinations, and said 'This institution has strayed from true Christianity.' And they burned him for it. Sixteen years of war have followed.\"\n\n\"The Council of Basel is having this same debate, though they frame it more carefully—they speak of 'reform in head and members,' of councils having authority to correct popes, of returning to early Church practices. They're trying to find a way to criticize the institution without being accused of denying the faith. It's a razor's edge.\"\n\nÁlvaro returns to his seat, speaking with quiet intensity. \"Your Majesty, you can hold these thoughts privately. You can act on them carefully—like convening the Toledo council to think through these questions with learned men. But you must never express them publicly, not even to bishops you trust completely. Why? Because once you've questioned whether the Vatican equals Christianity, someone will ask: 'Then where does your crusade's authority come from? If the Pope is just a man, why does his bull matter?'\"\n\nHe meets your eyes. \"The answer, of course, is that the crusade's authority comes from God, from the righteousness of the cause, from the faith of the crusaders. But most people can't think that abstractly. They need the Pope to be special, the Vatican to be sacred, or else the whole edifice of religious authority crumbles in their minds.\"\n\nÁlvaro's voice becomes even quieter. \"I'll tell you what I've concluded, after years of wrestling with this. The Church—capital C, the universal body of Christian believers—is holy and guided by the Holy Spirit. The Vatican—the human institution—is flawed and needs constant reform. The Pope is divinely inspired when teaching faith and morals, but he's still a man who can make political mistakes. And our duty is to serve the Church while working to reform the institution, without ever admitting publicly that we see a difference.\"\n\nHe pauses. \"It's exhausting. It requires constant mental gymnastics. But it's the only way to be both intellectually honest and politically safe.\"\n\n\"The Toledo council will help, Your Majesty. We can explore these questions in theological terms, with learned men who understand the nuances. We can develop a sophisticated Castilian position that respects papal authority while also asserting appropriate limits. But we must frame it all very, very carefully.\"\n\nÁlvaro stands. \"I'll draft the letters as we discussed. And Your Majesty? Thank you for trusting me with your thoughts. The fact that you're thinking about these things—really thinking, not just accepting what you're told—that's what makes you a good king. But please, for both our sakes, keep these questions between us until we have the theological council to explore them properly.\"\n\nHe gathers his papers. \"Is there anything else you need before I begin the drafting?\"",
