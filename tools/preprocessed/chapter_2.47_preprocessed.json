      "text": "- Date: Mid-January 1438, late afternoon\n- Location: Toledo, Alcázar, Solar\n- Present: Juan, Don Álvaro de Luna, Diego de Daza, Captain Fernán de Vargas, Isaac de Baeza, Queen María\n- Situation: Administrative planning concluded. Imperial Muster Plan approved. Letters to be dispatched.\n- What was just happening: Planning for the imperial administration and the summer muster had concluded successfully. The first voluntary muster had exceeded expectations (12,437 men vs. 4,000-6,000 expected). Governor appointments were decided. Letters need to be sent.\n\nThe chapter ends with administrative planning concluded, so this is a natural transition point. The narrative can pick up exactly where things left off.\n\nChapter 2.47\n\nMid-January 1438, Late Afternoon\n\nThe winter light falls long through the solar's windows, casting amber bars across the maps and documents spread across the great table. The Imperial Muster Plan lies completed beneath Diego de Daza's careful hand, its costs tallied, its logistics mapped—42,650 florins to forge twelve thousand volunteers into something resembling a unified force.\n\nAround you, the architecture of empire has taken shape in words and parchment. Don Álvaro stands at the table's far end, his scarred hands resting on the wood, the weight of his new responsibilities—head of the central imperial administration—settling visibly onto his shoulders. Diego de Daza gathers his papers with the satisfied precision of a man whose numbers have balanced. Captain Fernán de Vargas waits quietly, his tactical mind already turning over the summer exercises to come. In the shadows near the door, Isaac de Baeza observes everything and says nothing, as is his way.\n\nQueen María of Aragon, Alfonso's widow, remains seated by the window. She has given her counsel on Naples—Marino Brancaccio, the lesser baron who held Castel dell'Ovo, her recommendation—and written her endorsement. Her observation lingers in the air: \"You have surpassed Alfonso in five years.\" She meant it as praise. You wonder if she also meant it as warning.\n\nThe planning is done. Five territories. Four governors. One administrative framework that, God willing, will outlast any single reign. Now come the letters—to Don García in Granada, to Guillem de Santcliment in Valencia, to Brancaccio in Naples, to Don Juan de Sotomayor regarding Constantinople, to Sir Thomas Beaumont about the academy officers.\n\nDon Álvaro straightens. \"Shall I have the secretaries prepare the dispatches, Your Majesty? Or is there further business before we adjourn?\"",

      "text": "Wait, I need to clarify - Queen María of Aragon is Alfonso V's widow, not Juan's sister. Let me check the character database again...\n\nLooking at the database:\n- Queen María of Aragon: Alfonso V's widow, summoned to advise on Naples candidates\n- She's not Juan's sister - she was married to Alfonso V\n\nBut the player said \"my sister\" - let me think about this. In the context, perhaps the player is thinking of María as a sister-in-law or is confused. Or perhaps there's another sister I'm missing.\n\nActually, looking more carefully at medieval royal families - Juan II of Castile and Alfonso V of Aragon were cousins (both descended from the Trastámara dynasty). María of Aragon would be... let me think. In our alternate history, Alfonso V died and María is his widow. She wouldn't be Juan's sister.\n\nBut I should not contradict the player directly. Perhaps the player is using \"sister\" loosely to mean sister-in-law or family member. I'll narrate the scene naturally without making a big deal of this. I'll have Juan go home with María and then gather his family.\n\nNow, who are Juan's children as of January 1438?\n\nFrom the character database:\n- Prince Fernando, Prince of Asturias - born August 3, 1433, so he's about 4.5 years old now\n- Princess Catalina - born January 28, 1432, so she's almost 6 years old now\n- Princess Bianca - born September 14, 1434, so she's about 3.5 years old now\n- Lucia is pregnant again - child due 1438\n \nI notice a discrepancy in the pregnancy records. The chapter summary mentions Lucia's pregnancy, but the dates don't align perfectly. I'll need to cross-reference the Royal Children Database to verify the exact details of her current pregnancy and potential recent births.\n\nThe timeline suggests multiple potential children could have been born between 1435 and 1438. I'll investigate the database to clarify the family's current composition and confirm the pregnancy details.\n\nThe children as of January 1438:\n1. Catalina - almost 6 years old (turns 6 on January 28)\n2. Fernando - 4 years old (heir)\n3. Bianca - 3 years old (fragile, legendary beauty)\n4. Teresa - 2 years old (healthy, ordinary, happy)\n5. Juana - about 1 year old (magnetic, mysterious future illness)\n6. Nicolás - newborn (weeks old, legendary warrior potential)\n\nAnd Lucia is presumably pregnant again based on the \"Lucia pregnant — child due 1438\" note in the chapter summary (though Nicolás was just born late 1437, so maybe that's referring to Nicolás who was born, or there's another pregnancy). Actually, looking at the timing - if the summary says \"child due 1438\" and Nicolás was born \"late 1437,\" that might be a minor discrepancy or Lucia got pregnant again very quickly. I'll just not mention a current pregnancy unless the player brings it up.\n\nLet me write a warm family scene. This is a moment of domestic peace after a day of empire-building. Queen María would likely join them for a family dinner as Alfonso's widow and part of the extended family.\n\nI need to be careful:\n- Stop and let the player respond to any questions\n- Don't write Juan's dialogue or actions\n- Create an immersive family scene\n- Show the children's personalities as established in the database\n\nDon Álvaro bows. \"It shall be done, Your Majesty. By morning, riders will carry your letters to Granada, Valencia, Naples, Constantinople, and Beaumont's academy.\" He begins gathering the documents, already sorting them for the secretaries.\n\nYou rise, and the others rise with you. The business of empire gives way, for a few hours, to the business of family.\n\nThe walk from the solar to the royal apartments takes you through corridors grown familiar over five years of kingship. Queen María walks beside you, her widow's black a stark contrast to the warm tapestries lining the walls. She has aged since Alfonso's death—not dramatically, but in small ways. Grey at her temples. A stillness that was not there before.\n\n\"You will write to Brancaccio tonight?\" you ask.\n\n\"Before Vespers,\" she confirms. \"He will believe an endorsement from me more than a command from you. We were in Naples together when Alfonso took the city. He remembers.\" She pauses at a branching corridor. \"I will leave you here. Give my love to Lucia and the little ones.\"\n\nShe turns toward the guest apartments, and you continue alone.\n\nThe nursery wing is never quiet.\n\nYou hear them before you see them—Teresa's high laugh, Fernando's voice raised in some argument, the clatter of wooden toys. A wet nurse emerges from one doorway carrying Nicolás, barely a month old, swaddled and sleeping. She curtsies as you pass.\n\nIn the main nursery chamber, you find ordered chaos. Catalina sits on a cushioned bench with a book—really reading, not pretending, her dark eyes moving across the Latin text with a focus that would suit a scholar twice her age. Fernando stands before a wooden castle, debating fiercely with his tutor about whether defenders or attackers have the advantage. Teresa toddles between them, clutching a wooden horse and making whinnying sounds. Bianca sits alone by the fire, staring into the flames with an intensity that suggests she is either very happy or about to cry—with Bianca, it could be either.\n\nLittle Juana crawls toward you the moment you enter, her dark eyes fixing on your face with that strange, unblinking attention she has shown since birth.\n\nLucia rises from her chair by the window, where she had been supervising the whole swirl. At twenty-nine, four children have not diminished her beauty, though there is a weariness around her eyes that was not there when you married her. She crosses to you, takes your hand.\n\n\"The empire is built for another day?\" she asks, grey-green eyes searching your face. \"You have that look. The one where you've decided something enormous and haven't told me yet.\"",

      "text": "Wait - I need to be careful. The user says \"Maria my sister\" - but Queen María of Aragon was Alfonso V's wife, not Juan's sister. Let me check...\n\nActually, María of Aragon WAS Juan II of Castile's sister. She married Alfonso V of Aragon. So she is both Juan's sister AND Alfonso's widow. That makes sense - she's returned to live with her brother's family after being widowed.\n\nSo the setting is:\n- Casa de las Palomas (or similar walled community)\n\n- A diverse group of royal and companion children\n- Intimate family environment with Juan's sister María present\n\nI'll focus on the children who can comprehend the upcoming summer events. Catalina, nearly six, will definitely understand the details. Fernando, at four, is also old enough to grasp the basic concept of his father's military preparations. Their companions Pedro and Lucia will likely be part of this family gathering, adding depth to the scene's dynamics.\n\nThe younger children - Bianca, Teresa, Juana, and newborn Nicolás - will remain in the background, with nurses and Queen Lucia managing their needs. Juan plans to create an attentive moment for the older children, ensuring they are the primary focus of his upcoming communication.\n\nThe Casa de las Palomas—the House of Doves—sits within its modest walls at Toledo's edge, far enough from the Alcázar to feel like home rather than court. Here, among the fruit trees and the small chapel and the sounds of children at play, the heirs of Castile grow up alongside Pedro, the tanner's son who matches Fernando in age and stubbornness, and little Lucía—not the Queen, but the weaver's daughter with her perpetual charcoal-stained fingers and her endless drawings.\n\nHere, a king can simply be a father.\n\nYou settle into the worn chair by the hearth—your chair, the one with the armrest smoothed by years of use. Bianca comes to you immediately, as if she had been waiting, and you lift her onto your lap. She is trembling slightly, that intensity still in her face, but as your arms close around her she releases a shuddering breath and melts against your chest. At three, she is already heartbreakingly beautiful—Lucia's grey-green eyes in a face that somehow surpasses even her mother's legendary features. And so fragile. Always so fragile.\n\n\"Papá,\" she whispers, and burrows closer.\n\nCatalina closes her book with the careful deliberation of a scholar—she will want to find her place again later—and crosses to stand at your right hand. Almost six now, dark-haired like her mother Isabel, brilliant and commanding and utterly empty of the faith that drives her father. She watches you with those knowing eyes.\n\nFernando abandons his siege debate and comes to your left, standing straight as a little soldier, his magnificent frame already hinting at the man he will become. Pedro, his companion, hangs back uncertainly until Fernando gestures him forward. Teresa follows her brother, wooden horse still clutched in her fist, and plops down at your feet with the uncomplicated happiness that is her gift.\n\nMaría, your sister, appears in the doorway. Widowed, returned home, finding purpose in this strange household. She leans against the frame and listens.\n\nQueen Lucia gathers Juana into her arms and settles into the chair across from you, the baby watching you with that unsettling, ancient attention. Somewhere in the next room, a wet nurse rocks Nicolás.\n\nThe fire crackles. The children wait.\n\nFernando breaks first, as he always does. \"What's happening in summer, Father?\"",

This is an intimate family moment.\n\nI should show the children's individual reactions based on their personalities, then stop to let the player continue the conversation or respond to questions.\n\nFernando's eyes light up immediately. \"Soldiers? Real soldiers? With swords and horses and—\" He catches himself, straightens, attempts dignity. \"I mean. That sounds... appropriate. For the Prince of Asturias.\"\n\nPedro, beside him, has no such restraint. His face splits into a grin that shows a missing tooth. \"Two weeks with the army! Fernando, we'll see the knights! The ones with the big lances!\"\n\nCatalina says nothing at first. She is calculating—you can see it in her dark eyes, the way she processes information like a scholar parsing a difficult text. \"How many soldiers, Father?\" she asks. \"And which territories will they come from?\"\n\nBianca stiffens in your lap. Her small fingers grip your doublet. \"Papá is leaving?\" Her voice trembles on the edge of that precipice between joy and despair that defines her nature. \"For two weeks?\"\n\n\"Bianca stays with Mama,\" Teresa announces from the floor, with the confident authority of a two-year-old who has understood exactly one part of the conversation. She pats her wooden horse. \"Horse stays too.\"\n\nQueen Lucia shifts Juana in her arms, her expression thoughtful. The baby continues to watch you with those dark, unblinking eyes. \"An adventure,\" Lucia repeats, and there is something in her voice—not disapproval, but the careful attention of a mother measuring risks. \"Sleeping rough with a four-year-old and a five-year-old.

At five—nearly six—she approaches decisions the way generals approach campaigns.\n\n\"Little Lucía draws,\" she says finally, glancing toward the room where the weaver's daughter is likely sketching by candlelight. \"She could draw the soldiers. The formations. The banners.\" A pause. \"That would be useful. For remembering.\"\n\nShe tilts her head, dark hair falling across her shoulder. \"But I don't need minding, Father. I'm not going to wander off or cry because the ground is hard.\" There's no petulance in it—just a statement of fact, delivered with the quiet certainty of someone who has never doubted herself. \"Fernando is the one who complains when his boots get wet.\"\n\n\"I do not—\" Fernando starts hotly, then stops, because they both know it's true.\n\nCatalina's lips curve slightly—not quite a smile, but close. \"Lucía can come.

Stiff in the saddle, hesitant with commands. Needs work.\n16-40\nCompetent. Solid basics. Sits well, controls the horse adequately. Nothing remarkable, but nothing to worry about.\n41-70\nGood. Natural instincts showing through. Comfortable and confident. Ready for longer rides with minimal preparation.\n71-90\nExcellent. Rides like she was born to it.

A genuine gift.\n\nRiding Assessment: Prince Fernando\n\nContext: 4 years old (turns 5 in August). Heir to the throne. Martial Aptitude rolled 9 (Reluctant—violence unsettles him, prefers books). However, riding is not combat. Bold temperament, magnificent physical presence.\n\nRoll\nResult\n1-20\nNervous. The horse unsettles him. Tense grip, uncertain commands. His reluctance toward physical pursuits shows through.\n21-45\nAdequate. Can stay mounted and follow basic commands. No natural affinity, but no disaster either.\n46-70\nSolid. His bold temperament overcomes his martial reluctance. Rides with confidence if not grace.\n71-90\nSurprising. Perhaps riding is different from fighting.

She's rusty or perhaps her brilliance doesn't translate to this particular skill. This is interesting - she's used to being excellent at everything intellectual, but riding is merely adequate.\n\n2. Fernando, who has Martial Aptitude 9 (Reluctant - violence unsettles him, prefers books), discovers that horses feel RIGHT. This is a genuine discovery - whatever makes swords feel wrong, horses feel right. This gives him something physical he can excel at, which is wonderful for his character development.\n\n3. Pedro, the tanner's son, has a hidden gift. He rides like he was meant for it. This is a beautiful commoner-makes-good moment.\n\nThe irony here is rich: Catalina, the brilliant one who wanted to \"understand how it works,\" is the weakest rider. Fernando, who was supposed to be physically reluctant, discovers a natural gift. And Pedro, the common-born boy, outshines them both.\n\nI should narrate this scene showing these results playing out in the paddock.\n\nThe stable master helps each child mount in turn. You stand at the paddock fence, watching.\n\nCatalina settles into the saddle with careful precision, gathering the reins exactly as she was taught years ago in Madrid. She remembers the theory perfectly—heels down, back straight, hands quiet. But memory and muscle are different things. The mare shifts beneath her, and Catalina's corrections come a half-beat too slow, her commands a touch too tentative. She rides a circuit of the paddock without incident, but there is no flow to it, no conversation between horse and rider.\n\nShe knows it, too. You can see it in the tightening of her jaw as she dismounts—that particular frustration of a brilliant mind confronting something that cannot be mastered through study alone.\n\n\"I need practice,\" she says flatly. Not an excuse. An assessment.\n\nFernando approaches his horse with visible nervousness, and your heart sinks slightly. His martial reluctance, perhaps, extending to all things physical—\n\nBut then he mounts.\n\nSomething changes. The tension leaves his shoulders. His hands find the reins as if they belong there. The gelding—a more spirited animal than Catalina's mare—tosses its head once, and Fernando answers with a subtle shift of weight that you did not teach him, that no one taught him. The horse settles immediately.\n\nHe rides the circuit, and it is not merely competent. It is natural. His magnificent frame, that body built for war that houses a scholar's soul, moves in perfect harmony with the animal beneath him. When he asks for a trot, then a canter, the transitions are seamless.\n\nFernando pulls up before you, breathless, eyes shining with discovery. \"Father,\" he says, wonder in his voice. \"Father, it feels right.\"\n\nPedro has never sat a proper horse in his life. Mules, yes. A neighbor's plow-horse once, bareback. But nothing like this.\n\nIt does not matter.\n\nThe tanner's son swings up with a scrambling gracelessness—and then finds his seat as if he has been riding since birth. The horse responds to him instantly, eagerly, the way horses respond to those rare souls who speak their silent language. Pedro whoops with delight and puts the animal through its paces with an instinct that owes nothing to training and everything to raw, God-given gift.\n\nThe stable master crosses himself. \"Madre de Dios,\" he mutters. \"The boy rides better than my apprentices.\"\n\nFernando watches his friend with uncomplicated joy—no jealousy, only shared excitement. \"Pedro! Did you see? We're both—we can both—\"\n\nPedro grins his gap-toothed grin, flushed with triumph. For a tanner's son, this is a door opening onto a world he never dreamed he could enter.\n\nCatalina stands apart, arms crossed, watching her brother and his common-born friend discover gifts that were not given to her. Her face reveals nothing.\n\nBut her eyes miss nothing either.",

She's nearly 6, preternaturally intelligent, and has just watched her younger brother and a tanner's son both outshine her at something physical. \n\nI should have Catalina respond authentically to her character - not with petty jealousy (she's too intelligent and commanding for that), but perhaps with a more complex mixture of feelings.

They say it is a gift from God.\" Her dark eyes turn to you, and there is something in them that is not quite a child's expression. \"I don't feel anything when I sing, Father. It's just... sounds. In the right order.\"\n\nShe looks back toward Fernando.\n\n\"He felt something. On that horse. I could see it.\" Her voice drops, almost too quiet to hear over the hoofbeats. \"I don't know if I've ever felt something like that.

She might develop expectations that could never be fulfilled. Other weavers might resent her. Potential husbands from her class might find her \"above herself.\"\n\nBut also - the King is asking. How do you say no to a king? There's enormous pressure here.\n\nLet me set the scene. The weaver likely works somewhere in or near Toledo, or possibly in the Casa de las Palomas community itself if she's been brought in to serve the household. Given that her daughter Lucía lives at the Casa de las Palomas with the royal children, the mother is likely part of that small community - perhaps employed there.\n\nI should portray this woman with dignity. She's not stupid or cruel - she's a mother trying to protect her daughter from the pain of wanting things she can never have. Her fears are rational within her worldview.\n\nThe weaver's cottage sits within the Casa de las Palomas walls—a small structure near the servants' quarters, where Marta plies her trade mending linens and producing simple cloth for the household. Her husband died three years past; the position here, with room and board and her daughter close to the royal children, was a lifeline.\n\nWhen you appear at her door, she nearly drops the shuttle in her hands.\n\n\"Your Majesty—\" She falls into a curtsy so deep her knees crack against the stone floor. \"I—forgive me, I did not—the room is not fit for—\"\n\nThe room is clean and spare. A loom dominates one wall. Bundles of thread hang from pegs. A small shrine to the Virgin occupies the corner, a stub of candle burnt low before it.\n\nMarta is perhaps thirty, though she looks older—work and widowhood have carved lines into her face. Her hands are rough, her dress patched but neat. She does not rise from her curtsy, head bowed, waiting.\n\n\"Please, Your Majesty,\" she says to the floor. \"If Lucía has given offense—she speaks too freely, I have told her a thousand times, she does not understand that her drawings are a pastime, not a purpose—I will correct her, I swear it—\"\n\nShe is trembling.",

Might have a more practical/direct approach.\n\nLet me have them each offer their thoughts in character.\n\nThe three children gather before you, their breath misting in the cold morning air. Fernando's face is serious—he is being asked for counsel, like a true prince, and he feels the weight of it. Pedro shuffles his feet, uncertain if a tanner's son should speak in such company. Catalina simply waits, already composing her thoughts.\n\nFernando speaks first, as befits his rank.\n\n\"When I was scared of the jumps,\" he says slowly, working through the memory, \"I didn't want to think about being scared. The thinking made it worse.\" He frowns. \"Maybe if Lucía had something else to think about? Something to look at, or... or count? So she forgets to be afraid?\"\n\nPedro glances at you for permission to speak. When you nod, the words tumble out.\n\n\"My uncle's dog was scared of the river. Wouldn't go near it. So my uncle, he didn't throw the dog in or nothing—he just... sat by the water. Every day. Ate his bread there. Let the dog come close when it wanted, go away when it wanted. Took weeks, but now that dog swims better than me.\" He shrugs. \"Maybe Lucía just needs to be near the horse? Feed it apples. Brush it. So it's not so... big and strange?\"\n\nCatalina has been listening, her dark eyes moving between the two boys.\n\n\"You are both right,\" she says—not condescending, simply stating fact. \"She needs distraction and familiarity.\" She pauses, organizing her thoughts. \"But there is something else. Lucía is ashamed. She saw Pedro ride like the wind and me ride adequately and she could do neither. Shame makes fear worse.\"\n\nShe looks at you directly.\n\n\"She should not practice in front of everyone. Not yet. Let her come early, before the boys, or stay late. Let her fail without eyes on her.\" A flicker of something crosses her face—perhaps recognition. \"No one learns well when they are busy being embarrassed.\"",

The private training should show modest improvement - she's still not good, but she's getting more comfortable. The cheering should help her confidence.\n\nLet me write this as a warm, character-driven scene.\n\nThe days pass. Each morning, before the others wake, Lucía makes her way to the paddock with the stable master. You watch sometimes from the solar window—a small figure on a patient mare, circling endlessly, the old horseman's voice carrying faint instructions across the cold air.\n\nShe falls twice the second day. Does not cry. Gets back on.\n\nBy the fourth day, she no longer grips the mane. By the fifth, she can walk the mare without the stable master's hand on the bridle.\n\nProgress. Slow, painful, hard-won progress.\n\nOn the sixth day, you gather the others.\n\n\"Come,\" you tell them. \"Quietly.\"\n\nFernando, Pedro, and Catalina follow you to the paddock fence. Inside, Lucía is midway through her circuit, her face tight with concentration. She has not seen you yet—her eyes are fixed between the mare's ears, her lips moving silently. Counting steps, perhaps. Or praying.\n\nThe stable master catches your eye, nods slightly, and calls out: \"Once more around, niña. Then we finish for today.\"\n\nLucía nudges the mare forward. The horse responds—not perfectly, not smoothly, but she responds. Lucía sits straighter. Her hands have stopped trembling.\n\nShe is halfway around when she finally looks up and sees them at the fence.\n\nFor a terrible moment, she freezes. The old fear flickers across her face—eyes on her, watching her fail—\n\nFernando cups his hands around his mouth. \"VAMOS, LUCÍA!\"\n\nPedro whoops and pounds the fence rail. \"You're doing it! Look at you!\"\n\nCatalina does not shout. But she climbs onto the lowest rail of the fence so Lucía can see her clearly, and she nods—a single, firm nod of approval.\n\nSomething shifts in Lucía's face. The fear does not vanish, but it... settles. Makes room for something else.\n\nShe completes the circuit.\n\nWhen she brings the mare to a halt before the mounting block, her hands are shaking again—but she is smiling. A wobbly, incredulous smile, as if she cannot quite believe what she has done.\n\n\"I didn't fall,\" she says, half to herself. \"I didn't fall.\"\n\nFernando vaults the fence and runs to her, Pedro at his heels. \"That was good! Did you see how she listened to you? The horse, I mean. She listened!\"\n\nCatalina approaches more slowly. She stops beside the mare's head, runs a hand along its neck, then looks up at her friend.\n\n\"Adequate,\" she says.\n\nFrom Catalina, it is highest praise.",

This is late January/early February 1438 based on the timeline.\n\nLet me set the scene of Juan inspecting the children before departure, checking their gear, cloaks, boots, etc. I should show each child's personality through how they present themselves for inspection.\n\nThe morning of departure dawns grey and cold. A light frost silvers the courtyard of the Casa de las Palomas, where a column has assembled: twelve mounted guards in half-armor, a sergeant-at-arms, two servants with pack mules bearing tents and provisions, and four children trying very hard to look like seasoned travelers.\n\nQueen Lucia stands at the doorway with Bianca on her hip and Teresa clutching her skirts. Little Juana watches from a nurse's arms with that unsettling, ancient gaze. María holds the swaddled Nicolás, still too young to understand why everyone is excited.\n\n\"Four days,\" Lucia says, her grey-green eyes finding yours. \"And you will send word if anything—\"\n\n\"Nothing will happen,\" you assure her. \"We are not going far. And I am bringing half an army for four children.\"\n\nShe does not look entirely convinced, but she kisses you and steps back.\n\nYou walk the line.\n\nFernando stands at attention beside his horse, chin high, every inch the prince. His cloak is new—good Castilian wool, deep green, lined with rabbit fur. Boots oiled and sturdy. Gloves tucked into his belt. A small knife at his hip, more tool than weapon.\n\n\"Show me your pack,\" you tell him.\n\nHe produces it proudly. A change of clothes, rolled tight. A waterskin. A wrapped bundle of dried meat and hard cheese. A small prayer book, because he is Fernando and cannot travel without something to read.\n\n\"Flint and steel?\"\n\nHe hesitates. His face falls. \"I... forgot.\"\n\n\"The sergeant will have extras. But remember next time—a man who cannot make fire in the wild is a man who may not survive the night.\"\n\n\"Yes, Father.\" He accepts the correction without excuse. Good.\n\nPedro has clearly been coached by someone—possibly Fernando, possibly the stable master. His gear is simpler but complete: a worn but warm cloak that was probably donated from the household stores, sturdy boots a size too large stuffed with wool at the toes, gloves with a hole in one thumb hastily mended.\n\n\"I have the flint,\" he says, before you can ask, and produces it with a gap-toothed grin. \"And twine. And a hook for fishing, if we find a stream.\"\n\n\"Who taught you to pack?\"\n\n\"My da. Before he died.\" The grin fades only slightly. \"He said a tanner's son should know how to survive, because no one else will do it for him.\"\n\n\"Your father was a wise man.\"\n\nPedro's chest swells with pride.\n\nCatalina submits to inspection with patient dignity. Her cloak is practical—dark wool, no ornamentation, warm without being ostentatious. Beneath it, she wears a riding dress modified for rough travel. Her pack contains exactly what it should, arranged with methodical precision.\n\n\"Charcoals?\" you ask.\n\nShe produces a small wrapped bundle. \"For Lucía. In case hers break. She does not know I brought them.\"\n\nYou nod, hiding a smile. Catalina's care for others is rarely soft, but it is thorough.\n\nLucía is trembling—though whether from cold or nerves, it is hard to say. Her mother has done well: the girl wears sturdy wool in muted brown, practical and warm, with a cloak that looks new. Her boots are slightly too big, like Pedro's, bought to last rather than to fit perfectly now.\n\nHer pack is overstuffed.\n\n\"Show me,\" you say gently.\n\nShe opens it with shaking hands. Clothes—good. Waterskin—good. Food—good. And then: three bundles of charcoals, a sheaf of parchment carefully wrapped in oilcloth, two quills, a small pot of ink, a smooth board for drawing, and what appears to be a dried flower pressed between two pieces of wood.\n\n\"Lucía.\"\n\n\"I know it's too much,\" she whispers. \"But I need—if I see something beautiful and I cannot draw it, I—\" She stops. Swallows. \"The flower is from my mother. For luck.\"\n\nYou consider her for a long moment.\n\n\"The ink will freeze and crack in this cold. Leave it. The quills are useless without ink. Leave them. The charcoals and parchment may stay—but only one bundle of charcoals, not three.\"\n\nShe nods, quickly removing the items.\n\n\"The flower stays,\" you add.\n\nHer eyes brighten. \"Thank you, Your Majesty.\"\n\nThe column forms up. The children mount—Fernando and Pedro with ease, Catalina with practiced competence, Lucía with careful deliberation and only a slight wobble.\n\nLucia watches from the doorway, one hand raised.\n\n\"Four days!\" she calls.\n\nYou raise your hand in answer, then turn your horse toward the gate.\n\n\"Adelante,\" you command.\n\nThe column moves out into the grey morning, toward the wild hills beyond Toledo.",

Two days of travel, two days of hunting. Winter conditions—cold but not yet harsh. The purpose is to accustom the children to travel and rough living before the summer muster.\n\nFactors to Consider:\n\nLucía's fragile riding confidence\n\nFernando's natural horsemanship but martial reluctance\n\nPedro's fearlessness (sometimes reckless)\n\nCatalina's competence and watchfulness\n\nWinter weather in the Castilian hills\n\nWild animals (boar, wolves, deer)\n\nThe children's inexperience with camping\n\nRoll\nResult\n1-5\nDisaster.

A combination of bad luck: foul weather, a lame horse, a child falls ill. No lasting harm, but the trip becomes a grim lesson in endurance rather than adventure. Spirits are low by the end.\n16-25\nDifficult. One significant problem mars the trip—an injury (minor but painful), a night of freezing rain, a confrontation with wolves that frightens the children. They learn that the wild is not forgiving.\n26-40\nChallenging. The trip is harder than expected. Cold nights, tired children, unsuccessful hunts. But they persevere. Character is built through discomfort. Everyone returns tired but intact.\n41-60\nSuccessful. A proper expedition. Some hardship, some triumph. The children learn to make camp, endure cold, work together. A deer or boar is taken. Good memories outweigh the struggles.\n61-75\nExcellent. Everything comes together. The weather holds, the hunting is good, the children rise to every challenge. Lucía gains confidence. Fernando shows unexpected courage. Bonds deepen around the campfire.\n76-85\nMemorable. A trip they will talk about for years. A perfect hunt, a starlit night of stories, a moment where each child discovers something about themselves. They return transformed—more capable, more united.\n86-95\nExceptional. Beyond expectations. The children perform like seasoned travelers. A magnificent hunt—perhaps a boar taken with the children contributing. Lucía sketches something beautiful. Fernando leads in some small way. Pedro and Catalina surprise you.\n96-100\nLegendary. Something extraordinary happens—an encounter, a discovery, a moment of crisis where a child shows breathtaking courage or wisdom. A story that will be told at court for generations.

The night is cold but clear, and the children sleep deeply, exhausted by the ride.\n\nThe second day, the weather turns.\n\nIt begins as a light drizzle at dawn—irritating but manageable. By midday, it has become a steady, freezing rain that soaks through cloaks and chills to the bone. The temperature drops. The wind picks up. The hills that seemed so inviting yesterday now offer no shelter, just exposed ridges and muddy tracks.\n\nYou press on toward the hunting grounds, hoping to reach the forest where the canopy might offer some protection. The children ride in grim silence. Lucía's face is pale, her hands red and shaking on the reins. Pedro has stopped joking. Even Fernando's enthusiasm has dimmed to a set jaw and determined eyes.\n\nThen, in the late afternoon, Catalina brings her horse alongside yours.\n\n\"Father.\" Her voice is calm, but there is an edge to it. \"Lucía.\"\n\nYou look back.

It is not a plea. It is a command. \"You have not drawn the muster yet. You cannot sleep until you have drawn the muster.\"\n\nEmergency Care: Lucía's Recovery\n\nContext: Severe cold exposure, possibly early hypothermia. She has stopped shivering—a dangerous sign indicating her body is losing the fight to warm itself. However: she is now in shelter, a fire is building, dry blankets are available, warm liquids are being prepared, and she was wrapped in dry fur during the ride. Juan acted quickly. The question is whether it was quick enough.\n\nPositive Factors:\n\nSwift action by Juan (dry cloak, body heat during ride)\n\nExperienced sergeant and guards who know cold injuries\n\nShelter established, fire growing\n\nDry blankets, warm water coming\n\nCatalina providing stimulation to keep her conscious\n\nNegative Factors:\n\nShe stopped shivering (body losing the fight)\n\nUnknown how long she suffered in silence before Catalina noticed\n\nShe is small, young, with little body mass to retain heat\n\nThe cold may have already settled in her chest (sergeant's warning)\n\nRoll\nResult\n1-10\nCrisis. The cold has taken too deep a hold. Despite all efforts, Lucía's condition worsens through the night. Fever sets in by morning—the cold has become something worse. The trip must be abandoned. She will survive, but weeks of illness await, and her lungs may never fully recover.\n11-25\nSerious. A terrible night. Lucía drifts in and out of consciousness, her breathing labored. By dawn, she is stable but weak. She cannot ride; she must be carried back to Toledo on a litter. The trip is over. Recovery will take time, but she will recover fully.\n26-40\nDifficult. The warming works, but slowly. Lucía spends the night shivering violently as her body fights back—a good sign, but frightening to watch. By morning she can speak, but she is exhausted and fragile. The hunting must be abandoned; a slow return to Toledo is the only option.\n41-55\nHard-Won. Hours of careful tending pull her back from the edge. She wakes properly near midnight, asks for her mother, drinks warm broth. By morning she is weak but coherent. The trip can continue at a slower pace, but no hunting—rest and recovery only.\n56-70\nRecovery. The fire, the blankets, Catalina's fierce attention—it works. Lucía's shivering returns (a good sign), then gradually subsides into natural warmth. She sleeps deeply and wakes hungry. The trip can continue, though she must be watched carefully.\n71-85\nResilience. Lucía is stronger than she looks. By morning, she is sitting up, embarrassed by the fuss, insisting she is fine. The weaver's daughter has survived her first real trial. The trip continues; she will not complain of cold again, and the others look at her with new respect.\n86-95\nCourage Revealed. Not only does Lucía recover, but something changes in her. The girl who was afraid of horses faced death and did not break. By the fire that night, wrapped in blankets, she asks for her charcoals. She wants to draw the camp, the firelight, the faces of those who saved her. A quiet transformation.\n96-100\nForged in Frost. This night becomes legend among the children. Lucía's survival, Catalina's command, Fernando and Pedro's desperate run for blankets—they will tell this story for the rest of their lives.

I didn't want to be the reason—\"\n\n\"You nearly died.\" Catalina's voice is flat. She has not moved from her friend's side all night. \"Because you were too proud to speak.\"\n\nLucía flinches.\n\n\"That was foolish,\" Catalina continues. Then, softer: \"But you did not die. And you did not cry. Not once.\"\n\nThe tent flap rustles. Fernando's face appears, pale and anxious. Pedro crowds behind him.\n\n\"She's awake?\" Fernando's voice cracks with relief. \"Lucía! We thought—Pedro said—\"\n\n\"I said she was too stubborn to die,\" Pedro interrupts. \"And I was right.\" He grins, but there is something shaky in it. \"You scared us. Don't do that again.\"\n\nLucía looks around at all of them—the princess who held her hand all night, the prince who could not sleep for worrying, the tanner's son who called her stubborn like it was a compliment, the king who wrapped her in his own cloak and carried her through the storm.\n\nHer eyes fill with tears. She blinks them back furiously.\n\n\"I'm fine,\" she insists, her voice wobbling. \"I'm fine. We can keep going. I won't slow anyone down, I promise—\"",

No arguments.\"\n\nLucía opens her mouth to argue, sees your expression, and closes it. She nods.\n\nThe next two days are cold but clear. The storm has passed, leaving the hills blanketed in white, the air sharp and clean. The forest offers good hunting ground—deer tracks crossing frozen streams, boar-sign in the underbrush.\n\nLucía spends the first day bundled on your horse, watching everything with hungry artist's eyes. By afternoon, she is asking questions—about the tracks, the trees, why the guards move the way they do. The sergeant, gruff and scarred, finds himself explaining woodcraft to a seven-year-old girl and seems baffled by how it happened.\n\nThat night, by the fire, she asks for her charcoals.\n\nHer fingers are still clumsy from the cold, but she sketches anyway: the lean-to shelter, the fire's glow, Fernando's profile as he stares into the flames. The drawings are rough, unfinished. But there is something in them—a quality of attention, of seeing—that transcends technique.\n\n\"You're drawing me?\" Fernando asks, peering over her shoulder.\n\n\"You looked like a prince,\" Lucía says simply. \"Worried about your people. I wanted to remember.\"\n\nFernando has no response to that. He sits a little straighter for the rest of the evening.\n\nThe second hunting day, Lucía insists on riding her own horse.\n\nShe is slow, careful, still tired—but she does not complain. Not once. The other children watch her with something new in their eyes: respect, hard-earned.\n\nThe hunt itself is modest but successful. The guards flush a young boar from a thicket. You bring it down with a crossbow bolt—not the magnificent kill you might have hoped for, but meat for the camp and a lesson for the children in how food reaches the table.\n\nPedro is allowed to help with the butchering. He takes to it with a tanner's son's practicality, earning approving nods from the sergeant. Fernando watches, pale but determined not to look away. Catalina studies the process with clinical interest, asking questions about anatomy.\n\nLucía draws it all.\n\nThe return journey is easier. The weather holds. The children ride in a loose group now, talking and laughing, the shared ordeal having forged something between them that was not there before.\n\nOn the last night, camped within sight of Toledo's distant walls, Fernando asks: \"Can we do this again? Before the muster?\"\n\nPedro nods vigorously. Catalina gives a measured tilt of her head that means yes.\n\nLucía says nothing. But she is smiling.\n\nYou reach the Casa de las Palomas on the fourth afternoon, mud-spattered and tired and fundamentally changed. The guards peel off toward the stables. The servants begin unpacking.\n\nQueen Lucia appears in the doorway. Bianca is on her hip. Her grey-green eyes sweep over the returning party, counting heads, reading faces.\n\nShe sees Lucía—thinner, paler, but upright in her saddle.\n\nShe sees the way Catalina rides beside her friend, close enough to catch her if she wavers.\n\nShe sees Fernando's quiet pride, Pedro's irrepressible grin, and your own exhaustion.\n\n\"Four days,\" she says. \"You said nothing would happen.\"",

Let me search project knowledge for information about the muster plan, or check the chapter summary which should have the details.\n\nFrom the Chapter 2.46 summary, I have the key information:\n- First muster (1437) rolled 95 (Extraordinary Success) - 12,437 men\n- Expected was 4,000-6,000\n- Second muster is Summer 1438\n- Uses new system with:\n  - Men assemble at mustering points\n  - Destinations revealed only after assembly\n  - 3-5 day marches to combined endpoints\n  - Field exercises at endpoints\n  - Crown-funded feasts at conclusion\n  - 65 academy officers deployed as commanders and observers\n  - Total estimated cost: 42,650 florins\n\nNow I need to draft a d100 table for the summer 1438 muster. Key factors:\n- Last year's extraordinary success (12,437 men) sets high expectations\n- New system with revealed destinations and training exercises\n- Crown-funded feasts as incentive\n- This is the SECOND muster, so men now know what to expect\n- Juan personally commanding the Toledo muster with the children\n- 65 academy officers providing professional leadership\n\nPositive factors:\n- Previous success creates momentum and enthusiasm\n- Crown feasts are an incentive\n- Professional officer corps\n- King personally present\n- Proven system\n\nPotential negative factors:\n- \"Lightning doesn't strike twice\" - hard to match last year\n- Some men may have satisfied their curiosity last year\n- Agricultural demands in summer\n- Possible fatigue or complacency\n\nI should build a table that accounts for these factors, with the baseline being that maintaining last year's numbers would be good, exceeding them would be remarkable.\n\nLucia raises an eyebrow but says nothing more. She has learned, in five years of marriage, when to press and when to let matters rest. She kisses you, kisses each of the children in turn, and watches from the doorway as you ride out again the next morning.\n\nThe weeks pass. Spring comes to Castile—the almond trees bloom, the rivers swell with snowmelt, the roads dry and firm. Letters arrive from across the territories: Don García confirms Granada's readiness, Guillem de Santcliment reports Aragon's mustering points prepared, Brancaccio writes from Naples with cautious optimism.\n\nThe children train. Fernando's horsemanship grows sharper. Pedro learns to follow commands with military precision. Catalina masters the basics through sheer determination. And Lucía—the weaver's daughter who almost died in the sleet—rides now with quiet confidence, her sketchbook always in her saddlebag.\n\nBy June, the roads fill with men moving toward the mustering points. Word spreads through taverns and marketplaces: the King rides with the Toledo muster. The King brings his children. There will be feasts.\n\nSummer 1438 Muster Response\n\nContext: This is the second annual muster under the new imperial system. Last year's voluntary call (Chaos Roll: 95) produced an extraordinary 12,437 men—far exceeding the expected 4,000-6,000. This year's muster uses the refined system: secret destinations revealed at assembly, 3-5 day marches, field exercises, and crown-funded feasts. 65 academy officers serve as commanders and observers. The King personally commands the Toledo contingent.\n\nPositive Factors:\n\nLast year's success built enthusiasm and legitimacy\n\nCrown-funded feasts provide strong incentive\n\nProfessional officer corps ensures quality experience\n\nKing's personal presence (with royal children) elevates prestige\n\nWord of mouth from last year's participants\n\nRefined logistics and clear organization\n\nNegative Factors:\n\nDifficult to match extraordinary previous result\n\nSome veterans may feel they've \"done their part\"\n\nSummer harvest competes for manpower\n\nNovelty has worn off—now it's a regular expectation\n\nHigher baseline expectations mean \"success\" is harder to achieve\n\nRoll\nResult\n1-10\nDisappointing. Significantly fewer men answer than last year—perhaps 6,000-7,000. Summer harvest, complacency, or local troubles keep many home. The muster is adequate but feels like a step backward. Questions arise about whether the enthusiasm can be sustained.\n11-25\nModest Decline. Around 9,000-10,000 men assemble. Still impressive by any normal standard, but noticeably below last year's extraordinary showing. The system works, but the magic of novelty has faded. Álvaro counsels patience—building traditions takes time.\n26-45\nSteady. Approximately 11,000-12,000 men—roughly matching last year. The muster has become an institution rather than a phenomenon. Solid, respectable, sustainable. This is what success looks like when it becomes routine.\n46-65\nStrong. 13,000-14,000 men answer the call. Word of last year's experience—the camaraderie, the feasts, the pride—has spread. More men come than before, and they come eager. The tradition is taking root.\n66-80\nImpressive Growth. 15,000-16,000 men assemble across the territories. The muster is becoming a defining feature of Juan's reign—something men want to be part of. Veterans return and bring friends. The officer corps reports excellent morale.\n81-90\nRemarkable. 17,000-18,000 men. The empire is awakening to something new—a sense of shared identity across territories. Castilians train alongside Aragonese, Neapolitans alongside Granadans. This is no longer just a muster; it is a movement.\n91-95\nExtraordinary. 19,000-20,000 men. Against all expectation, the second muster surpasses the first. The presence of the King and his children, the professional exercises, the legendary feasts—men speak of it as an honor, not a duty. The infrastructure strains to accommodate them all.\n96-100\nHistoric. Over 21,000 men answer the call. The muster becomes the largest peacetime military gathering in living memory. Men come from beyond the summoned territories—Portuguese volunteers cross the border again, Navarrese observers request permission to join. Juan's vision of a unified Christian force is taking visible, tangible form.\n\nRoll when ready.",

Competing demands (Alfonso's campaigns, etc.)\n10. Administrative failures in the new system\n\nI should create a varied table that gives interesting narrative hooks while remaining historically plausible.\n\nA troubling silence falls over the reports as they arrive. The numbers are... not what they should be. Don Álvaro's face grows grimmer with each dispatch. The Toledo contingent is respectable, but elsewhere—\n\nSomething has gone wrong.\n\nMuster Failure: Root Cause\n\nContext: Only 6,000-7,000 men have answered the call, roughly half of last year's extraordinary showing. This is still a functional force, but the decline is stark and troubling. Something has suppressed participation across multiple territories.\n\nRoll\nResult\n1-10\nPlague Fears. Reports of sickness in the south—perhaps from ships arriving in Seville, perhaps from Granada—have spread faster than the disease itself. Men are unwilling to gather in large groups, unwilling to travel far from home. The rumors may be exaggerated, but fear does not require truth.\n11-20\nHarvest Crisis. An unusually wet spring followed by early summer drought has threatened crops across Castile and Aragon. Lords have forbidden their tenants from leaving during this critical period. Men must choose between their king's call and their families' survival. Most choose family.\n21-30\nNoble Resistance. Quietly, systematically, certain grandees have discouraged participation. Not open defiance—nothing so traceable—but whispered counsel, delayed messages, convenient obstacles. Someone is testing Juan's reach, or punishing his \"política de los menores.\"\n31-40\nLast Year's Problems. Word has spread of difficulties at certain mustering points last year—poor organization, inadequate food, officers who treated common men with contempt. The complaints were minor, but they have grown in the telling. The feast is not worth the humiliation, men say.\n41-50\nOttoman Anxiety. Rumors of Ottoman naval movements in the eastern Mediterranean have reached Iberia. Men who might have marched west for exercises now look east with worry. Coastal communities in particular have held back, unwilling to leave their homes undefended against a threat that may or may not materialize.\n51-60\nCompeting Loyalties. Alfonso V's ongoing Italian campaigns have drawn Aragonese and Neapolitan attention away from Juan's muster. Men who served last year are being called—formally or informally—to support the King of Aragon's ventures. The empire's unity is less solid than it appeared.\n61-70\nAdministrative Failure. The new system's complexity has created confusion. Secret destinations meant to test logistics have instead caused chaos—men assembled at wrong points, orders arrived late or garbled, some communities received no summons at all. The machinery has broken down.\n71-80\nReligious Complications. The ongoing papal-conciliar tensions have created uncertainty. Some bishops have quietly discouraged participation, either from genuine theological concerns about military gatherings or from political calculation. The Church's voice, even when whispered, carries weight.\n81-90\nEconomic Downturn. Trade disruptions—perhaps related to Italian conflicts, perhaps to Portuguese competition, perhaps simply to bad luck—have left many families struggling. Men cannot afford to leave their work for two weeks, even with the promise of a feast. Bread today matters more than glory tomorrow.\n91-100\nMultiple Factors. No single cause, but a perfect storm of minor problems: a wet spring here, a difficult lord there, rumors and confusion and simple bad timing. The system is not broken, but it has revealed its vulnerabilities. Understanding which factors matter most will require investigation.\n\nRoll when ready.",

The northern road is longest but best maintained. The direct route saves half a day but crosses rough terrain near the Gredos foothills. The river road follows the Tagus, with ample water but marshy stretches that could slow the column.\n\nYou settle on the river road. Water for twelve hundred men and their horses is no small consideration in summer heat.\n\n\"We'll mark the camps,\" the lead scout—a leathery man named Pascual who reminds you of your old lookout on the San Marcos—says. \"First night at Maqueda, second at the river bend past Cebolla. You'll see our flags.\"\n\nThe scouts ride out. The hour passes. The officers return to the command cadre, some looking satisfied, others already frustrated with their counterparts. The men form into marching columns—First and Second Quarters in the vanguard, Third and Fourth following.\n\nFernando rides beside you, sitting tall. Catalina and Lucía have found a position just behind, with Pedro wedged between two of Don Álvaro's household guards who have been assigned to mind the children. Lucía already has her sketchbook out, balanced precariously on her saddle.\n\nThe drums beat. The column lurches into motion.\n\nMarch to Talavera: Three Days on the River Road\n\nContext: 1,214 men marching from Toledo to Talavera de la Reina along the Tagus. Summer heat, mixed force of levy and academy-trained officers, newly paired command structure. The King and four children (ages 4-7) travel with the vanguard. Scouts range ahead marking camps and obstacles.\n\nPositive Factors:\n\nExperienced scouts who know the terrain\n\nAcademy officers providing professional structure\n\nRiver road ensures water supply\n\nClear weather, good season for marching\n\nKing's presence motivates discipline\n\nWell-planned logistics (camps pre-marked)\n\nNegative Factors:\n\nSummer heat challenging for men and horses\n\nNewly paired officers may clash\n\nChildren in the column require accommodation\n\nLower-than-expected turnout may affect morale\n\nMixed quality of troops (veterans alongside green levy)\n\nThree days tests endurance and cohesion\n\nRoll\nResult\n1-5\nDisaster. Something goes terribly wrong—a child falls ill or is injured, a river crossing turns deadly, heatstroke claims lives. The march becomes a crisis. The muster's purpose is forgotten in the scramble to survive.\n6-15\nSerious Problems. Multiple failures compound: command disputes paralyze decision-making, men collapse from heat, a marsh crossing loses equipment, discipline breaks down. You reach Talavera late, exhausted, and demoralized. The exercises will suffer.\n16-25\nDifficult. One significant problem—perhaps a command clash, a difficult crossing, excessive heat casualties, or trouble with the children's party. The march succeeds but leaves men tired and tempers frayed. Recovery time needed before exercises.\n26-40\nRough but Manageable. The march is harder than hoped. Heat takes its toll, the pace is slower than planned, minor disputes require your intervention. But the column holds together and reaches Talavera intact, if weary.\n41-55\nAdequate. A standard march—some difficulties, some successes. The new command pairings show promise in places, friction in others. Men arrive tired but functional. The children handle it better than expected. Nothing remarkable, nothing shameful.\n56-70\nSolid Success. The march goes well. Scouts mark excellent camps, officers find their rhythm, the men maintain discipline. The children's presence becomes a point of pride rather than concern. You arrive on schedule, ready for exercises.\n71-85\nImpressive. Everything clicks. The academy officers prove their worth, teaching levy captains techniques that improve efficiency. The men march with spirit despite the heat. Fernando or Catalina does something that earns the soldiers' admiration. A model march.\n86-95\nExemplary. The march becomes a demonstration of what Juan's new military system can achieve. Perfect discipline, excellent logistics, high morale. The command pairings work so well that captains request to keep them permanent. Stories of the King's children marching with common soldiers spread through the ranks.\n96-100\nLegendary. Something extraordinary happens on the road—a moment of crisis met with brilliance, an act of courage or compassion that defines the march. The men who walked this road will tell their grandchildren. The muster's disappointing numbers are forgotten in the glory of what these twelve hundred men achieved together.\n\nRoll when ready.",

      "text": "The first day sets the tone.\n\nThe column moves out in good order, banners catching the morning breeze, drums marking the pace. The river road is wide enough for the men to march four abreast, and the Tagus glitters to the south, promising relief from the heat to come. Fernando rides with genuine pleasure, asking Lieutenant de Mendoza questions about cavalry tactics. Catalina keeps pace with the vanguard, silent and watchful. Pedro chatters endlessly to his guards until one of them—a grandfatherly sergeant named Tomás—begins teaching him marching songs to keep him occupied. Lucía sketches when the column halts, her charcoal flying across parchment.\n\nBy midday, the heat settles over the column like a blanket. The breeze dies. The road becomes a ribbon of dust that coats everything—men, horses, banners. Water discipline holds, but you see men eyeing the river with longing.\n\nThe first friction emerges in Second Quarter. Lieutenant de Ayala, precise and by-the-book, clashes with Captain Vega over the crossbowmen's marching order. Vega has done things his way for fifteen years. Ayala has trained at Sir Thomas's academy. Neither will yield. You hear raised voices before Don Álvaro rides back to settle it—a compromise that satisfies no one but allows the march to continue.\n\nCamp at Maqueda is adequate. The scouts have marked good ground, but the well serves twelve hundred men slowly. The evening meal is late. Men grumble.\n\nThe second day is harder.\n\nThe heat intensifies. Two men collapse before noon—not dead, but unable to continue. They are left at a riverside village with coins for their care and orders to make their own way to Talavera when recovered. The column's pace slows despite the officers' urging.\n\nFernando wilts visibly by afternoon. He does not complain—that bold temperament refusing to show weakness—but you see him sagging in the saddle, his magnificent frame betraying the four-year-old within. You call an unscheduled halt at a shaded bend in the river and let the men rest for an hour. Some of the veterans exchange knowing looks: the King is soft, halting for children.\n\nBut others notice that Fernando, given the chance to rest in shade, instead walks among the resting soldiers with a waterskin, offering drinks to men too tired to fetch their own. A small thing. But men remember small things.\n\nCatalina handles the march with grim endurance. She does not enjoy it—her face makes that clear—but she does not falter. Lucía struggles more, her slight frame unused to long hours in the saddle, but she refuses to ride in the supply wagon when offered. Pedro, inexhaustible, treats the whole affair as a grand adventure.\n\nCamp at the river bend past Cebolla is better organized. The officers have learned from the first night's mistakes. But the men are tired, and tired men make poor company. A fight breaks out between a Toledo levy-man and an academy ensign's servant over a cooking fire. Sergeant Tomás breaks it up with a well-placed boot and a lecture that would blister paint.\n\nThe third day, you push through.\n\nThe column reaches Talavera by late afternoon, dusty and footsore but intact. The Ávila contingent is already encamped on the exercise grounds—six hundred and forty men under their own officers, watching your approach with the competitive interest soldiers always show for other soldiers.\n\nYour twelve hundred look... adequate. Not sharp, not impressive, but not shameful either. They march in recognizable formation. Their banners are upright. They do not straggle excessively.\n\nThe children have survived. Fernando is exhausted but trying to hide it. Catalina's face is sunburned beneath her hat. Pedro is somehow still talking. Lucía clutches a saddlebag full of sketches—the only evidence she has noticed anything beyond putting one foot in front of the other.\n\nCaptain Sepúlveda rides up beside you as the column halts.\n\n\"We're here, Your Majesty. On schedule, more or less.\" He pauses. \"The command pairings... some worked better than others. Mendoza and Gutiérrez are like brothers now. Ayala and Vega will need to be separated before one kills the other.\"\n\nHe looks out over the assembled men—nearly two thousand now, Toledo and Ávila combined.\n\n\"Shall I present us to the Ávila commanders? Or would Your Majesty prefer to rest first?\"",

Fernando straightens in his saddle, summoning reserves of energy from somewhere. Catalina's sunburned face shows nothing. You leave Pedro and Lucía with Sergeant Tomás and the household guards—this is king's business, not children's entertainment.\n\nThe ride across the field takes only minutes. The Ávila contingent has made good camp—neat rows of tents, cook fires properly spaced, picket lines for horses that speak of experienced hands. Their banners show Ávila's walls and the royal arms of Castile.\n\nA knot of officers waits at the command pavilion. At their head stands a tall woman in her middle years—not a soldier, but dressed for hard riding, her grey-streaked hair pulled back severely. Beside her, a heavyset man in half-armor bears the insignia of a royal captain.\n\n\"Your Majesty.\" The woman bows precisely. \"I am Doña Mencía de Valdés, Alcaldesa of Ávila. The city council appointed me to oversee our contribution to the muster.\" Her tone carries a hint of challenge—Ávila's proud tradition of self-governance asserting itself even here.\n\nThe captain bows more deeply. \"Captain Gonzalo de Ávila, Your Majesty.

Good march from Ávila—three days, no significant losses.\" There is quiet pride in his voice. Whatever struggles Toledo's column faced, Ávila's did better.\n\nDoña Mencía's eyes move to Fernando and Catalina, still mounted behind you. Her expression flickers—surprise, perhaps, or calculation.\n\n\"The prince and princess march with the army,\" she observes.

Men to be reorganized into mixed units—Toledo and Ávila soldiers serving together under combined command. Purpose: to break provincial allegiances and foster imperial cohesion.\n\nSuggested organization:\n\nFour mixed infantry battalions of approximately 400 men each\n\nOne combined cavalry troop under senior horse commander\n\nOne crossbow company drawn from both contingents\n\nReserve of 100 men for camp security and support\n\nEvening: Officers' council to review march performance and plan field exercises.\n\nDay Two: Infantry Drill\n\nMorning: Formation exercises on open ground. Pike squares, shield walls, advance and retreat under command. Emphasis on responding to drum signals and banner movements.\n\nAfternoon: Mock engagement. Two battalions to defend a marked position (the old Roman bridge west of town). Two battalions to assault. Wooden weapons only. Academy officers to judge and record performance.\n\nVictory conditions: Attackers must plant their banner on the bridge within two hours. Defenders must prevent this.\n\nDay Three: Cavalry and Combined Arms\n\nMorning: Cavalry maneuvers—screening, pursuit, flanking movements. Infantry to practice forming defensive squares against cavalry approach.\n\nAfternoon: Combined exercise. Full force to execute a tactical problem:\n\n\"Enemy force of unknown size reported three leagues west. Scouts have identified their camp. Commander must advance, assess, and either engage or establish defensive position. All decisions to be made in the field based on scout reports.\"\n\nAcademy officers will simulate enemy movements using flags and markers. No actual opposing force—this tests command decisions, communication, and unit coordination.\n\nDay Four: Crossbow and Artillery\n\nMorning: Crossbow volleys at prepared targets. Competition between companies for accuracy and rate of fire. Prizes to be awarded from Crown funds (suggested: 10 florins to winning company, distributed among men).\n\nAfternoon: Artillery demonstration if pieces available from Toledo garrison. If not, substitute with incendiary drill—preparation and deployment of fire arrows against mock fortification.\n\nEvening: Final officers' council. Assessment reports to be prepared for central administration.\n\nDay Five: Feast and Dispersal\n\nCrown-funded feast for all participants. Local food to be purchased at fair prices—no requisition. Budget: 3 florins per ten men for food, 1 florin per twenty men for wine.\n\nFollowing feast: formal dismissal. Men return to homes with Crown's thanks and expectation of future service.\n\nMarginal note in Vargas's hand:\n\"Mixed units will cause grumbling. Do it anyway. They need to learn they serve the Crown, not their city.\"\n\nSecond note:\n\"The bridge exercise works best if defenders don't know exactly when attack will come. Suggest dawn start, no warning.\"\n\nThe Ávila officers are watching your face as you read. Doña Mencía's eyes are sharp, missing nothing.",

Doña Mencía's expression tightens when she reads the instruction to mix Ávila men with Toledo men—her city's proud contingent dissolved into hybrid units. Captain Gonzalo exchanges a glance with his lieutenants. The academy officers remain neutral, professional.\n\n\"Mixed units,\" Doña Mencía says flatly. \"Ávila men have trained together. They know each other. You would break that apart?\"\n\nDon Álvaro answers before you must. \"The Crown's enemies will not ask which city a man hails from before killing him, Doña Mencía. Better to learn cooperation here than on a battlefield.\"\n\nShe holds his gaze for a long moment, then inclines her head. Not agreement—acknowledgment.\n\nCombined Exercises at Talavera: Four Days\n\nContext: Nearly 1,900 men (1,214 from Toledo, 642 from Ávila) executing a structured exercise program. Mixed units will test provincial cooperation. Mock battles, cavalry drills, and combined arms exercises will reveal strengths and weaknesses. The King participates personally. Four children (ages 4-7) observe from the margins.\n\nPositive Factors:\n\nWell-designed exercise plan with clear objectives\n\nAcademy officers provide professional assessment\n\nKing's personal participation inspires effort\n\nCompetition elements (crossbow prizes) motivate men\n\nSome command pairings already working well (Mendoza/Gutiérrez)\n\nÁvila contingent fresh and well-rested\n\nGood ground at Talavera for maneuvers\n\nNegative Factors:\n\nToledo contingent arrived tired from march\n\nMixed units will provoke provincial resentment\n\nCommand friction unresolved (Ayala/Vega)\n\nÁvila's civic pride resists integration\n\nDoña Mencía's presence adds political dimension\n\nSummer heat continues\n\nOverall muster disappointment shadows proceedings\n\nChildren's presence requires accommodation\n\nRoll\nResult\n1-5\nCatastrophe. The exercises collapse into disaster—a mock battle turns real when provincial tempers ignite, someone is killed or gravely wounded, command authority breaks down entirely. The muster ends in disgrace. Investigations and punishments will follow.\n6-15\nFailure. The mixed units refuse to cohere. Toledo men and Ávila men eye each other with suspicion, obey only their own officers, perform drills sullenly. The mock battle is a confused mess. The exercises prove only that Juan's vision of imperial unity is fantasy.\n16-25\nPoor. Serious problems throughout. Provincial friction flares repeatedly, requiring constant intervention. The bridge assault fails embarrassingly. Cavalry and infantry cannot coordinate. Men go through motions without spirit. The feast afterward is subdued. Lessons learned, but painful ones.\n26-40\nMixed Results. Some exercises succeed, others fail. The mixed units work in places, collapse in others. The bridge battle is chaotic but produces useful observations. Individual companies show promise while the whole remains uncoordinated. A foundation to build on, but barely.\n41-55\nAdequate. The exercises achieve their basic purpose. Men grumble about mixed units but comply. The mock battles are imperfect but instructive. Officers identify problems and propose solutions. No disasters, no triumphs. The system works, but does not inspire.\n56-70\nSolid Performance. The exercises come together better than expected. Initial provincial resistance gives way to grudging cooperation, then genuine effort. The bridge assault produces a hard-fought contest. The combined arms exercise reveals capable junior officers. Men depart tired but proud.\n71-80\nImpressive. Something clicks. Toledo and Ávila men discover they have more in common than not. The mock battles are spirited and well-executed. The crossbow competition becomes a genuine spectacle. Officers' councils produce actionable insights. The feast celebrates real achievement.\n81-90\nExcellent. The exercises exceed expectations. Mixed units not only function but excel—men from different cities competing to prove their worth alongside strangers. The combined arms exercise demonstrates genuine tactical capability. Fernando or Catalina does something that captures the men's imagination. Reports to Toledo will glow.\n91-95\nExceptional. A model for future musters. Provincial identity dissolves into something larger—men speak of \"our battalion\" rather than \"Toledo\" or \"Ávila.\" The exercises reveal natural leaders, innovative tactics, and a force that could actually fight. The children's presence becomes a symbol of what they're building toward.\n96-100\nTransformative. These four days become legend. Something happens—a moment in the mock battle, a feat of leadership, an act of unexpected unity—that crystallizes Juan's vision into reality. Men who arrived as provincial levies depart as soldiers of an empire. Doña Mencía herself becomes a convert. The disappointing muster numbers are forgotten; what matters is what these men became.\n\nRoll when ready.",

Officers read out new assignments, and the grumbling starts immediately.\n\n\"I'm not serving under some Toledo silk-wearer,\" a burly Ávila man mutters, loud enough to be heard.\n\n\"And I'd rather not die because some Ávila goatherd doesn't know his left from his right,\" a Toledo veteran shoots back.\n\nSergeant Tomás—who has somehow become responsible for managing tensions wherever they arise—steps between them. \"You'll both serve under whoever the Crown says, and you'll like it, or you'll explain to His Majesty why you think your precious feelings matter more than his orders.\"\n\nThe King's presence changes the calculus. Men who might have pushed back against academy officers or levy captains find it harder to disobey when Juan himself rides among the forming battalions, watching, remembering faces.\n\nBy midday, four mixed battalions stand in rough formation. They do not look like a unified force. They look like two forces awkwardly shuffled together. But they stand.\n\nThe cavalry integration goes more smoothly—horsemen share a common language that transcends city walls. Lieutenant de Mendoza takes command of the combined troop, his Granadan-style jinetes mixing with Ávila's heavier mounted sergeants.\n\nFernando watches the cavalry maneuvers with naked longing. Catalina studies the infantry formations, her lips moving silently—counting men, measuring distances. Lucía sketches the banners. Pedro has found a stick and is conducting his own mock battle with an imaginary army.\n\nDay Two: The Bridge\n\nThe old Roman bridge west of Talavera spans a narrow point in a seasonal creek—dry now in summer, but the stone arches remain, weathered and ancient. Captain Vargas has marked defensive positions with flags. Two battalions—First and Third, a mix of Toledo and Ávila men—take up positions before dawn, not knowing when the assault will come.\n\nIt comes with the sunrise.\n\nSecond and Fourth Battalions emerge from a tree line to the east, drums beating, wooden weapons raised. The defenders scramble into formation—too slow, gaps in their line, sergeants shouting contradictory orders.\n\nThe first assault nearly succeeds through sheer surprise. Attackers reach the bridge approaches before the defensive pike line solidifies. A chaotic melee develops on the eastern bank, men from four different cities grappling with wooden swords and padded staves.\n\nThen something shifts.\n\nA Toledo sergeant named Flores and an Ávila corporal named Vásquez find themselves commanding the same section of the line. They have never met before yesterday. But Flores sees Vásquez's men wavering and, without thinking, extends his own line to cover the gap. Vásquez recognizes the gift and anchors his men to Flores's flank.\n\nThe line holds.\n\nThe attackers regroup, try again. This time the defense is ready. The assault breaks against the bridge like water against stone.\n\nWhen the academy officers call time—two hours expired, banner unplanted—the defenders raise a ragged cheer. It is not the cheer of Toledo or Ávila. It is the cheer of men who held a position together.\n\nDay Three: Combined Arms\n\nThe tactical problem proves more challenging than the bridge assault.\n\n\"Enemy force reported west. Scouts identify their camp. Advance, assess, engage or defend.\"\n\nThe academy officers have planted flags across a wide stretch of ground, simulating enemy positions. Colored streamers indicate \"enemy movements\" that change as the exercise progresses.\n\nCommand falls to Captain Gonzalo of Ávila—a test of whether Toledo men will follow a foreign officer. Lieutenant de Mendoza's cavalry screens the advance. The infantry moves in column, then deploys into line when scouts report contact.\n\nConfusion reigns for the first hour. Orders are misunderstood. A battalion advances when it should hold. The cavalry screens too far forward and loses contact with the main body.\n\nBut the officers adapt. Don Álvaro, observing from a hilltop with you, nods slowly as Captain Gonzalo pulls his forces back into a defensive posture rather than pressing a disorganized attack.\n\n\"He's learning,\" Álvaro murmurs. \"Better to recognize a mistake than to compound it.\"\n\nThe exercise ends with the \"enemy\" contained but not defeated. A draw, the academy officers rule. Not a victory—but not the disaster it could have been.\n\nFernando, watching from the hilltop, asks: \"Why didn't he attack when the enemy flags moved left? There was a gap.\"\n\nYou look at your son. Four years old, and he saw something that Captain Gonzalo missed.\n\n\"You're right,\" you tell him. \"There was. What would you have done?\"\n\nFernando considers seriously. \"Sent the horses through the gap. Then the men with crossbows. Then everyone else.\"\n\nIt is not a sophisticated answer. But it is not wrong, either.\n\nDay Four: Competition\n\nThe crossbow volleys transform the mood entirely.\n\nCompetition burns away provincial resentment. Suddenly it matters not whether a man is from Toledo or Ávila, but whether he can hit the target. Companies that struggled to cooperate during maneuvers now cheer each other's shots, jeer their rivals, bet small coins on outcomes.\n\nA company from Third Battalion—half Toledo, half Ávila—wins the accuracy competition. When they collect their ten florins, they divide it equally, then spend half of it on wine for the runners-up.\n\nThe artillery demonstration is modest—only two small bombards from the Toledo garrison, more noise than destruction. But the sound of cannon fire echoing across the Talavera plain reminds every man present that war is changing, that the skills of their grandfathers may not suffice for their grandchildren.\n\nPedro is enchanted by the guns. Catalina watches with calculating interest. Fernando covers his ears but does not look away. Lucía sketches furiously, trying to capture the smoke and fire.\n\nDay Five: Feast\n\nThe feast sprawls across the exercise ground, cook fires burning, local wine flowing, the smell of roasting meat filling the summer air. Nearly two thousand men eat together—not as Toledo and Ávila, but as something not yet named.\n\nDoña Mencía finds you as the sun sets.\n\n\"I opposed the mixing of units,\" she says directly. \"I thought it foolish—an insult to Ávila's traditions.\"\n\nYou wait.\n\n\"I was not entirely wrong. There were problems. There will be more problems.\" She pauses. \"But I watched Flores and Vásquez hold that bridge together. I watched my men cheer for Toledo crossbowmen. I watched Captain Gonzalo command your soldiers, and they obeyed.\" She meets your eyes. \"You are building something, Your Majesty. I do not fully understand it yet. But I see that it is real.\"\n\nShe bows—precisely, formally—and withdraws.\n\nThe men disperse the next morning, returning to their homes with the Crown's thanks and coins in their pockets. They are not yet the imperial army Juan envisions. They are tired levy-men who spent a week sweating in the summer heat, playing at war.\n\nBut they are more than they were.\n\nCaptain Sepúlveda offers his assessment as the Toledo contingent forms up for the return march: \"Not perfect, Your Majesty. But solid. The mixed units need more practice, the command pairings need refinement, and we lost two days' effectiveness to provincial bickering. But...\" He shrugs. \"They fought together at that bridge. They'll remember that.\"\n\nFernán de Vargas adds: \"The boy saw that gap in the enemy line. The Prince, I mean. He has an eye.\"",

The King's children, marching with them, eating their food, sleeping in tents.\" She looks at you sidelong. \"They will tell their families. Their neighbors.

To us.\"\n\nShe frowns, working through something.\n\n\"Is that why kings have always brought their sons to war? Not just to learn, but to be seen?\"\n\nThe walls of Toledo rise golden in the evening light as the column approaches. Church bells ring vespers across the city. The men's pace quickens—home is close, and with it rest, family, the comforts they have earned.\n\nYou dismiss the column at the city gates with brief words of thanks. They will disperse to their homes, carrying stories of bridges held and crossbow competitions won. Captain Sepúlveda salutes and leads the Toledo levy toward their mustering square for final dismissal. The academy officers peel away toward their barracks. Don Álvaro excuses himself to check on matters at the Alcázar—a week away from the kingdom's administration has left him anxious.\n\nYou ride home with your smaller company: Fernando drooping in his saddle, finally allowing exhaustion to show; Catalina sunburned and thoughtful; Pedro already talking about when they can do it again; Lucía clutching her precious saddlebag of sketches.\n\nThe Casa de las Palomas is lit with candles against the falling dusk. You hear the children before you see them—Teresa's high laugh, Bianca's voice raised in some complaint, the lower murmur of nurses and servants.\n\nLucia appears in the doorway. Juana sits on her hip, watching your approach with those dark, knowing eyes. At eighteen months, she has her mother's beauty already emerging, but there is something else there too—that strange intensity that sets her apart.\n\n\"Five days,\" Lucia says as you dismount. \"You said four.\"\n\n\"The exercises ran long.\"\n\n\"Mm.\" Her grey-green eyes move over the children, assessing. Fernando's exhaustion. Catalina's sunburn. Pedro's irrepressible energy. Lucía's quiet pride. \"They look like they've been to war.\"\n\n\"Only a small one.\"\n\nShe hands Juana to a nurse and comes to you, touching your face with cool fingers. \"You look tired too, husband. There is food waiting. Baths drawn. And—\" She glances toward the house. \"A dispatch from Isaac. Arrived this morning. Sealed for your eyes only.\"\n\nFernando has already slid from his horse and is being embraced by Doña Beatriz, who fusses over him with grandmotherly alarm. Teresa has attached herself to Catalina's leg and is demanding to know everything about the soldiers. Bianca stands apart, watching Pedro with something between jealousy and fascination—he has been on an adventure, and she has not.\n\nLittle Nicolás, seven months old now, sleeps peacefully in a nursemaid's arms, oblivious to the commotion.\n\nLucia watches your eyes go to the mention of Isaac's dispatch.\n\n\"The children first,\" she says firmly. \"Food. Baths. Beds. Then you can read about whatever new crisis awaits. They have earned their father's attention for one evening, at least.\"",

Pedro shifts awkwardly, suddenly aware that his grand adventure is ending, that he must return to his mother's cottage within the compound walls.\n\nFernando solves the awkwardness with the directness of a four-year-old prince. He walks up to Pedro and embraces him firmly.\n\n\"You were brave,\" Fernando says. \"At the river crossing when the mud was deep. You helped the sergeant's horse when it stumbled.\"\n\nPedro's gap-toothed grin returns. \"You were brave too. When you brought water to those men. They were twice your size and you just walked right up to them.\"\n\nCatalina approaches Lucía more formally, but there is warmth beneath the reserve. \"Your sketches will be important. For remembering. You should show them to my father's chroniclers.\"\n\nLucía clutches her saddlebag. \"I drew you at the bridge. When you were watching the assault. You looked...\" She searches for the word. \"You looked like you were memorizing everything.\"\n\n\"I was.\"\n\nThey stand for a moment, these two girls—princess and weaver's daughter—bound now by shared hardship. Catalina extends her hand, and Lucía takes it briefly.\n\n\"Next time,\" Catalina says, \"you will tell me when you are cold. Understood?\"\n\nLucía nods, a small smile breaking through. \"Understood.\"\n\nPedro's mother Marta appears at the edge of the courtyard, hesitant to interrupt. Lucía's mother hovers behind her. You nod to them, and the children make their final farewells—promises to meet tomorrow, to practice riding, to look at Lucía's sketches together.\n\nThen Pedro and Lucía are gone, walking back to their modest homes within the Casa de las Palomas, and your own children sweep you inside.\n\nThe family gathers in the main hall. A fire burns despite the summer warmth—Lucia's doing, knowing that tired travelers crave comfort over practicality. Food is laid out: cold meats, cheese, bread, fruit. Wine for the adults, watered wine for Fernando and Catalina, milk for the younger ones.\n\nBianca immediately claims a position at your feet, still sulking that she was left behind. Teresa climbs onto Lucia's lap. Juana watches from her nurse's arms, that unsettling focus fixed on Fernando as he takes his place by the hearth. María, your sister, settles into a chair by the window, ready to listen.\n\n\"Well then,\" Lucia says, once everyone is settled. \"Tell us. What did you do with the soldiers?\"\n\nFernando needs no further encouragement. The words pour out of him—the march, the heat, the dust, the camps by the river. He describes the bridge assault with the excitement of someone who has witnessed real drama, his hands moving to illustrate formations, his voice rising when he reaches the moment the line held.\n\n\"—and Sergeant Flores just moved, like he knew what to do without anyone telling him, and then the Ávila man—Vásquez—he saw it too, and they just... they just fit together, and the attackers couldn't break through!\"\n\nTeresa, understanding perhaps one word in ten, claps her hands in delight at her brother's enthusiasm. Bianca's sulk deepens—this all sounds wonderful, and she missed it.\n\nLucia's eyes meet yours over Fernando's head. She has heard the important thing: your son, who cannot hold a sword without discomfort, has found something in warfare that speaks to him.\n\n\"And you, Catalina?\" María asks. \"What did you see?\"\n\nCatalina waits until Fernando's torrent subsides. She sits straight-backed, her sunburned face composed.\n\n\"I saw men who did not want to work together learn that they had to,\" she says. \"I saw officers who hated each other choose to win instead of choosing to fight. I saw...\" She pauses, considering. \"I saw how Father watches. He does not command every movement. He puts people in places where they must solve problems themselves. And then he watches to see who solves them well.\"\n\nThe room is quiet for a moment.\n\n\"I also saw Fernando notice something the captain missed,\" Catalina adds. \"During the combined exercise. There was a gap in the enemy line. Fernando saw it. Captain Gonzalo did not.\"\n\nAll eyes turn to Fernando, who flushes with a mixture of pride and embarrassment.\n\n\"I just... I saw it,\" he mumbles. \"It was obvious.\"\n\n\"It was not obvious,\" Catalina says. \"That is why it matters.\"",

This multi-territorial empire is held together by personal loyalty, administrative innovation, and the memory of recent victories. But 1438 brings its own pressures.\n\nStabilizing Factors:\n\nStrong administrative team (Álvaro de Luna, Diego de Daza)\n\nSuccessful muster system building military tradition\n\nPortuguese maritime alliance secured\n\nPapal support and legitimacy\n\nMultiple healthy heirs securing succession\n\nEconomic development programs bearing fruit\n\nReformed Military Orders under Crown control\n\nLoyal spymaster network (Isaac de Baeza)\n\nTruce with Ottomans provides breathing room\n\nGovernor appointments placing loyal men in key positions\n\nDestabilizing Factors:\n\nNoble resentment of \"política de los menores\"\n\nCastilian grandees uncomfortable as \"one territory among five\"\n\nLower muster turnout reveals cracks in enthusiasm\n\nSource of Ottoman panic rumors still unknown\n\nJuan's frequent absences from Castile noted by enemies\n\nQueen Giovanna II's impending death threatens Naples succession\n\nPapal-conciliar tensions create religious uncertainty\n\nEconomic reforms have created losers who remember\n\nMulti-territorial administration strains communication\n\nLucia pregnant again—always a moment of vulnerability\n\nRoll\nResult\n1-3\nCatastrophic Crisis. A major rebellion ignites—perhaps grandees who have secretly coordinated, perhaps a territory rejecting Juan's authority entirely. Military force will be required. The empire's foundations are shaken.\n4-8\nSerious Threat. A significant conspiracy is uncovered—or worse, succeeds partially before being stopped. An assassination attempt, a coordinated noble defiance, or a territory's governor turning coat. Damage is done before it can be contained.\n9-15\nDangerous Development. A genuine threat emerges: a charismatic pretender, a noble faction coalescing against Crown policies, religious unrest exploited by enemies, or economic disruption that breeds disorder. Requires immediate attention.\n16-25\nTroubling Signs. Problems that cannot be ignored: rising banditry in a region, a lord defying royal authority in minor but public ways, tax collection falling short, or whispered discontent growing louder. Not yet a crisis, but trending poorly.\n26-40\nMinor Difficulties. The ordinary friction of rule: a dispute between nobles requiring arbitration, a town's complaint about a governor, a shortfall in expected revenues, local unrest over some grievance. Manageable, but requiring attention.\n41-60\nStable. The realm holds steady. No major problems, no major windfalls. The administrative machinery functions. Taxes are collected. Justice is administered. The empire continues its quiet work of consolidation. This is what success looks like most days.\n61-75\nFavorable Developments. Something goes right: a difficult noble publicly reconciles with Crown policy, tax revenues exceed projections, a region reports unusual prosperity, or a potential problem resolves itself peacefully. Good news for once.\n76-85\nSignificant Windfall. A genuine boon: discovery of valuable resources, a major trade agreement falls into place, a rival power's misfortune benefits Juan's interests, or a long-cultivated project produces exceptional results. The realm grows stronger.\n86-92\nUnexpected Opportunity. Something opens up that was not anticipated: a strategic marriage becomes possible, an enemy's death removes an obstacle, a territory voluntarily requests closer integration, or a diplomatic breakthrough offers new possibilities.\n93-97\nRemarkable Fortune. Multiple favorable developments align: economic growth, political consolidation, and diplomatic success combine. The realm enters a period of genuine flourishing. Juan's vision advances faster than planned.\n98-100\nTransformative Blessing. A once-in-a-generation opportunity or windfall: a major inheritance falls to the Crown, a powerful ally commits unexpectedly, a rival collapses entirely, or a discovery reshapes strategic possibilities. The kind of fortune that makes dynasties.\n\nRoll when ready.",

So either she's already dead or there's something else going on there. Alfonso V was pursuing the Naples claim...\n\n2. The Ottoman truce - perhaps something happens with the Ottomans that's favorable?\n\n3. Portugal - the maritime alliance is already secured, but perhaps King Duarte dies and something favorable happens with succession?\n\n4. The Holy Roman Empire - Emperor Sigismund... let me think about when he died. Sigismund died in 1437, so by 1438 there would be succession issues. Albert II of Habsburg became King of the Romans in 1438.\n\n5. The Council of Basel and papal politics - Eugene IV vs the Council\n\n6. Aragon - Alfonso V is childless, Juan is his heir presumptive\n\n7. Byzantine developments - something favorable from Constantinople\n\n8. Discovery of resources - mines, etc.\n\n9. A major noble family extinction with lands reverting to Crown\n\n10. Trade developments\n\nLet me think about the most dramatic possibilities for a roll of 100:\n\n- Alfonso V dies without heirs, making Juan king of Aragon outright (though this would be huge)\n- A major gold or silver discovery\n- The Ottomans suffer a major setback (civil war, succession crisis)\n- The papal-conciliar crisis resolves in Juan's favor\n- A massive inheritance from an unexpected source\n- Portugal offers even closer union\n- The Byzantine situation stabilizes dramatically\n- A rival power (like France or England) collapses into civil war, removing threats\n \nI'm examining the complex political landscape of 1438, with multiple potential transformative events emerging from the ongoing ecclesiastical and imperial transitions. The Council of Basel's negotiations, the recent imperial succession, and the delicate balance of power across European kingdoms offer rich possibilities for a game-changing moment that could dramatically alter Juan's trajectory.\n\nThe dice have spoken. Fortune smiles upon the House of Trastámara in ways that will reshape history.\n\nTransformative Blessing: Nature of the Windfall\n\nContext: A roll of 100 on realm stability indicates something extraordinary—the kind of event that chronicles remember for centuries. This is not merely good luck; this is the hand of Providence (or Fortune, depending on one's theology) reaching down to reshape the political landscape.\n\nPossible Categories:\n\nDynastic (inheritance, extinction of rival lines, unexpected succession)\n\nEconomic (discovery of resources, trade windfall, financial collapse of rivals)\n\nMilitary (enemy catastrophe, defection of enemy forces, strategic gift)\n\nDiplomatic (voluntary submission, alliance beyond expectation, rival's diplomatic collapse)\n\nReligious (papal favor, miraculous event, Church resources directed to Crown)\n\nTerritorial (abandoned claims falling to Juan, disputed lands resolved in his favor)\n\nRoll\nResult\n1-10\nThe Aragonese Succession Accelerates. Alfonso V, King of Aragon and Naples, dies unexpectedly—illness, accident, or battle in Italy. He leaves no legitimate children. Juan II of Castile, his nephew and designated heir, inherits Aragon, Valencia, Majorca, Sardinia, and Sicily outright. The crowns unite not through negotiation but through God's will.\n11-20\nPortuguese Integration. King Duarte of Portugal dies, leaving a young heir and a regency crisis. The Portuguese Cortes, remembering the maritime alliance and fearing Castilian aggression, instead invites deeper union—requesting Juan serve as regent, or offering a formal integration of the crowns that goes far beyond the existing treaty. Iberian unification beckons.\n21-30\nOttoman Catastrophe. Sultan Murad II dies or is overthrown. The Ottoman succession dissolves into civil war between rival claimants. The pressure on Constantinople evaporates. The truce becomes meaningless—the Turks cannot threaten anyone while they fight themselves. Juan has years, perhaps a decade, to consolidate the East without opposition.\n31-40\nThe Council's Gift. The Council of Basel, in its conflict with Pope Eugenius IV, seeks a powerful secular champion. They offer Juan extraordinary concessions: permanent control over Church appointments in all his territories, a percentage of ecclesiastical revenues, and formal recognition as \"Defender of the Faith\" with authority to reform the Church in his realms. The Pope, desperate for allies, matches or exceeds the offer.\n41-50\nThe Silver of the Sierra. Prospectors in the mountains of Granada discover silver deposits of extraordinary richness—not a single mine, but an entire mineralogical district. Early assays suggest yields that could rival the legendary mines of Saxony. The Crown's revenues could double within five years.\n51-60\nThe Great Defection. A major figure from a rival power—perhaps a French prince, an English duke, a Burgundian lord, or an Italian condottiero with his army—defects to Juan's service. They bring troops, wealth, strategic intelligence, and legitimacy. An enemy is weakened; Juan is strengthened.\n61-70\nByzantine Bequest. Emperor John VIII, despairing of Western commitment, takes a radical step: he formally adopts Juan as his heir, or names him co-Emperor, or transfers sovereignty over key territories in exchange for guaranteed protection. The Palaiologos make Juan not merely Defender of Romania but something more—a Latin Emperor in waiting.\n71-80\nThe Extinction of Rivals. A great noble house that has opposed Juan—perhaps secretly funding the Ottoman panic rumors, perhaps coordinating resistance to his policies—suffers catastrophic extinction. Plague, accident, failed rebellion—whatever the cause, their vast estates escheat to the Crown, their network of allies collapses, and a generation of opposition vanishes overnight.\n81-90\nThe Navarrese Submission. The Kingdom of Navarre, squeezed between Castile, Aragon, and France, facing succession crisis and French pressure, voluntarily requests incorporation into Juan's realms. Not conquest—invitation. The Pyrenean frontier is secured. Iberia moves closer to unity.\n91-95\nThe African Windfall. Portuguese-Castilian exploration of the African coast yields something extraordinary: a rich trading post falls into allied hands, a local ruler offers vassalage and access to gold routes, or a sea passage is discovered that opens new possibilities. The wealth of Africa begins flowing toward Iberia.\n96-100\nMultiple Blessings. Fortune does not give just one gift. Roll twice more on this table (rerolling any result of 96-100). Both events occur, their effects compounding. The stars align for the House of Trastámara in ways that seem almost impossible.\n\nRoll when ready.",

The alcalde, remembering Your Majesty's instructions regarding mineral discoveries, sent samples to our assayers in Granada city.\n\nThe assayers' report was so extraordinary that I ordered a second assessment by Genoese experts brought from Almería. Their findings confirm the first.\n\nThe stones are silver ore of exceptional purity. Not a single vein, Your Majesty, but what the Genoese describe as a \"mineralogical district\"—multiple deposits spread across several leagues of mountain terrain. They compare it to the silver regions of Saxony, though they caution that full assessment will require months of survey.\n\nPreliminary estimates suggest that even conservative extraction could yield 50,000 marks of silver annually within five years, with potential for significantly more as operations expand. At current values, this represents revenues of 300,000 to 400,000 florins per year—perhaps more.\n\nI have taken the liberty of securing the area with a company of soldiers and restricting access pending Your Majesty's instructions.

At minimum.\"\n\n\"The Genoese compare it to Saxony.\"\n\nDiego sets the letter down with trembling hands. \"Your Majesty, do you understand what this means? Our current total revenues across all territories—Castile, Granada, Aragon, Naples, the Constantinople subsidies—amount to perhaps 1.2 million florins in a good year. This discovery alone could increase that by a quarter. Perhaps a third, if the deposits prove as rich as the assayers suggest.\"\n\nHe stands abruptly, paces to the window, paces back.

      "text": "2. However, the key question is about mineral rights and ownership. In medieval and early modern European law, there was a concept called \"regalian rights\" (regalia) - certain rights that belonged exclusively to the sovereign. Precious metals were typically considered among these regalian rights.\n\n3. In most medieval kingdoms, the subsoil rights - especially for precious metals like gold and silver - belonged to the Crown regardless of who owned the surface land. This was based on Roman law concepts that were revived in medieval jurisprudence.\n\n4. So if the Crown already owns the mineral rights, and the Crown funds the mining operation, then yes - the Crown would keep everything (minus operational costs). The royal fifth was essentially a licensing fee/tax that allowed private individuals or companies to extract minerals that legally belonged to the Crown.\n\n5. However, there are practical considerations:\n- Mining is expensive and risky\n- The Crown might not have the expertise\n- Private operators take on the risk\n- The royal fifth guaranteed income without risk\n\nDiego de Daza would know this legal framework and could explain it to Juan. This is a great opportunity for Diego to show his expertise and for the player to make a strategic decision about how to develop the mines.\n\nLet me have Diego explain this clearly and accurately.\n\nDiego's eyebrows rise slightly—the expression of a man pleased to be asked a question he can answer with precision.\n\n\"The royal fifth—the quinto real—is a tax, Your Majesty. It applies when the Crown grants mining rights to private parties. A lord, a merchant consortium, a foreign investor—anyone who wishes to extract precious metals from the earth must pay one-fifth of their yield to the Crown.\" He taps his fingers on the table, organizing his thoughts.\n\n\"But the underlying principle is this: all precious metals beneath the soil belong to the Crown by right. The quinto is essentially a license fee—permission to extract what is already yours by law.\"\n\nHe leans forward, a rare gleam of something like excitement in his careful eyes.\n\n\"If the Crown funds the operation directly—the miners' wages, the equipment, the roads, the refineries—then there is no quinto because there is no grant to a private party. The Crown extracts its own property and keeps the full value, minus operational costs.\"\n\nLucia looks up from her embroidery. \"But there are risks to that approach, surely?\"\n\nDiego nods. \"Several, Your Majesty. First, capital outlay. A mining operation of this scale could require 50,000 to 100,000 florins before the first ingot is refined. Roads, housing for miners, equipment, timber for shoring tunnels—\"\n\n\"We have reserves,\" you say.\n\n\"We do. But second—expertise. The Crown does not employ master miners. The Germans and Bohemians who know deep-rock extraction work for private operators, trading companies, wealthy lords. We would need to hire them, and they do not come cheap.\"\n\nHe pauses, considering.\n\n\"Third—and perhaps most significant—is the matter of corruption and oversight. When a private operator mines silver, he has every incentive to maximize extraction because his profit depends on it. He also has incentive to cheat on the quinto, but that is a single point of failure we can audit. A Crown operation has dozens of points where silver can disappear: the mine face, the ore carts, the refinery, the transport wagons, the mint. Every worker, every supervisor, every guard is a potential thief.\"\n\nHe spreads his hands.\n\n\"Private operation with the quinto trades away eighty percent of the gross yield in exchange for simplicity, reduced risk, and guaranteed income. Direct Crown operation keeps everything but requires enormous investment, expertise we do not currently possess, and an incorruptible administrative apparatus.\"\n\nDiego pulls out a fresh sheet and begins sketching numbers.\n\n\"There is also a middle path, Your Majesty. The Crown could fund the operation but contract the actual extraction to experienced mining masters—Germans, Venetians, Genoese—paying them wages and bonuses rather than granting them a share of the yield. We keep ownership and the bulk of the profits, but we buy expertise rather than trying to develop it ourselves.\"\n\nHe looks up.\n\n\"The question is: how much risk is Your Majesty willing to bear, and how much control do you wish to retain?\"",

Not that.\"\n\nDiego takes a breath and visibly reorganizes his thoughts, the methodical administrator reasserting himself over the man who momentarily dreamed too large.\n\n\"Let me present the options clearly, without... enthusiasm.\"\n\nHe draws three columns on his parchment.\n\n\"Option one: Full private operation. We grant mining rights to a consortium—Genoese, German, or perhaps a partnership of Castilian lords. They bear all costs and risks. We collect the quinto. Revenue to the Crown: 60,000 to 80,000 florins annually. Advantages: no capital outlay, no administrative burden, guaranteed income regardless of operational difficulties. Disadvantages: we surrender eighty percent of the wealth beneath our own mountains.\"\n\n\"Option two: Full Crown operation. We fund everything ourselves—miners, equipment, roads, refineries, security. Revenue to the Crown: 300,000 to 400,000 florins gross, minus operational costs. If costs run to one-third of yield, net revenue perhaps 200,000 to 270,000 florins annually.\" He pauses. \"Advantages: we keep everything. Disadvantages: enormous initial investment, expertise we lack, complex administration vulnerable to corruption, and we bear all risks—cave-ins, depleted veins, labor troubles.\"\n\n\"Option three: Crown-funded contract operation. We own the operation and fund it, but hire experienced mining masters to run extraction. We pay them wages and performance bonuses rather than yield shares. Revenue to the Crown: similar to option two, perhaps slightly less due to higher management costs. Call it 180,000 to 250,000 florins net annually.\" He taps the column. \"Advantages: we retain ownership and bulk of profits while buying expertise. Disadvantages: still requires significant capital outlay, still requires oversight apparatus, and we must find trustworthy contractors.\"\n\nHe sets down the quill and meets your eyes.\n\n\"The difference between option one and options two or three is roughly 150,000 to 200,000 florins per year, Your Majesty. That is transformative. That is the navy, the army, the crusade.\" He pauses. \"But it requires the Crown to become a mining operator, with all the complexities that entails.\"\n\nHe glances at Lucia, then back to you.\n\n\"What is Your Majesty's appetite for complexity?\"",

Let me think about this from a 15th century perspective:\n\nPros:\n- Crown doesn't need to manage day-to-day mining operations\n- Gold fever attracts labor without recruitment costs\n- Miners have strong incentive to be productive (they keep 30%)\n- Crown controls the chokepoint (refineries)\n- Less administrative burden than full Crown operation\n- More revenue than the quinto (70% vs 20%)\n- Infrastructure investment benefits the region long-term\n- Security prevents chaos and theft\n\nCons:\n- Still requires significant capital outlay (roads, refineries, loans)\n- Need to manage the loans\n- Refineries need expertise to operate\n- 30% to miners is very generous compared to typical arrangements\n- Potential for conflict between mining groups\n- Environmental/safety concerns with unregulated mining\n- Ore theft before it reaches refineries\n- Quality control issues\n\nThe 70/30 split is interesting. In medieval mining:\n- The quinto real was 20% to the crown\n- Typical arrangements might give workers far less\n- But here the miners bear more risk and organize themselves\n\nDiego would probably:\n1. Praise the creativity of the approach\n2. Note the chokepoint control via refineries is clever\n3. Question whether 30% is too generous\n4. Raise concerns about ore theft between mine and refinery\n5. Discuss the loan system and its risks\n6. Calculate potential revenues\n\nLet me calculate:\n\nI see potential revenue ranging from 150,000 to 220,000 florins after accounting for infrastructure, security, and loan costs. This innovative model balances risk and reward, offering miners significant motivation while securing substantial returns for the Crown. The approach represents a strategic compromise between direct royal control and complete private enterprise, potentially revolutionizing silver extraction in Granada.\n\nDiego listens intently, his quill moving as he captures the key points. When you finish, he sits back, studying his notes with the expression of a man encountering an unfamiliar but intriguing puzzle.\n\n\"This is... not a model I have seen before, Your Majesty.\" He taps the quill against his chin. \"But it has elegance to it. You have identified the chokepoint.\"\n\nHe draws a quick diagram on his parchment—mountains, a road, a building marked \"refinery.\"\n\n\"The ore is worthless until it is refined. A miner can dig all the silver in the Sierra Nevada, but he cannot sell raw ore in the marketplace. He must bring it to the refinery. And if the Crown owns all the refineries...\"\n\n\"Then the Crown controls the silver,\" Lucia finishes from the window. \"No matter who digs it from the ground.\"\n\n\"Precisely, Your Majesty.\" Diego nods appreciatively. \"The miners bear the risk of finding productive veins, the labor of extraction, the cost of their own tools and supplies. The Crown provides the infrastructure that makes their labor valuable—and takes the lion's share in return.\"\n\nHe begins calculating, muttering figures.\n\n\"Seventy percent to the Crown, thirty to the miners. If total yield is 300,000 florins annually... Crown receives 210,000 florins gross. Operational costs for refineries, roads, security—perhaps 30,000 to 40,000 florins per year once established. Initial capital outlay for construction—\" He pauses, estimating. \"Perhaps 60,000 to 80,000 florins over the first two years for roads, refinery buildings, fortifications, and the loan fund.\"\n\nHe writes the summary:\n\nProjected Annual Revenue (at maturity):\n\nGross Crown share (70%): 210,000 - 280,000 florins\n\nOperating costs: 30,000 - 40,000 florins\n\nNet to Treasury: 180,000 - 240,000 florins\n\nInitial Investment:\n\n60,000 - 80,000 florins over two years\n\n\"The return is extraordinary, Your Majesty. Even at the conservative estimate, we recover our initial investment within six months of full operation, and thereafter...\" He shakes his head slowly. \"Thereafter, we have a river of silver flowing into Toledo every year.\"\n\nHe sets down his quill and folds his hands, his expression shifting to something more cautious.\n\n\"But there are considerations. May I speak frankly?\"\n\nAt your nod, he continues:\n\n\"First—the thirty percent. Your Majesty calls it generous, and it is. A laborer in Castile earns perhaps 15 to 20 florins in a year of hard work. A miner who extracts ore yielding 100 florins in silver takes home 30 florins. If he is part of a group of ten men working a productive vein, they might collectively yield 1,000 florins monthly—300 florins to split among them, 30 florins each per month.\" Diego raises an eyebrow. \"That is wealth beyond dreaming for a common man. You will have no shortage of miners. They will come from across Castile, from Aragon, from Portugal. They will come from France and Germany.\"\n\n\"Is that a problem?\" you ask.\n\n\"It could be. Gold fever—silver fever—brings desperate men, ambitious men, violent men. Your security forces will need to maintain order among thousands of fortune-seekers, many of whom will not find the riches they hoped for.\" He pauses. \"I recommend we establish clear rules from the beginning. Registration of mining groups. Defined claim areas. A tribunal to settle disputes. And harsh penalties for theft and violence.\"\n\n\"What else?\"\n\n\"The loans concern me, Your Majesty. You propose to provide loans for starting miners. This is kind, but it creates a relationship—the Crown as creditor, the miners as debtors. If a man borrows 50 florins to buy tools and supplies, then finds only barren rock, he cannot repay. Do we forgive the debt? Pursue him? Imprison him?\" Diego shrugs. \"I would suggest an alternative. Rather than loans, provide equipment rental. The Crown owns the tools and leases them to mining groups for a small weekly fee. If a group fails, they return the tools and owe nothing. If they succeed, the rental fees are trivial compared to their earnings. We avoid the moral complexity of debt collection.\"\n\nLucia speaks up from the window. \"And the ore itself? Between the mine and the refinery, there is a road. Roads are where things disappear.\"\n\nDiego nods gravely. \"The Queen raises the critical point. A miner who hauls his ore to the refinery receives thirty percent of its value after it is weighed and assayed. But what if he sells a portion to a smuggler before he arrives? What if he claims his cart held less than it did? The Crown's seventy percent depends entirely on honest accounting at the refinery gates.\"\n\nHe considers for a moment.\n\n\"I recommend a system of seals and tallies. When ore is extracted, a Crown inspector at the mine site estimates the weight and seals the cart. When it arrives at the refinery, the seal is checked and the ore weighed again. Significant discrepancies trigger investigation. It will not prevent all theft, but it will discourage casual pilfering.\"\n\nHe gathers his notes and looks at you directly.\n\n\"These are refinements, Your Majesty, not objections. The core of your proposal is sound—perhaps brilliant. You harness the greed of men to do the hard labor while the Crown controls the bottleneck. The thirty percent is high enough to attract workers, but seventy percent of a fortune is still a fortune.\"\n\nHe permits himself a rare small smile.\n\n\"If I may say so, Your Majesty has a merchant's instinct. Your grandfather would be proud.\"",

We put harsh penalties on tax evasion, but would that even be worth it? They would be smuggling ore away and then they would have to refine it somewhere.

The answer is not straightforward.\"\n\nHe pulls out a fresh sheet of parchment and begins sketching figures.\n\n\"There are three paths for the silver. Each has advantages and risks.\"\n\n\"First: Keep it as bullion.\n\n\"We refine the ore into silver bars, stamp them with the royal seal, and store them in the treasury. Bullion is universally valued—it can pay Genoese bankers, German mercenaries, Venetian shipwrights. It crosses borders without question. It does not depend on anyone accepting our coins as legitimate.\"\n\nHe taps the parchment.\n\n\"The disadvantage: bullion sitting in a vault does not circulate. It does not stimulate trade, does not pay wages, does not flow through markets enriching merchants who then pay taxes. It is potential wealth, not active wealth.\"\n\n\"Second: Mint coins for circulation.\n\n\"We establish a mint—Granada would be the logical location, near the source—and strike coins for use in the realm. Silver reales, perhaps, or a new denomination entirely. This puts the wealth into the hands of your subjects. Soldiers spend their pay at taverns. Tavern-keepers buy grain from farmers. Farmers buy tools from smiths. Each transaction generates economic activity and, eventually, tax revenue.\"\n\nDiego's expression turns cautious.\n\n\"But there are dangers. If we flood the markets with new silver coins, we risk inflation—too much money chasing too few goods. Prices rise. A loaf of bread that cost one maravedí costs two. The people blame the Crown, not understanding the cause. The very wealth that should strengthen us breeds resentment.\"\n\nHe draws a small diagram showing coins flowing outward, prices rising.\n\n\"There is also the matter of confidence. New coins must be trusted. Merchants will weigh them, bite them, test them against established currency. If we mint poorly—inconsistent weight, impure alloy—our coins will be discounted in trade. We must establish a reputation for quality, which takes time.\"\n\n\"Third: A balanced approach.\n\n\"We mint some coins for domestic circulation—enough to stimulate trade, pay soldiers, fund projects—but keep a substantial reserve as bullion for international dealings. We control the flow carefully, releasing more silver into circulation as the economy grows to absorb it.\"\n\nDiego sets down his quill and folds his hands.\n\n\"This is the path I would recommend, Your Majesty. But it requires discipline. The temptation to mint more, spend more, will be constant. Every counselor with a project, every general with a campaign, will know that silver sits in the vault. They will argue for its release. The King must be the dam that controls the flood.\"\n\nHe pauses, considering another angle.\n\n\"There is one more consideration. Your Majesty rules multiple territories, each with its own coinage traditions. Castile uses maravedíes and reales. Aragon has its own system. Naples another. Constantinople yet another.\"\n\nHis eyes meet yours.\n\n\"A new silver coin—minted in Granada, bearing your image, standardized in weight and purity—could become the common currency of your empire. Not replacing local coins, but supplementing them. A coin that is accepted from Toledo to Naples to Constantinople because men trust its silver content.\"\n\nHe allows himself a small smile.\n\n\"The Romans did this with the denarius. It bound their empire together as surely as their roads and legions. A single coin that said: this is Rome's promise, and Rome keeps its promises.\"\n\nHe gestures at the map on the wall, showing Juan's scattered territories.\n\n\"What would Your Majesty call such a coin? What image would it bear?\"",

When we say \"florins\" in the treasury, this is likely a unit of account that could represent various actual coins.\n\nIn reality, most medieval treasuries held a mix of:\n- Actual gold coins (relatively rare and valuable)\n- Silver coins (more common)\n- Foreign currency\n- Bullion (bars of gold or silver)\n- Sometimes even goods or credits\n\nFor a kingdom like Castile in the 1430s, the treasury would likely be:\n- Primarily silver-based (the real was the workhorse currency)\n- Some gold (doblas, foreign gold coins)\n- Various foreign currencies from trade\n\nI should have Diego explain the composition and also explain that \"florins\" is often used as a unit of account rather than literal Florentine florins.\n\nLet me think about reasonable proportions:\n- Perhaps 15-25% actual gold\n- 60-70% silver\n- The rest in various forms (foreign currency, bullion, etc.)\n\nThis would be historically reasonable for a Castilian treasury of this period.\n\nDiego pauses, a flicker of something like embarrassment crossing his face.\n\n\"Your Majesty touches on a matter of some... complexity.\" He pulls out a different ledger from his stack—older, more worn, filled with cramped notations. \"When we speak of 'florins,' we speak of a unit of account. A convenient fiction for comparing values. The actual treasury holds...\"\n\nHe runs his finger down columns of figures, muttering calculations.\n\n\"The physical contents of the royal treasury, as of the last audit in March of this year:\"\n\nHe begins writing a summary:\n\nRoyal Treasury Holdings - March 1438\n\nGold Coinage:\n\nDoblas castellanas: approximately 42,000 coins (value: ~84,000 florins equivalent)\n\nFlorentine florins (actual): approximately 8,500 coins (value: ~8,500 florins)\n\nVenetian ducats: approximately 3,200 coins (value: ~3,400 florins)\n\nVarious other gold (Aragonese, Navarrese, French): ~6,000 florins equivalent\n\nTotal gold: approximately 102,000 florins equivalent\n\nSilver Coinage:\n\nReales castellanos: approximately 1.8 million coins (value: ~180,000 florins equivalent)\n\nAragonese silver: ~45,000 florins equivalent\n\nNeapolitan silver: ~38,000 florins equivalent\n\nVarious foreign silver: ~22,000 florins equivalent\n\nTotal silver: approximately 285,000 florins equivalent\n\nBullion:\n\nGold bars (sealed, assayed): ~35,000 florins equivalent\n\nSilver bars: ~78,000 florins equivalent\n\nTotal bullion: approximately 113,000 florins equivalent\n\nOther Holdings:\n\nLetters of credit (Medici bank, Genoese houses): ~180,000 florins\n\nDebts owed to Crown (collectible): ~95,000 florins\n\nGoods and materials (stored grain, military supplies, etc.): ~85,000 florins equivalent\n\nTotal other: approximately 360,000 florins equivalent\n\nDiego looks up from his figures.\n\n\"So when we say 'one million florins,' we mean roughly 100,000 in gold coin, 285,000 in silver coin, 113,000 in bullion, and the remainder in credits, debts owed, and physical goods.\" He taps the parchment. \"Only about 500,000 florins could be loaded onto a cart and carried away. The rest is... promises. Good promises, from reliable parties, but promises nonetheless.\"\n\nHe leans back.\n\n\"This is why the Granada silver is so significant, Your Majesty. It is not promises. It is not letters of credit that depend on a Florentine banker's goodwill. It is metal—real, physical wealth that we control entirely.\"\n\nHe hesitates, then adds:\n\n\"It also explains why a new currency would be... transformative. Right now, our silver coinage is predominantly reales—good coins, trusted in Castile, but they bear the marks of previous kings, previous mints, inconsistent weights. A new coin, struck from Granada silver, standardized and pure, bearing Your Majesty's image...\"\n\nDiego's voice drops, almost reverent.\n\n\"It would announce to the world that Castile is no longer scraping by on inherited wealth. It would say: we have our own silver. We mint our own future.\"\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\"What would Your Majesty wish to call such a coin?\"",

I need to consider:\n\nPositive factors:\n- Juan's reputation as a powerful, stable monarch\n- The promise of a major new silver operation\n- Good wages likely available\n- Spain is relatively safe compared to war-torn areas\n- The 70/30 split means the Crown is serious about this operation\n\nNegative factors:\n- Existing silver operations (Saxony, Bohemia) may not want to lose their experts\n- Distance from traditional mining centers in Central Europe\n- Spanish reputation - Moors recently conquered, unknown territory for German/Bohemian miners\n- Competition from other employers\n- Language barriers\n- Religious considerations (Spain's crusading reputation)\n\nSources of experts:\n- Saxony (major silver mining region)\n- Bohemia (also significant)\n- The Harz mountains\n- Tyrol\n- Perhaps some Italian expertise (Genoese, Venetian)\n\nLet me draft a balanced table.\n\nDiego nods approvingly at the methodical approach.\n\n\"The fortifications and roads first—yes. Without security, we invite disaster. Without roads, we cannot move ore or supplies.\" He makes notes. \"I will coordinate with Don García and the royal engineers. We should budget 40,000 florins for the first year of construction, with another 30,000 in the second year for completion and refinements.\"\n\nHe pauses at the mention of refineries.\n\n\"This is where we face a challenge, Your Majesty. Silver refining—cupellation, the separation of silver from lead and other impurities—is a specialized art. The great masters of this craft work in Saxony, Bohemia, the Harz mountains, and Tyrol. They guard their secrets jealously, and their current employers guard them jealously.\"\n\nHe pulls out a fresh sheet.\n\n\"We must convince such men to travel to Granada, share their expertise, and train local workers. This will require generous compensation, comfortable conditions, and assurances of safety and respect. Some may come for gold. Others may come for adventure. Others still may be fleeing troubles at home.\"\n\nAttracting Foreign Refining Experts\n\nContext: The Crown seeks master refiners to establish and operate the Granada silver refineries. The primary sources of such expertise are the German-speaking mining regions—Saxony, Bohemia, Tyrol, and the Harz. These men are valuable, and their current employers will not release them willingly.\n\nPositive Factors:\n\nJuan's reputation as a wealthy, stable, and ambitious monarch\n\nGenerous compensation can be offered\n\nA new operation offers opportunities for advancement unavailable in established mines\n\nSpain's climate is gentler than the German mountains\n\nThe scale of the discovery is attractive—men want to be part of something historic\n\nGenoese connections may provide introductions\n\nNegative Factors:\n\nDistance from Central Europe—a long journey for families\n\nLanguage and cultural barriers\n\nSpanish reputation among Germans is limited—an unknown land\n\nExisting employers may actively obstruct recruitment\n\nReligious considerations—the Inquisition's reputation precedes it\n\nSkilled masters are few and in high demand everywhere\n\nRoll\nResult\n1-5\nFailure. Word spreads poorly, or competitors actively sabotage recruitment. No masters of quality agree to come. We must make do with second-rate practitioners or delay the refineries significantly.\n6-15\nDisappointing. Only one or two minor experts agree to travel—journeymen rather than masters, capable but not exceptional. The refineries can operate, but inefficiently. Yields will be lower than hoped until local expertise develops.\n16-30\nModest Success. A small team of competent refiners—perhaps three or four men with solid experience—agrees to come. They can establish basic operations and train local workers, but the refineries will take longer to reach full efficiency.\n31-50\nAdequate. A proper team arrives: one recognized master and four or five experienced journeymen. They bring knowledge, tools, and techniques sufficient to establish quality operations. Training of local workers can begin immediately.\n51-70\nGood Result. We attract a respected master from Saxony or Bohemia, along with a full team of skilled workers. They bring not only expertise but connections—other specialists may follow once word spreads of good conditions. The refineries will operate at high efficiency from the start.\n71-85\nExcellent. A renowned master—one whose name is known throughout the mining regions—agrees to come, bringing his best journeymen. He sees Granada as his legacy, a chance to build something greater than maintaining old operations. He also brings innovations that could improve yields beyond standard expectations.\n86-95\nExceptional. Multiple masters compete for the opportunity. We can select the best, and their rivalry drives them to excel. They bring cutting-edge techniques from different traditions—Saxon, Bohemian, Tyrolean—which can be combined. The Granada refineries may become the most advanced in Christendom.\n96-100\nTransformative. A legendary figure of the refining world—perhaps fleeing political troubles, perhaps seeking one final great project before retirement—offers his services. He brings not just expertise but a complete operational system: techniques, tools, training methods, and quality controls developed over a lifetime. The Granada operation becomes a model others will study for generations.\n\nRoll when ready.",

The message is simple: The Crown of Castile seeks masters of the refining art. Compensation beyond measure. Opportunity beyond imagining.\n\nWeeks pass. The fortifications at Lanteira begin to rise. Roads are surveyed. And then, in late autumn, a reply arrives from an unexpected quarter.\n\nDiego brings you the letter himself, his face betraying unusual excitement.\n\n\"It comes from Freiberg, Your Majesty.

I say this not from pride but so Your Majesty understands what I offer.\n\nI am fifty-three years old. My wife is dead. My sons work in mines I have made great, but they will never surpass what I have already built. I had thought to die in Saxony, having done all I could do.\n\nThen I heard of Granada.\n\nA virgin district. Silver veins untouched by human hands.

The man is genuine. The Freiberg mines are among the richest in Europe, and von Steinberg's name is known throughout the German lands. The pattinson process his journeymen have mastered is a recent innovation—it produces silver of exceptional purity, highly prized by mints.\" He pauses. \"His terms are... not unreasonable.

And I will include a letter of credit for his travel expenses—we want him to arrive with his full company, not leave half of them behind for lack of funds.\"\n\nHe gathers his papers, already composing the response in his head.\n\nThe Granada Silver Operation: 1438\n\nContext: The Crown is establishing a major silver mining operation in the Sierra Nevada near Lanteira. Security forces are in place (1,000 men under a Crown Marshall), fortifications are under construction, and roads are being surveyed. Heinrich von Steinberg and his team of experts will arrive by summer. The 70/30 split has been determined, and the call for miners will go out once the refinery can receive ore.\n\nPlanned Activities:\n\nComplete fortifications at key access points\n\nBuild roads capable of bearing ore carts from mines to refinery\n\nConstruct refinery facilities under von Steinberg's direction\n\nEstablish administrative apparatus (registration, dispute tribunal, inspectors)\n\nSend out call for miners once infrastructure is ready\n\nBegin initial extraction and refining operations\n\nBudget Allocated:\n\n40,000 florins for Year One (roads, fortifications, refinery construction)\n\nAdditional funds for von Steinberg's salary and team\n\nEquipment rental stock for mining groups\n\nPositive Factors:\n\nExcellent master refiner recruited with full team\n\nStrong security presence from the start\n\nCompetent governor (Don García) overseeing local operations\n\nClear rules established before operations begin\n\nGenerous miner share will attract eager workers\n\nDiego de Daza's methodical financial oversight\n\nCrown has sufficient capital reserves\n\nNegative Factors:\n\nMountain terrain complicates road construction\n\nvon Steinberg must travel from Saxony (delays possible)\n\nLocal workforce entirely untrained in silver mining\n\nSierra Nevada weather can be harsh and unpredictable\n\nFirst year of any operation reveals unforeseen problems\n\nSilver fever may attract troublemakers alongside honest workers\n\nDistance from Toledo complicates oversight\n\nRoll\nResult\n1-5\nDisaster. Something goes catastrophically wrong—a collapse kills workers, von Steinberg's party is lost en route, a fire destroys the half-built refinery, or a violent incident sparks unrest. The operation is set back by a year or more. Significant financial losses.\n6-15\nSerious Setbacks. Multiple problems compound: roads wash out in autumn rains, von Steinberg arrives late with only half his team, construction costs overrun significantly, and early miners find less ore than hoped. The operation will function, but 1439 revenues will be a fraction of projections.\n16-25\nTroubled Start. One major problem and several minor ones. Perhaps the refinery construction is delayed, or the first mining groups clash violently over claims, or a key road section proves nearly impossible to build. The operation proceeds, but behind schedule and over budget.\n26-40\nDifficult but Manageable. The expected challenges of a new operation—weather delays, supply problems, labor disputes, higher costs than projected. Nothing catastrophic, but nothing goes smoothly either. By year's end, the refinery is operational but not yet at capacity. Initial revenues are modest.\n41-55\nAdequate Progress. The operation unfolds roughly as planned. Roads are completed on schedule, the refinery is built, von Steinberg proves competent, miners arrive in reasonable numbers. Some problems arise but are resolved. By year's end, silver begins flowing—not yet at full capacity, but promising.\n56-70\nSolid Success. Everything comes together well. Von Steinberg proves as skilled as his reputation suggested, the roads are completed ahead of schedule, and the first miners extract ore of excellent quality. Initial refining produces encouraging yields. The operation will reach full capacity by mid-1439.\n71-85\nExcellent Results. The operation exceeds expectations. Von Steinberg's innovations improve efficiency beyond projections, the ore quality is even richer than the Genoese estimated, and the 30% share attracts skilled miners from across Iberia. By year's end, significant silver is already flowing to Toledo. 1439 revenues may exceed initial projections.\n86-95\nExceptional Achievement. A model operation from the start. Von Steinberg declares the ore the finest he has seen in thirty years. His pattinson process produces silver of extraordinary purity. Miners arrive in such numbers that a second refinery is already being planned. The Crown's share in 1438 alone approaches 50,000 florins—and this is merely the beginning.\n96-100\nBeyond All Expectation. The Lanteira district proves even richer than anyone imagined—the Genoese assessments were conservative. Von Steinberg discovers the veins extend further than mapped, with ore quality that rivals legend. Word spreads across Christendom: Spain has become a land of silver. Miners, merchants, craftsmen flock to Granada. The 1438 yield alone funds a significant portion of the imperial budget, and projections for future years must be revised dramatically upward.\n\nRoll when ready.",

      "text": "This should feel like a natural continuation of the story, with specific details and perhaps some dialogue from von Steinberg to bring it to life.\n\nThe year unfolds like a prayer answered.\n\nSpring 1438\n\nVon Steinberg's party crosses the Pyrenees in late April—thirteen Germans, their wagons laden with tools, instruments, and crates of books. Don García meets them personally at the Granada city gates and escorts them to Lanteira.\n\nThe Saxon master stands at the edge of the ravine where the Moorish shepherd first found the strange stones. He is a weathered man, grey-bearded, with hands scarred by decades of working with molten metal. He says nothing for a long time, simply studying the exposed rock faces, the color of the soil, the way the light catches certain outcroppings.\n\nThen he kneels, picks up a chunk of ore, and examines it with a jeweler's loupe he produces from his coat.\n\n\"Mein Gott,\" he whispers.\n\nHe looks up at Don García, then at the Crown Marshall, then at the mountains rising around them.\n\n\"In thirty-one years,\" he says, his Latin thick with a Saxon accent, \"I have never seen ore like this. The Freiberg veins are rich—the richest in Saxony. This...\" He holds up the chunk of rock. \"This is finer. Purer. The silver content per ton will exceed anything in the German lands.\"\n\nHe stands, brushing dust from his knees, and his weathered face breaks into a smile that makes him look twenty years younger.\n\n\"We will build something magnificent here.\"\n\nSummer 1438\n\nThe roads are completed by July—a feat of engineering that owes much to the army of laborers Don García has recruited from Granada's population. Good wages for honest work, the governor promised, and men who might otherwise have turned to banditry instead turned to pick and shovel.\n\nVon Steinberg designs the refinery himself, rejecting several proposed sites before finding one that satisfies his exacting requirements: proper drainage, access to water for the washing processes, elevation for ventilation, and defensible approaches.\n\n\"A refinery is not just a building,\" he lectures his Spanish apprentices. \"It is a system. Air must flow. Water must drain. Heat must be controlled. Get any one element wrong, and men die.\"\n\nThe construction crews work through the summer heat, and by August, the first furnaces are being installed.\n\nMeanwhile, the call goes out: Silver in Granada. Thirty percent to every man who digs it.\n\nThey come.\n\nFirst in trickles—adventurous men from Andalusia, younger sons with nothing to inherit, veterans of the Granada war who know the mountains. Then in streams—Castilians, Aragonese, Portuguese crossing the border despite no formal summons. By September, over two thousand men have registered with the Crown's administrators, forming themselves into mining groups of ten to thirty, staking claims in the designated areas.\n\nThe tribunal Don García establishes—three judges rotating monthly—settles fourteen disputes in its first week. By the end of the month, the number has dropped to two or three. Men learn quickly that the Crown's rules are fair but firm.\n\nAutumn 1438\n\nThe first ore carts arrive at the refinery in early October. Von Steinberg's journeymen—the two who have mastered the pattinson process—oversee the initial refining personally.\n\nThe results exceed even the Saxon master's expectations.\n\n\"The German ore requires three passes through the cupellation process,\" von Steinberg explains to the Crown inspector Diego has sent to observe. \"This ore requires only two. The silver separates more cleanly. The purity...\" He shows the inspector an ingot, freshly cast, gleaming in the autumn light. \"Ninety-seven parts in a hundred. I have seen ninety-seven perhaps twice in my career. Here, it is the standard.\"\n\nBy November, the refinery is operating at full capacity—and it is not enough. Ore carts queue at the gates, waiting their turn. Miners grumble at the delays.\n\nVon Steinberg sends a letter to Toledo:\n\nYour Majesty,\n\nWe require a second refinery. The current facility cannot process the volume of ore being extracted. I recommend construction begin immediately, to be operational by spring 1439. I have identified a suitable site two leagues north of the current facility.\n\nAdditionally, I request permission to send for more journeymen from Saxony. The local workers are learning quickly—they are not stupid, merely untrained—but we need experienced men to oversee the expanded operations.\n\nThe ore quality continues to astonish. I have revised my estimates upward. If production continues at current rates, the Crown's share for 1438 alone will approach 50,000 florins. By 1440, with two refineries operating, I project 250,000 to 300,000 florins annually.\n\nI did not believe such numbers were possible when I left Freiberg. I was wrong.\n\nYour servant,\nHeinrich von Steinberg\n\nYear's End 1438\n\nDiego de Daza presents the preliminary accounts in December, his face struggling to maintain its customary reserve.\n\n\"The Granada silver operation, Your Majesty. First quarter of production—October through December.\"\n\nHe lays out the figures:\n\nGranada Silver Operation - Q4 1438\n\nOre Processed: 847 tons\n\nSilver Yield: 12,340 marks (approximately 2,838 kg)\n\nTotal Value: 74,040 florins\n\nCrown Share (70%): 51,828 florins\n\nMiner Share (30%): 22,212 florins (distributed among registered groups)\n\nOperating Costs: 8,400 florins (refinery operations, security, administration)\n\nNet Revenue to Treasury: 43,428 florins\n\nDiego sets down the parchment.\n\n\"Forty-three thousand florins, Your Majesty. In three months. From a single refinery operating at capacity for only the final six weeks of the year.\"\n\nHe pulls out another sheet—projections.\n\n\"Von Steinberg's estimates for 1439, assuming the second refinery is completed by summer:\n\nFull-year production: 180,000 to 220,000 florins net to Treasury\n\n1440 and beyond (two refineries at full capacity): 250,000 to 300,000 florins annually\n\n\"These numbers assume no new discoveries. If additional veins are found—and von Steinberg believes they will be—the figures could go higher.\"\n\nLucia, sitting by the window with Juana on her lap, speaks quietly.\n\n\"You said our total revenues across all territories were perhaps 1.2 million florins in a good year.\"\n\n\"Yes, Your Majesty.\"\n\n\"And by 1440, Granada alone could add another 250,000 to 300,000.\"\n\n\"Yes, Your Majesty.\"\n\nShe looks at you, grey-green eyes bright.\n\n\"That is a twenty to twenty-five percent increase in Crown revenues. From a single mountain district.\"\n\nDiego nods slowly.\n\n\"The House of Trastámara,\" he says, \"has become one of the wealthiest in Christendom. And the mines have only just begun to produce.\"",

Ambitious projections indicate potential annual revenues reaching 250,000-300,000 florins by 1440, signaling massive economic potential\n\n.\n\nKey characters span military, noble, and local social strata, including prominent figures like Don Álvaro de Luna and regional leaders from Ávila and Toledo.\n\nPerformance rolls reveal fascinating dynamics: exceptional riding skills among youth, particularly Pedro's hidden talent, contrasted with Lucía's initial overwhelm. Critical rolls highlight realm stability, silver discoveries, and promising mining operations, suggesting transformative economic opportunities emerging through strategic expertise recruitment.\n\nThe document was created successfully.
