The May sun warms the stone facades, and the people who days ago might have hurled stones now press forward to catch a glimpse of the returned pontiff. Florentine lancers in their red-and-gold livery form a cordon ahead, while behind you ride the sixty-seven Vatican Guards who chose Florence over desertion—men seeking to reclaim their honor through service.\n\nTommaso Parentucelli rides a few paces back, his saddlebags heavy with the reform documents preserved through the flight. Fray Hernando is there too, his face drawn from the weeks of exile but his eyes bright with gratitude. Your own Caballeros del Defensor maintain their disciplined formation, Rodrigo de Mendoza at their head, the white banner with its golden cross catching the breeze.\n\nEugenius leans toward you, his voice low beneath the cheering. The papal tiara sits heavy on his brow, but his eyes hold a warmth that transcends formality. He has already agreed to the Swiss Guard, confirmed Alfonso's Naples investiture, and promised support against the Ottomans.\n\n\"What else, old friend?\" the Pope asks again, his tone almost conspiratorial. \"You have restored my city, gathered evidence that may yet expose the rot in my own household, and asked for nothing but what serves Christendom. Surely there is something you desire for yourself? For Castile? I am not so old that I cannot recognize when a man restrains his tongue.\"\n\nThe procession slows as you approach the steps of St. Peter's, where Cardinal-deacons wait with holy water and incense. You have perhaps a minute before ceremony demands your attention.",

The question is: how has Basel reacted to the Pope's parallel legislation approach and the reforms? Have the radicals been neutralized or have they found new grounds for conflict?\n\nFactors to consider:\n- POSITIVE: Pope passed reforms (removes main grievance), Hussites reconciled, Rochetaillée converted, crusade providing common cause\n- NEGATIVE: D'Allemand wants papal subordination not just reform, radicals see parallel legislation as papal attempt to claim credit, the constitutional question (council supremacy) remains unresolved\n\nI'll develop a nuanced chaos roll mechanism to capture the complex political dynamics at Basel. The table will map out potential scenarios ranging from reconciliation to potential schism, weighing the delicate balance between reformist progress and radical ambitions.\n\nNow I have a comprehensive understanding of the Basel situation. Let me draft a chaos roll for you.\n\nCHAOS ROLL: STATE OF THE COUNCIL OF BASEL\n\nEarly May 1435\n\nContext:\n\nThe Council of Basel has been in session for nearly four years. In our alternate timeline, significant developments have changed the dynamic:\n\nFactors Favoring Stability:\n\nPope Eugenius passed the major reform decrees (pluralism, concubinage, annates) as parallel legislation via motu proprio (March 1434)\n\nThe Compacts of Basel ended the Hussite Wars (November 1433)\n\nCardinal Rochetaillée's conversion (Roll 99) created a bridge between radicals and moderates\n\nThe Constantinople crusade provides a unifying cause\n\nDeclaration of Como established framework for cooperation between secular powers and Church authorities\n\nEmperor Sigismund supports the parallel legislation approach\n\nFactors Favoring Conflict:\n\nCardinal Louis d'Allemand of Arles leads a committed radical faction (60-80 members) who want constitutional change, not just reform\n\nParallel legislation sidesteps the core question: Who holds supreme authority?\n\nThe radicals' goal was never just reform—it was establishing council supremacy over the papacy\n\nModerate members drift home over time, strengthening radical proportion\n\nPope's Camera reform threatens interests of those who benefited from corruption\n\nPope fled Rome April 1435—radicals may see this as weakness or opportunity\n\nWhat We're Rolling For:\n\nHow has the Council of Basel evolved since the parallel legislation? Have the radicals been marginalized, or have they found new ground to attack the Pope?\n\nD100 CHAOS TABLE: BASEL IN MAY 1435\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-5\nCOUNCIL DECLARES EUGENIUS CONTUMACIOUS — The radicals have moved aggressively. Citing the Pope's Rome crisis as evidence of divine disfavor, d'Allemand pushed through a formal summons requiring Eugenius to appear before the Council within 60 days to answer charges. This is the first step toward deposition. Cesarini barely held the line against worse. The constitutional crisis that parallel legislation avoided has arrived anyway.\n6-15\nRADICAL ASCENDANCY — D'Allemand's faction has grown stronger as moderates leave Basel. The Council passed Session 21 abolishing annates entirely (not the reduced version)—rejecting the papal parallel decree. They're claiming the Pope's version was an attempt to \"steal credit\" for reform while preserving papal revenue. Cesarini is losing control. The Council is preparing to negotiate with Constantinople independently, bypassing papal authority.\n16-25\nSTALEMATE WITH TENSION — The Council accepted the reforms but refuses to acknowledge papal authority to pass them. A formal declaration states that the Basel decrees are the source of reform, and papal endorsement is merely \"appropriate acknowledgment.\" D'Allemand pushes for more but lacks votes. Cesarini holds the center but is exhausted. Any misstep by Eugenius could tip the balance toward the radicals.\n26-40\nUNEASY COOPERATION — The parallel legislation created grudging acceptance. The Council ratified its own reforms and \"noted with satisfaction\" the papal decrees \"insofar as they accord with conciliar legislation.\" The constitutional question remains studiously unaddressed. D'Allemand grumbles but lacks momentum. The crusade provides distraction. Rochetaillée's bridge-building has isolated the most extreme voices. Functional but fragile.\n41-55\nQUIET TRIUMPH FOR MODERATES — Cesarini has successfully argued that reform matters more than constitutional theory. The Council passed a resolution praising \"the cooperation of Pope and Council in the work of reform\" without addressing supremacy. D'Allemand's faction is down to perhaps 40 committed supporters. Many delegates have gone home satisfied. The Greek union negotiations are proceeding (where to meet remains undecided). The worst has been avoided—for now.\n56-70\nREFORM MOMENTUM — The success of parallel legislation has created appetite for more. The Council is working on new decrees (papal elections, benefice reservations) with the explicit understanding that the Pope will pass matching legislation. Cesarini has established a working channel with Rome through Rochetaillée. D'Allemand's faction is marginalized. The Council may naturally wind down within a year or two as its reform agenda is accomplished.\n71-80\nUNEXPECTED ALIGNMENT — Rochetaillée's conversion created a cascade. Several French bishops followed his lead, recognizing that reform-through-cooperation serves their interests better than constitutional war. The Council sent a formal letter to Eugenius expressing \"filial respect\" while \"humbly requesting\" his presence at a future session to celebrate the reforms together. D'Allemand has perhaps 25 bitter supporters left. The Greek negotiations are proceeding smoothly.\n81-90\nCESARINI'S TRIUMPH — The Cardinal-President has achieved the seemingly impossible: framing parallel legislation as a conciliar victory. His argument—that the Pope passed these reforms because of conciliar pressure—satisfies most delegates while preserving papal dignity. A joint commission is proposed to oversee reform implementation. D'Allemand announced his withdrawal from active participation, citing ill health (political cover for defeat). The constitutional question is being buried under practical cooperation.\n91-95\nRECONCILIATION OVERTURES — The Council has formally invited Pope Eugenius to Basel for a ceremony celebrating Church unity and reform. The invitation acknowledges his \"apostolic solicitude\" while claiming \"conciliar guidance.\" It's ambiguous enough for both sides to accept. D'Allemand voted against it and was outvoted 3-to-1. If Eugenius accepts (carefully), this could mark the effective end of the constitutional crisis. The Greek union council location is being negotiated in good faith with papal involvement.\n96-100\nTHE COUNCIL DECLARES VICTORY AND WINDS DOWN — In an extraordinary development, the Council passed a resolution declaring that \"the great work of reform in head and members\" has been substantially accomplished through \"the harmonious cooperation of the Sacred Council and the Holy Father.\" They've set a terminus of December 1436 for remaining business, after which the Council will formally close. D'Allemand walked out in protest with fewer than 20 followers. Cesarini wept with relief. The threat of schism is fading.\n\nPlease roll d100 to determine the state of the Council of Basel.",

      "text": "The roll of 49 places us firmly in the moderate success range.\n\nWhat Has Happened at Basel (Late 1434 - Early 1435):\n\nCardinal Cesarini has successfully argued that reform matters more than constitutional theory. His relentless message—\"We came here to heal the Church, not to wage war on the Pope\"—has worn down all but the most committed radicals.\n\nThe Council passed a carefully worded resolution in January 1435 praising \"the cooperation of Pope and Council in the work of reform\" without addressing the supremacy question. The phrase was Cesarini's masterstroke: it implies neither submission nor victory, merely partnership in a holy cause.\n\nCardinal d'Allemand's faction has shrunk to perhaps 40 committed supporters—enough to obstruct but not enough to command. Many French delegates went home after the Compacts of Basel ended the Hussite Wars, satisfied that the Council had accomplished something historic. The Germans, never enthusiastic about French-led radicalism, have largely drifted toward the moderate center.\n\nCardinal Rochetaillée's conversion (Roll 99 in Chapter 2.21) proved significant. His public acknowledgment that \"my cause had become about power rather than reform\" gave cover to others who wanted to step back from the brink. Several bishops followed his lead.\n\nThe Greek union negotiations are proceeding—envoys arrived in September 1434 to discuss where the reunion council should be held. This remains undecided (Basel wants it in Basel or Avignon; the Greeks want somewhere in Italy accessible by sea), but the discussions are in good faith. The Pope is involved through his legates.\n\nSession 20 (January 22, 1435) passed decrees against clerical concubinage and abuses of excommunication—reforms the Pope had already endorsed through parallel legislation. Session 21 is being prepared for June, likely addressing benefice reservations.\n\nThe worst has been avoided—for now. The constitutional question remains a sleeping dragon. If Eugenius stumbles badly, d'Allemand could revive it. But the momentum favors continued cooperation.\n\nNews Juan Would Have Received:\n\nA dispatch from Abbot Rodrigo González (still managing the Castilian delegation at Basel) arrived in Rome in late April, carried by the same courier network that brought word of the Pope's flight to Florence. The key points:\n\nCesarini holds the center; the Council is focused on reform, not confrontation\n\nD'Allemand's faction is marginalized but not eliminated\n\nThe Greek negotiations are progressing; location remains the sticking point\n\nRochetaillée's bridge-building has been effective\n\nThe Council has not challenged the papal parallel legislation—a tacit acceptance\n\nMany delegates have gone home; perhaps 300 active members remain (down from 500+ at peak)\n\nThe Castilian delegation remains well-regarded as honest brokers\n\nThe procession continues toward St. Peter's. Eugenius has asked what else Juan desires. The bells ring. The moment passes.\n\nDo you wish to respond to the Pope's question now, or do you have other matters to address first?",

If we send men of moderate temperament—bishops who want reform but not revolution—they dilute d'Allemand's proportion. Every vote we add is a vote he loses. The Council's own rules become its undoing.\"\n\nHe strokes his beard, calculating. \"We must be subtle. Not men known as papal creatures—that would provoke. Men with genuine reform credentials who happen to believe the Pope should remain Pope. Italy has many such. Spain too, I think. If Castile sent another dozen delegates... theologians, canonists, men of learning who would be welcomed by Cesarini...\"\n\nThe procession slows as you approach the Vatican steps. Eugenius has perhaps thirty seconds before ceremony consumes him.\n\n\"As for pending reforms—\" He ticks them on his fingers. \"Benefice reservations. The Council wants to strip Rome's power to reserve benefices for papal appointment. Papal elections—they wish to regulate how conclaves function, who may vote, how long cardinals may deliberate. And the great unfinished matter: where to hold the Greek council. Basel wants Avignon or Basel itself. The Greeks refuse anywhere they cannot reach by ship. Constantinople, perhaps, or somewhere in Italy.\"\n\nHe glances at you. \"The location question may be the rock on which d'Allemand's ambitions finally break. The Greeks will not come to him, and he cannot force them.\"\n\nA cardinal-deacon approaches with holy water. Eugenius lowers his voice to barely a breath.\n\n\"You also left petitions with Us before Constantinople. The Dominican endowment. The Inquisition mandate for Granada. The Military Orders charter. We have not forgotten. Come to Us tomorrow, privately, and We shall address them all.\"\n\nThe ceremony begins.

General matters of reform and the Order's role\n\nLet me search for more context about Juan's previous interactions with Dominicans.\n\nThe papal ceremony will consume hours—the formal reentry, the Mass of thanksgiving, the addresses from Roman clergy.

      "text": "Juan is approaching the Dominican Master General about his vision for religious and social reform in Castile. This is a significant conversation - the Dominicans are the preaching order, founded specifically for this purpose, and they also run the Inquisition.\n\nLet me think about Fra Bartholomew Texier's likely reaction:\n\n1. He's French - this is relevant given the French faction at Basel\n2. He's been Master General since around 1426 - experienced, political\n3. The Dominicans are the Order of Preachers - Juan's request aligns with their core mission\n4. Juan is offering money/endowment (the Dominican endowment petition mentioned to the Pope)\n5. Juan is essentially asking for a massive expansion of Dominican activity in Castile\n\nTexier would be:\n- Interested - this is what Dominicans do\n- Cautious - kings always have ulterior motives\n- Practical - what resources, what authority, what independence?\n- Politically aware - Juan is rising in influence, allied with Pope, has restored Rome\n\nThe request is actually quite reasonable and aligned with Dominican purpose. But Texier would want to know:\n- What level of control does Juan expect?\n- What funding?\n- What about the Inquisition (Juan mentioned an Inquisition mandate for Granada)?\n- What independence will the friars have?\n\nI should have Texier respond thoughtfully, ask probing questions, and not immediately agree or disagree. He's a savvy operator who has run a global religious order for nearly a decade.\n\nAlso, Juan's language is getting a bit messianic again - \"kingdom of heaven,\" \"God's image\" - Texier might notice this. But he's also a preacher, so he understands passionate religious language.\n\nLet me write a response that shows Texier as:\n- Genuinely interested\n- Asking practical questions\n- Slightly wary of the grandiosity\n- But ultimately open to discussion\n\nFra Bartholomew listens without interruption, his fingers steepled beneath his chin. When you finish, he remains silent for a long moment—the silence of a man who has heard many kings speak of God's purposes and learned to distinguish genuine piety from gilded ambition.\n\n\"The kingdom of heaven,\" he repeats softly. \"You speak like a friar, Your Majesty. Or perhaps like a crusader who has seen too much of the world's darkness and yearns for light.\"\n\nHe rises and moves to the window, looking out over the cloister where Dominican novices walk in quiet contemplation.\n\n\"What you describe—priests for the poor, hospitals, food for the hungry, preaching to strengthen families in faith—this is the very mission Saint Dominic founded our Order to fulfill. We are the Ordo Praedicatorum. We exist to preach, to teach, to bring souls to God.\" He turns back to you. \"So yes, Your Majesty, what you ask aligns with our purpose.\"\n\n\"But.\"\n\nThe word hangs in the air.\n\n\"Kings who speak of God's kingdom often mean their own kingdom dressed in vestments. I do not say this is true of you—I say only that I must ask questions a Master General must ask.\"\n\nHe returns to his chair, leaning forward.\n\n\"First: What independence would my friars have? A Dominican answers to his prior, his provincial, and ultimately to me and to the Holy Father. Not to kings. We preach truth as the Church defines it, even when that truth is inconvenient to thrones. Can you accept friars in your kingdom who may one day tell you that you have sinned?\"\n\nHis eyes hold yours.\n\n\"Second: You speak of Granada. The Inquisition mandate you have petitioned for—I know of it. The Dominicans have long served as inquisitors. But inquisition is a blade that cuts carefully or not at all. What do you envision for the converts of Granada? Instruction in faith? Or interrogation of doubt?\"\n\n\"Third: Funding. Hospitals, food programs, priests for poor parishes—these require gold, and gold given creates obligation. What do you offer, and what do you expect in return?\"\n\nHe spreads his hands.\n\n\"Speak plainly, Your Majesty. I am too old for courtly dancing. If your vision is truly holy, plainness will only make it shine brighter.\"\n\nHow does Juan respond?",

Independence - Juan says he won't interfere with the friars' mission, they are loyal to the Church not to him, and if he sins, they can tell him.\n\n2. Granada converts - Juan wants the Dominicans to protect genuine converts from those who convert falsely, essentially distinguishing sincere Christians from those who convert for benefits but don't truly believe.\n\n3. Funding - Juan says it's a gift with no strings attached, his reward is a stronger kingdom and more worship of God.\n\nJuan also mentions he wants to discuss this with Fra Bartholomew before proposing things in Castile.\n\nThis is a significant conversation. Fra Bartholomew is a cautious, experienced leader who has dealt with many rulers. He'll appreciate Juan's directness but will still probe.\n\nThe responses are reasonable and humble - Juan accepts that friars can criticize him, he frames the Inquisition as protecting genuine converts (which is a nuanced position), and he claims no strings on the gold.\n\nFra Bartholomew would be cautiously impressed but might still have concerns or questions. He might want to know specifics - how much gold, how many friars, what areas, what oversight structure?\n\nI should have Fra Bartholomew respond thoughtfully - perhaps warming to Juan but still being practical about implementation. He's French, has governed the Order for nearly a decade, and is politically astute.\n\nLet me write a response where Fra Bartholomew:\n1. Acknowledges Juan's good answers\n2. Perhaps asks some practical follow-up questions\n3. Shows growing interest but maintains his careful demeanor\n4. Maybe mentions what the Order can actually provide\n\nI shouldn't make him agree too easily - he's a careful man. But Juan's answers were good and humble, so he should warm somewhat.\n\nFra Bartholomew's expression shifts subtly—the guarded assessment giving way to something approaching genuine interest. He picks up a quill, turns it absently in his fingers, then sets it down.\n\n\"You answer well, Your Majesty. Better than most who sit in that chair.\"\n\nHe rises and pours two cups of wine, handing one to you directly rather than letting a servant do it—a gesture of respect between equals in conversation, if not in rank.\n\n\"The independence of the Order is not negotiable, and you have not tried to negotiate it. That alone distinguishes you from... others.\" A flicker of something—old frustrations with other monarchs, perhaps—crosses his face. \"And your framing of the Inquisition mandate is sound. The purpose is not persecution but discernment. To protect the sincere from being tarred by the false. To give genuine converts the honor they deserve for their sacrifice, while ensuring the sacraments are not profaned by those who mouth words they do not believe.\"\n\nHe returns to his seat, cradling the wine.\n\n\"As for the gold being a gift—\" A thin smile. \"I have been Master General for nine years. I have learned that gifts from kings always carry weight, even when no conditions are spoken. But the weight you describe—a stronger kingdom, more souls in grace, more voices raised in praise—that is weight the Order of Preachers was built to carry.\"\n\nHe drinks, considers.\n\n\"Tell me of the practicalities, Your Majesty. You speak of priests for parishes that cannot fund them. How many parishes? Granada alone, or Castile entire? The hospitals and food programs—administered by whom? Dominican brothers, or secular authorities with Dominican chaplains?\"\n\nHe leans back. \"And the endowment you have petitioned His Holiness for—I know of it, though I do not know the sum. What scale of commitment does Castile envision? A dozen friars? A hundred? A new province of the Order?\"\n\nHis eyes sharpen with practical calculation now, the theologian giving way to the administrator.\n\n\"I ask not to diminish your vision, but to understand it. The Order has some eight thousand friars across Christendom. We are stretched thin in places, abundant in others. If Castile calls, I must know what voice to answer with.\"\n\nWhat does Juan tell him?",

      "text": "Juan is asking Fra Bartholomew to explain what different levels of donation could accomplish for the Dominican Order in Castile. This is a practical question about scale and impact.\n\nI need to think about what the Dominican Order could realistically do in 15th century Castile with various levels of funding. Let me consider:\n\n1. The Dominican Order's structure - provinces, convents, friars\n2. What friars cost to maintain (food, housing, travel, books)\n3. What programs cost (hospitals, food distribution, new churches/convents)\n4. The scale of Castile's needs\n\nIn the 15th century:\n- A friar might cost 10-20 florins per year to maintain (modest living)\n- A small hospital might cost 200-500 florins to establish, plus ongoing costs\n- A new convent might cost 1,000-5,000 florins to build\n- Training new friars takes years\n\nJuan previously mentioned a Dominican endowment in his petitions to the Pope. Let me check what was proposed before...\n\nFrom the project files, I recall Juan proposed various endowments. The \"La Dote de la Reina Isabel\" was 25,000 florins perpetual for dowries. So Juan is thinking in terms of significant sums.\n\nFra Bartholomew would give Juan a practical breakdown of what different donation levels could accomplish. This is the kind of conversation a shrewd administrator would have.\n\nLet me think about realistic scales:\n\nSmall donation (5,000-10,000 florins):\n- Support 20-50 additional friars in Castile for a year\n- Or fund a few itinerant preachers for rural areas\n- Or establish one small hospital\n\nMedium donation (25,000-50,000 florins):\n- Establish a new Dominican house\n- Fund ongoing preaching missions\n- Create a modest hospital network\n- Support training of new Castilian friars\n\nLarge donation (100,000+ florins or perpetual endowment):\n\nA transformative investment would fundamentally reshape the Dominican presence across Castile. This level of funding could establish multiple new convents, create extensive hospital and charity networks, dramatically expand rural preaching efforts, and develop comprehensive training programs for new friars. Such resources might even support critical missionary work in Granada, enabling significant religious and cultural transformation.\n\nThe key is strategic implementation. A large donation isn't just about money, but about carefully planned, long-term institutional development that requires patience, careful selection of personnel, and a deep understanding of local religious and social dynamics.\n\nFra Bartholomew sets down his wine and pulls a piece of parchment toward him, reaching for his quill with the practiced motion of a man who thinks best with ink flowing.\n\n\"A fair question. Let me think aloud.\"\n\nHe scratches figures as he speaks.\n\n\"A Dominican friar costs perhaps fifteen to twenty florins per year to maintain—food, habit, books, travel. We live simply. But maintaining a friar is not the same as creating one. Formation takes seven years: novitiate, philosophy, theology, practical training. You cannot buy friars like you buy horses.\"\n\nHe looks up. \"So the question becomes: what can gold accomplish now, and what can it build for the future?\"\n\nHe draws a line, dividing the parchment.\n\n\"A modest gift—five thousand florins.\"\n\n\"This sustains what exists. It funds perhaps ten itinerant preachers for five years, traveling the rural areas of Castile where parishes cannot support a resident priest. They arrive, they preach, they hear confessions, they baptize, they move on. Better than nothing. But they do not stay.\"\n\n\"A substantial gift—twenty-five thousand florins.\"\n\n\"Now we can build. One new Dominican house in an underserved region—perhaps Granada, perhaps the northern mountains. A community of twelve to fifteen friars with a church, a modest hospital attached, a school for children. This becomes permanent. The house sustains itself through small endowments and alms once established. The friars preach in surrounding villages, train local men who show vocation, grow over generations.\"\n\nHe taps the quill. \"Twenty-five thousand also funds a studium—a house of studies where we train Castilian novices rather than sending them abroad. This multiplies our numbers over time. Ten novices this year become ten friars in seven years, who train ten more...\"\n\n\"A princely gift—fifty thousand florins or more.\"\n\n\"This transforms the Dominican presence in Castile entirely. Three new houses: one in Granada for the converted, one in the rural north, one perhaps in Extremadura or wherever need is greatest. A hospital network attached to each. A central studium generale rivaling Salamanca for Dominican formation. Funds for books, for copying manuscripts, for building libraries that preserve learning.\"\n\nHe pauses. \"And—importantly—funds to recruit. Not just Castilians, but friars from other provinces who might transfer to serve in your kingdom. Italians, Germans, Frenchmen who speak some Castilian or would learn. This accelerates everything by a decade.\"\n\n\"A perpetual endowment—land or rents generating annual income.\"\n\nFra Bartholomew sets down the quill and meets your eyes.\n\n\"This is different in kind, not just degree. A perpetual endowment means the work continues after you die. After I die. It becomes part of what the Order is in Castile, not merely what it does for a season. The hospitals never close for lack of funds. The preachers never stop walking. The schools never turn away a bright child because there is no money for ink.\"\n\nHe spreads his hands. \"But perpetual endowments require papal approval, legal frameworks, protections against future kings who may not share your vision. They are... complicated.\"\n\nHe sits back.\n\n\"So, Your Majesty. You asked what we could do. The answer is: almost anything, depending on scale. But I would counsel this—gold alone builds nothing lasting. Gold with genuine royal protection, gold with papal blessing, gold with the freedom for the Order to do its work without interference... that builds the kingdom of heaven you spoke of.\"\n\n\"What scale did you have in mind?\"\n\nWhat does Juan say?",

      "text": "Juan is offering 50,000 florins to the Dominicans - a princely gift. This is a significant moment. Fra Bartholomew has been cautious, probing, testing Juan's motives. Now Juan has made a concrete, substantial offer with no strings attached except the Order's own mission.\n\nI need to portray Fra Bartholomew's reaction authentically. This is an enormous sum - enough to transform the Dominican presence in Castile. A Master General of his experience would be:\n1. Genuinely moved/surprised by the scale\n2. Still cautious - this is almost too good\n3. Practical - thinking about implementation\n4. Grateful but maintaining dignity\n\nHe wouldn't grovel, but he also wouldn't be unmoved. This is a pivotal moment for the Order's work in Castile.\n\nI should also remember that Juan has a pending petition with the Pope for a Dominican endowment - this conversation is laying groundwork for that. Fra Bartholomew would know about the petition and would understand that papal approval would strengthen this arrangement.\n\nLet me write his reaction - a mix of genuine surprise, practical questions, and ultimately acceptance of Juan's sincerity.\n\nFra Bartholomew goes very still.\n\nIn the courtyard below, a bell rings for None. The sound seems to come from very far away.\n\n\"Fifty thousand florins,\" he repeats quietly. \"With no conditions save that we pursue our own mission.\"\n\nHe looks at you for a long moment—searching, perhaps, for the hidden hook, the unspoken expectation that will emerge later when you need something. His eyes are those of a man who has navigated Church politics for decades, who has seen generosity weaponized and piety performed.\n\nHe finds nothing.\n\nThe Master General of the Order of Preachers rises from his chair. For a moment you think he means to pace, to deliberate further. Instead, he walks around the desk and lowers himself to one knee before you.\n\n\"Your Majesty.\"\n\nHis voice has changed—the careful administrator replaced by something older, something closer to the young friar who first took vows decades ago.\n\n\"I have led this Order for nine years. I have begged funds from princes who gave with one hand and took with the other. I have watched good friars sent to places where they could do no good because politics demanded it. I have grown... cynical, perhaps. A sin I confess too rarely.\"\n\nHe looks up at you.\n\n\"What you offer is not merely gold. It is trust. You trust the Order to know its mission better than you do. Do you understand how rare that is? How precious?\"\n\nHe crosses himself.\n\n\"I accept your gift in the name of Saint Dominic and for the glory of God. The Order of Preachers will establish three houses in Castile—Granada, the north, and wherever else serves best. We will build hospitals. We will preach to the poor. We will train Castilian novices to carry this work forward after we are all dust.\"\n\nHe rises, composing himself with visible effort.\n\n\"There are practicalities. Papal approval for an endowment of this scale. Coordination with your bishops—the secular clergy can be... territorial. Selection of the right friars for the work, men of genuine vocation rather than men seeking comfortable postings.\"\n\nHe returns to his chair, but his bearing has changed. The negotiation is over. What remains is planning between allies.\n\n\"When you meet with His Holiness tomorrow, I would ask one thing. Mention this conversation. Tell him the Master General supports your petition for the Dominican endowment. Eugenius knows me—he knows I do not give such support lightly.\"\n\nA pause.\n\n\"Is there anything else you would have of me, Your Majesty? Any guidance for how we should begin?\"\n\nWhat does Juan say?",

Set up the next scene\n\nIt's still early-to-mid afternoon on the day of the Pope's return. Juan has a meeting with Eugenius tomorrow.

The reply comes within hours—he will receive you at the Camera offices the following morning.\n\nCHAOS ROLL: CAMERA REFORM PROGRESS & REBELLION REVELATIONS\n\nContext:\n\nParentucelli has been Extraordinary Commissioner for Camera Reform since March 1434—over a year now. He was working against passive resistance, \"misfiled\" documents, and institutional friction when the rebellion struck. The Pope fled, the city fell into chaos, and Parentucelli escaped to Florence with Eugenius.\n\nNow the Pope has returned, Juan has gathered evidence during the occupation, and Parentucelli must assess the damage—and the opportunities.\n\nFactors Favoring Progress:\n\nA year of systematic investigation before the crisis\n\nThe rebellion forced corrupt officials to act, potentially exposing themselves\n\nJuan's forces secured the Camera building and Castel Sant'Angelo archives\n\nCooperative witnesses emerged (Enzo Colonna, Maria the cook, Cardinals Sforza and Castiglione)\n\nCondulmer's correspondence with Basel was discovered\n\nMedici bank refused to support \"transitional authority\"—stayed neutral-helpful\n\nFactors Hindering Progress:\n\nThree weeks of chaos allowed document destruction\n\nSome officials fled Rome entirely\n\nKey intermediaries (Vittorio Colonna) escaped before Juan arrived\n\nPassive resistance may have hardened into active sabotage\n\nParentucelli was in Florence, unable to protect his work\n\nThe \"hollow center\" problem—institutional support remains thin\n\nD100 CHAOS TABLE: PARENTUCELLI'S REPORT\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-5\nCATASTROPHIC LOSSES — The rebellion was used as cover for systematic destruction. Key ledgers burned. Witness lists vanished. Three of Parentucelli's most trusted assistants are dead under suspicious circumstances. A year's work is largely undone. Parentucelli is devastated—they knew exactly what to destroy. Someone on the inside fed them information. The reform must essentially begin again.\n6-15\nSIGNIFICANT SETBACKS — Major documents disappeared during the chaos. Parentucelli's network of informants has scattered—some fled, some were intimidated into silence, some simply vanished. The Condulmer evidence Juan found is valuable but not enough to rebuild what was lost. Reform continues but has been set back six months or more. The corrupt learned from this—they will be more careful now.\n16-25\nMIXED RESULTS — Some records survived in Castel Sant'Angelo (Ser Giacomo Tartaglia's loyalty proved crucial). But the Camera building itself was partially ransacked. Parentucelli estimates perhaps 60% of his documentation remains intact. Several minor officials who fled have been identified—their flight itself is evidence of guilt. But the senior conspirators covered their tracks well.\n26-40\nHOLDING THE LINE — Parentucelli's precautions paid off. He had secretly copied the most damning evidence and sent duplicates to Florence before the crisis. The originals were destroyed, but the copies survive. The rebellion revealed perhaps a dozen mid-level officials whose behavior during the chaos confirmed suspicions. Condulmer's correspondence adds significant new threads to pursue. Reform continues, bloodied but unbowed.\n41-55\nUNEXPECTED OPPORTUNITIES — The rebellion forced people to choose sides, and choices reveal character. Parentucelli has a list of eighteen officials who actively helped the Colonna retainers—and twenty-three who risked themselves to protect papal property or warn the Pope. The wheat has been separated from the chaff. Combined with Juan's evidence, Parentucelli now has enough for targeted prosecutions rather than general suspicion.\n56-70\nTHE RATS FLED THE SHIP — When the Pope fell, the corrupt assumed he would never return. They stopped hiding. Parentucelli's agents (some remained in Rome) documented everything: who met with whom, who carried what documents where, who suddenly had money they shouldn't have. The evidence gathered during the three weeks of chaos exceeds what a year of careful investigation produced. Names, amounts, connections—all recorded.\n71-80\nCONFESSION CASCADE — The Pope's return terrified those who had revealed themselves. Three mid-level Camera officials have already approached Parentucelli seeking amnesty in exchange for testimony. They're naming names, explaining systems, providing documentation they had hidden as \"insurance.\" The conspiracy's middle layer is cracking. Parentucelli believes he can now trace corruption to its sources—not just Condulmer, but the networks beyond Rome.\n81-90\nTHE CARDINAL'S PAPERS — During Juan's occupation, a search of Cardinal Condulmer's private apartments (conducted with appropriate Church authority) uncovered a hidden cache of correspondence. Not just Basel letters—but years of financial records, payment schedules, lists of obligations owed and favors purchased. Condulmer kept meticulous records of his corruption, perhaps as leverage against others. Parentucelli calls it \"a map of the rot.\" Dozens of names across multiple countries.\n91-95\nDIVINE PROVIDENCE — A Camera clerk named Brother Paolo, believing the Pope would never return, attempted to sell sensitive documents to the Colonna. He was caught by Juan's men with a satchel containing ledgers that Parentucelli had sought for a year—records deliberately hidden from the Commissioner. Under interrogation, Paolo revealed where other documents were concealed. The rebellion intended to bury the reform; instead, it unearthed its foundations.\n96-100\nTHE WHOLE TAPESTRY — Everything aligned. Parentucelli's year of patient work, Juan's evidence from the occupation, Condulmer's papers, testimony from frightened officials, the Medici bank's quiet cooperation in verifying financial flows—it all connects. Parentucelli can now present the Pope with a complete picture: who has stolen what, for how long, through what mechanisms, with whose cooperation. Not suspicions—proof. The reform can now move from investigation to judgment.\n\nPlease roll d100 to determine what Parentucelli reports.",

      "text": "The Camera Offices\nMay 1435, Morning\n\nThe Apostolic Camera occupies a wing of the Vatican Palace—a warren of offices, scriptoriums, and archive rooms where the financial machinery of Christendom supposedly turns. When you arrive with Rodrigo de Mendoza and two guards, you find Tommaso Parentucelli standing amid chaos.\n\nClerks sort through piles of loose parchment. Empty shelves gape where ledgers once stood. A secretary argues with a guard about access to a locked room. The air smells of dust and old ink—and something else. Smoke damage.\n\nParentucelli looks up at your approach. He has aged five years in the fourteen months since you last saw him properly—the eager reformer who wept at the Pope's courage now shows grey at his temples and deep shadows beneath his eyes.\n\n\"Your Majesty.\" He bows, then gestures at the disorder around him. \"Forgive the state of things. We are... reconstructing.\"\n\nHe leads you to a private office—one of the few rooms that appears intact—and closes the door.\n\n\"I will be direct,\" Parentucelli says, lowering himself into a chair with the weariness of a man who has slept poorly for weeks. \"The news is neither as bad as I feared nor as good as I prayed.\"\n\nHe pulls a bound notebook from his desk—his own records, you realize, written in a cramped but precise hand.\n\n\"Ser Giacomo Tartaglia's loyalty saved us from catastrophe. When the Colonna retainers entered the city, he sealed Castel Sant'Angelo and refused all entry. The papal treasury—what remains of it—is intact. More importantly, the archives are intact. Bulls, treaties, correspondence with foreign powers, property records going back two centuries. If those had been lost or destroyed...\"\n\nHe shakes his head. \"But the Camera building itself was not so fortunate.\"\n\nWhat Was Lost:\n\n\"The working ledgers for 1433 and 1434—the current accounts showing receipts and expenditures—were kept here, not in the Castel. When I fled with the Holy Father, I took what I could carry. Personal notes. Copies of the most damning evidence.\"\n\nHe opens the notebook, showing pages of dense writing. \"These survived. But the originals did not.\"\n\n\"The building was ransacked during the second week. Not looted for gold—there was little enough of that. Ransacked for documents. Someone knew exactly what to look for. The ledgers showing payments to specific cardinals. The records of benefice transactions. The correspondence files for the past three years.\"\n\nHis jaw tightens. \"Perhaps sixty percent of my documentation remains. The copies I made. The archives in the Castel. Records that were stored elsewhere or that the raiders missed. But the forty percent that vanished... it was not random. They took what would have convicted them.\"\n\nWhat Was Revealed:\n\n\"Yet the rebellion was not without value.\" Parentucelli permits himself a thin, bitter smile. \"When men believe power has shifted, they act according to their true nature. I have identified eleven minor officials who fled Rome in the days after the Pope's escape. Their flight itself is evidence—innocent men do not run.\"\n\nHe produces a list. \"Three assistant scriptors. Two notaries. Four collection agents for the Papal States. A secretary in the datary. And one—\" he pauses, \"—one of my own assistants. A young man I trusted to copy sensitive documents. He vanished the night before Your Majesty entered the city.\"\n\n\"I also have the evidence you gathered during the occupation. The Condulmer correspondence with Basel. The testimony from Enzo Colonna, from the cook Maria, from Cardinals Sforza and Castiglione.\" He nods acknowledgment. \"That adds threads I did not have before. Connections between the Camera corruption and the conciliarist faction. The phrase 'our friend from Lyon' appears in three separate letters—someone is coordinating between Rome and Basel, and it is not Cardinal Rochetaillée.\"\n\nThe Assessment:\n\nParentucelli sets down the notebook and meets your eyes.\n\n\"The senior conspirators covered their tracks well, Your Majesty. Cardinal Condulmer sits in Church custody, silent as stone. Cardinal Colonna remains in the Campagna, sending polite letters expressing 'concern' for the Holy Father's welfare. Vittorio Colonna—the key intermediary—escaped before you arrived. Someone warned him.\"\n\n\"I can prosecute the minor officials who fled. I can build cases against perhaps a dozen mid-level functionaries whose guilt is now clear. But the men who designed the system, who profited most, who directed the rebellion...\" He spreads his hands. \"They knew what documents to destroy. They knew when to run and when to stay. They have been doing this for decades. I have been doing this for fourteen months.\"\n\nHe leans forward. \"The reform continues. I am not defeated. But I will not lie to you—we have been set back six months, perhaps more. And the corrupt have learned from this. They will be more careful now. The easy mistakes they made before, the careless records they kept... those are gone. What remains will be harder to find.\"\n\nA pause.\n\n\"Unless someone talks. Unless one of the senior men decides that confession serves him better than silence.\" His eyes are hard. \"That is what I pray for now. Not more documents. A single witness with genuine knowledge, willing to speak.\"\n\nWhat does Juan say or do?",

Prosecuting past crimes - bringing the guilty to justice\n\nHe's saying the first is more important than the second. This echoes the \"amnesty\" approach they discussed back in Chapter 2.20 - the idea that prosecuting past abuses would create too many enemies and unite the corrupt in desperate resistance. Better to build the new system and let the old sins fade.\n\nParentucelli initially wanted justice - \"twenty years of watching had built a fire in him\" - but Juan argued for pragmatism then. Now Juan is reminding him of this.\n\nI should have Parentucelli respond - perhaps with some struggle, because he's a man who wants justice, but also with recognition that Juan is right. The practical reform matters more than vengeance.\n\nParentucelli closes his eyes for a moment. When he opens them, there is something raw there—the idealist struggling with the pragmatist.\n\n\"You sound like yourself fourteen months ago, Your Majesty. When you counseled amnesty for the old dispensation.\" His voice is quiet. \"I agreed then. I agree now. And yet...\"\n\nHe rises and walks to the window, looking out over the Vatican courtyard where clerks and priests go about their business—some honest, some not, all of them watching to see which way the wind blows.\n\n\"Twenty years I watched this institution devour itself. Twenty years I copied documents and said nothing. When His Holiness gave me this commission, I thought... finally. Finally, justice.\" He turns back to you. \"But justice that destroys the institution it means to save is not justice. It is vengeance dressed in righteousness.\"\n\nHe returns to his chair, and when he speaks again, his voice is steadier.\n\n\"You are right. The new system matters more than punishing the old sins. If the Camera functions honestly from this day forward—if revenues are recorded, if accounts are published, if officials are supervised—then the reform succeeds regardless of whether Cardinal Condulmer ever confesses.\"\n\nA pause.\n\n\"I have been chasing ghosts in ledgers when I should be building walls against future theft.\"\n\nHe pulls out a fresh sheet of parchment, suddenly energized.\n\n\"The Camera reform bull His Holiness signed last year—the twenty articles—most remain unimplemented. Quarterly public accounts. Restructured banking relationships. New officials vetted for loyalty. The separation of Camera and College finances.\" He taps the parchment. \"These are what matter. If I spend the next year hunting evidence against men who have already destroyed the evidence, I accomplish nothing. If I spend it building the new system, then even if every guilty man escapes earthly judgment, the Church is stronger.\"\n\nHe looks at you with something like gratitude.\n\n\"Thank you, Your Majesty. I needed to hear that from someone other than my own doubts.\"\n\nA wry smile crosses his face. \"Though I confess—if Condulmer does decide to talk, I will not refuse to listen.\"\n\nIs there anything else Juan wishes to discuss with Parentucelli, or does he move on?",

The Inquisition mandate for Granada\n3. The Military Orders charter\n\nJuan also discussed with Eugenius during the procession:\n- Sending delegates to Basel to dilute the radical faction\n- The Swiss Guard (already agreed)\n- Naples investiture for Alfonso (already confirmed)\n- Support against Ottomans\n\nLet me create the scene of Juan meeting with the Pope privately.\n\nThe Vatican Palace\nPrivate Papal Apartments\nMay 1435, Afternoon\n\nThe Swiss Guard does not yet exist, but the Vatican Guards who remained loyal—augmented by a rotation of your own Caballeros—stand watch at the doors to the papal apartments. They admit you without question.\n\nPope Eugenius IV receives you not in the formal audience chamber but in his private study—a smaller room lined with books and devotional paintings, a crucifix on the wall, a simple prie-dieu in the corner worn smooth by the knees of popes. The afternoon light falls through high windows onto a desk covered with documents awaiting the papal signature.\n\nEugenius rises as you enter. He looks better than he did during the procession—rested, perhaps, or simply relieved to be home. The haunted quality you remember from your first meeting fourteen months ago has not entirely left his eyes, but it shares space now with something harder. A man who has been driven from his city twice and returned twice learns things about himself.\n\n\"Your Majesty.\" He gestures to a chair opposite his desk. Wine and figs sit untouched between you. \"We are alone. The secretaries have been dismissed.

      "text": "1. Granada and its future (Juan gave a brief answer)\n2. The Pope's security - Juan is offering to mobilize armies if needed, and supporting the idea of a loyal guard (the Swiss Guard they discussed earlier)\n3. The rebellion and what to do about those who rebelled\n\nThis is a significant conversation. The Pope needs to respond to these points. Let me think about how Eugenius would respond:\n\n1. On Granada - he'd probably accept Juan's brief explanation, perhaps with some mild inquiry but not pressing too hard\n2. On security - the Swiss Guard was already agreed upon in Chapter 2.35. Eugenius would be grateful for Juan's commitment\n3. On the rebellion - this is the meaty question. The Pope is in a difficult position:\n   - Cardinal Condulmer is his own nephew, now in Church custody\n   - Cardinal Colonna is a powerful Roman noble family, currently in the Campagna\n   - The Colonna have been enemies/rivals of popes for centuries\n   - There's evidence of Basel involvement\n   - The Pope was just restored by Juan's forces\n   - He needs to show strength but also can't start a civil war\n   - Church politics make it complicated to prosecute cardinals\n\nThe Pope would likely be thoughtful here. He's been through this before - he fled Rome once in 1434 as well in our timeline (though in this alternate timeline the specifics differ). He knows the Colonna are dangerous, but he also knows that heavy-handed action could backfire.\n\nLet me write the Pope's response, showing his political calculation while also showing he's not weak - he's a man who has found some steel after being driven out twice.\n\nEugenius listens, his fingers steepled beneath his chin. When you finish, he does not immediately respond. Instead, he rises and walks to the window, looking out over Rome—his city, twice lost and twice reclaimed.\n\n\"You speak of mobilizing armies,\" he says quietly. \"A king of Castile pledging to defend the Pope with military force. Do you understand what that means to Us? Not merely the protection—though God knows We need it—but what it signifies?\"\n\nHe turns back to face you.\n\n\"For a century, the papacy has been a prize fought over by Italian factions. Colonna against Orsini. Naples against Milan. France reaching down from the north. We have survived by playing them against each other, by being too weak to threaten and too useful to destroy.\" His voice hardens. \"That is not how a Vicar of Christ should live.\"\n\nHe returns to his desk but does not sit.\n\n\"The Swiss Guard—yes. We agreed to this. One hundred fifty men, perhaps two hundred, recruited from the cantons where loyalty can still be purchased with honest coin and kept with honest treatment. Men with no Italian entanglements, no Roman families to protect or avenge. This We will do.\"\n\nOn the matter of the rebellion, Eugenius's expression grows complicated—anger and calculation and something that might be grief, all braided together.\n\n\"You ask what We plan for those who rebelled.\" He picks up a letter from his desk, glances at it, sets it down. \"Cardinal Colonna writes from his estates in the Campagna. He expresses profound relief at Our safe return. He deplores the violence committed by certain unfortunate elements among his family's retainers. He offers to visit Rome personally to demonstrate his continued devotion to the Holy See.\"\n\nThe Pope's lip curls.\n\n\"He thinks Us a fool. He thinks that because We fled, We are weak. That because We returned only with Castilian swords at Our back, We have no strength of Our own.\"\n\nEugenius sits heavily.\n\n\"And perhaps he is right. Perhaps We are weak. But We are also angry, Your Majesty. And a weak man who is angry can still bite.\"\n\nHe meets your eyes.\n\n\"Cardinal Francesco Condulmer—Our own nephew—sits in Church custody. The evidence you gathered suggests he conspired with Basel, that he spoke of 'new arrangements' and 'transitional authority.' He has said nothing. He will say nothing. He believes family loyalty will protect him, that We will not move against Our own blood.\"\n\nA pause.\n\n\"He may be right about that too. We do not know yet. The thought of condemning Our sister's son...\"\n\nHe shakes his head, pushing the thought aside.\n\n\"But Condulmer is Church business. Cardinals are judged by the Church. What concerns Us more immediately is the Colonna. They are not merely churchmen—they are a power in the Papal States. They hold castles, command soldiers, collect revenues that should flow to Rome. If We move against them openly, We risk war. If We do nothing, We invite them to try again.\"\n\nEugenius spreads his hands.\n\n\"So We ask you, old friend—you who have conquered Granada, who have navigated the vipers of Basel, who restored Us to this city. What would you do with the Colonna? What does a king do with a great house that has rebelled but not been broken?\"\n\nWhat does Juan advise?",

      "text": "Juan is advising Eugenius to take a hard line against the Colonna - to summon them to trial, and if they refuse, to hunt them down and destroy those who shelter them. This is the approach of a medieval king, not a churchman.\n\nEugenius needs to respond to this. He's a pope, not a king. He has spiritual weapons (excommunication, interdict) but limited military force. The Colonna are a powerful Roman family with centuries of influence. They've produced popes, cardinals, senators. Moving against them openly risks war in the Papal States.\n\nBut Eugenius is also angry. He's been driven from Rome twice. His own nephew may have betrayed him. He's tired of being weak.\n\nHow would Eugenius react to this advice?\n\nHe might:\n1. Acknowledge the appeal of Juan's approach while noting the practical difficulties\n2. Consider a modified version - using Church authority (trials, excommunication) rather than pure military force\n3. Ask about the specifics of how Juan handled similar situations in Castile\n4. Express concern about whether he has the strength to do this\n5. Consider whether there's a middle path\n\nThe Pope has some leverage:\n- Juan's forces are still in Rome\n- The Colonna are weakened by the rebellion's failure\n- Cardinal Colonna's position in the Church makes him vulnerable to ecclesiastical proceedings\n- The evidence gathered during the occupation\n\nBut he also has constraints:\n- He can't rely on Castilian troops forever\n- Other Italian powers might intervene if he seems too aggressive\n- The College of Cardinals might resist moves against one of their own\n- He needs to appear just, not vengeful\n\nI think Eugenius would be tempted by Juan's advice but also recognize that he's not a king. He might explore what a papal version of this approach would look like - using spiritual weapons and ecclesiastical trials rather than armies.\n\nEugenius is silent for a long moment. His fingers drum against the desk—a nervous habit you have not seen from him before.\n\n\"You conquered Granada,\" he says slowly. \"You broke the power of the Infantes who plotted against you. You have done what you describe.\" He looks at you. \"But you had armies. You had loyal nobles who would ride at your command. You had a kingdom united behind its king.\"\n\nHe gestures at the walls around him.\n\n\"We have... what? A guard that failed Us once already. A college of cardinals where half the members would celebrate Our downfall. Italian powers who would intervene the moment they sensed weakness—or strength that threatened their interests. Naples to the south, Milan to the north, Venice watching everything.\"\n\nHe rises again, pacing now—a man arguing with himself as much as with you.\n\n\"And yet. And yet.\"\n\nHe stops at the crucifix on the wall, studying it.\n\n\"You are right that mercy shown to rebels invites rebellion. We learned that lesson when We forgave the first offenses, when We tried to reconcile rather than punish. They took Our mercy for weakness. They will do so again unless...\"\n\nHe turns back to you.\n\n\"We cannot summon the Colonna to trial as a king summons vassals. But We can summon Cardinal Prospero Colonna to answer for his family's actions before an ecclesiastical tribunal. He is a prince of the Church. He answers to Us in matters of faith and discipline. If he refuses to appear, he is contumacious—and contumacy has consequences.\"\n\nHis eyes narrow, calculating now.\n\n\"The secular Colonna—the cousins, the retainers, the men who actually held the bridges and threatened Our person—they are subjects of the Papal States. They owe Us temporal obedience as well as spiritual. If We declare them rebels and strip their holdings...\"\n\nA pause.\n\n\"We would need force to make it real. Not Castilian force—that would make Us appear a puppet of foreign powers. Italian force. Orsini might move against their ancient rivals if We gave them license. Florence might assist if We offered the right concessions. Naples...\"\n\nHe shakes his head.\n\n\"Naples is Alfonso's prize, and Alfonso is your ally. Perhaps that is the key. If the powers of Italy understood that moving against the Pope means moving against a coalition—Castile, Aragon, Naples united, with the Emperor's blessing from Como still fresh—perhaps the Colonna would find themselves very alone.\"\n\nEugenius returns to his chair, sitting heavily.\n\n\"Tell Us plainly, Your Majesty. If We move against the Colonna—truly move, not merely protest and posture—can We count on Castile? Not troops in the streets of Rome, but... the shadow of strength you once spoke of. Letters making clear that Castile stands with the Pope. Ships in the harbor if needed. The knowledge that harming Us means answering to you.\"\n\nHis eyes meet yours.\n\n\"We are asking if you meant what you swore in St. Peter's fourteen months ago. That you would defend the Pope so worldly matters could not influence him. Is that oath still good?\"\n\nWhat does Juan say?",

      "text": "Juan is essentially pushing back on Eugenius's request, pointing out the political complications of Castilian military intervention in the Papal States. He's offering an alternative framing - using the \"Defensor Romaniae\" title as justification for intervention, which would make it appear as a religious duty rather than foreign invasion.\n\nThis is a persuasion situation where Juan is trying to:\n1. Get Eugenius to understand the political risks of direct Castilian intervention\n2. Propose an alternative framing that serves both their interests\n3. Potentially get Eugenius to formally invoke the Defensor title as cover for intervention\n\nLet me check the persuasion skill document first.\n\n**What is Juan asking?**\nJuan is pushing back on Eugenius's request for a blanket commitment of Castilian military force. He's pointing out the political dangers of appearing to invade the Papal States, and suggesting an alternative framework: that Eugenius formally invoke the \"Defensor Romaniae\" title to provide cover for any intervention. This would frame it as a religious duty rather than foreign invasion.\n\n**Who is Eugenius IV?**\n- A Pope who has been driven from Rome twice\n- Returned both times only with outside help (now Castilian)\n- Desperate for security but also concerned about appearing weak or a puppet\n- Politically astute - understands the dynamics of Italian powers\n- Has deep gratitude to Juan but also pride in papal authority\n- Just asked Juan directly if his oath is still good - now Juan is qualifying it\n\n**What does Eugenius want?**\n- Security and protection\n- To not appear weak or dependent\n- To punish those who rebelled\n- To maintain papal authority and dignity\n- A clear commitment from Juan\n\n**What is Juan actually proposing?**\nHe's not refusing to help - he's explaining the political realities and suggesting a face-saving framework. The \"Defensor\" title could provide legitimate cover for Castilian intervention without it appearing as invasion.\n\n**Is this a reasonable request?**\nYes, actually. Juan is offering a *better* solution than a raw military commitment. He's showing political sophistication and giving Eugenius a way to maintain dignity while still getting protection.\n\n**Success Factors:**\n1. Juan is right about the optics - naked Castilian intervention would look like invasion\n2. The Defensor Romaniae title already exists and has been granted\n3. This gives Eugenius a framework to request help without appearing a puppet\n4. Juan is not refusing - he's refining how help would be delivered\n5. Juan has already proven his commitment (just restored Rome)\n\n6. Juan demonstrates diplomatic sensitivity to Eugenius's emotional state\n7. The proposal creates a mutually beneficial political solution\n\n**Potential Diplomatic Challenges:**\nJuan's nuanced approach risks being misinterpreted as hesitation. While strategically sound, his conditional framing might trigger Eugenius's insecurity. The Pope, emotionally vulnerable after repeated displacements, could perceive this as a withdrawal of support rather than a sophisticated diplomatic maneuver.\n\nThe proposal's delicate balance depends entirely on Eugenius's emotional receptivity. Depending on his psychological state, he might view Juan's careful framing as either strategic wisdom or calculated evasion.\n\nPERSUASION ANALYSIS\n\nJuan Proposing the \"Defensor\" Framework\n\nStep 1: Identify the Ask\n\nJuan is not refusing Eugenius's request—he is reframing it. He's pointing out that direct Castilian military intervention would appear as foreign invasion, potentially making Eugenius look like a puppet. Instead, he proposes that Eugenius formally invoke Juan's title of Defensor Romaniae as the legal and spiritual framework for intervention, transforming \"Castilian invasion\" into \"the Defender of Christendom answering the Pope's call against rebellion.\"\n\nThis is a sophisticated diplomatic move that protects both parties—but Eugenius just asked a direct emotional question and may interpret nuance as hesitation.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate Juan's Approach\n\nArgument Quality: Strong. Juan correctly identifies that naked military intervention would undermine papal authority by making Eugenius appear dependent on foreign arms. The Defensor framework provides legitimacy.\n\nCultural Appropriateness: Mixed. Eugenius asked \"Is your oath still good?\" Juan responded with political analysis rather than emotional reassurance. This is wise but may not be what Eugenius needs in this moment.\n\nBenefits Offered: Good. The framework protects papal dignity and provides a precedent for future calls on Castilian aid.\n\nConcerns Addressed: Partial. Juan addresses the political optics but does not directly address Eugenius's emotional need for reassurance.\n\nFace-Saving: Excellent. The Defensor framework makes papal requests for help look like commanding the defender rather than begging for rescue.\n\nRespect Shown: High. Juan explicitly says \"I am no pope\" and acknowledges he can only share what he would do, not dictate.\n\nStep 3: Identify All Factors\n\nSuccess Factors:\n\nJuan is politically correct. Castilian armies marching into Italy without framework would look like invasion\n\nThe Defensor Romaniae title already exists. Juan holds it; this isn't creating something new\n\nJuan just proved his commitment. He restored Rome with his personal guard—actions speak\n\nThe proposal protects papal dignity. Eugenius can \"summon the Defender\" rather than \"beg for rescue\"\n\nJuan is thinking of Eugenius's interests. This shows care for how the Pope appears to other powers\n\nJuan is not refusing. He's refining the mechanism, not the commitment\n\nStrategic clarity. A defined framework prevents future misunderstandings\n\nFailure Factors:\n\nEugenius asked an emotional question; Juan gave a political answer. The Pope said \"Is your oath still good?\" He wanted \"Yes, absolutely\" not \"Let me explain the complications\"\n\nThis feels like adding conditions. What was sworn unconditionally now seems to require papal invocation\n\nEugenius is emotionally raw. Twice exiled, recently terrified, seeking security—not a lecture on optics\n\nPride. The Vicar of Christ should not need to formally request what should flow from Christian duty\n\nThe Defensor title was for fighting Ottomans. Stretching it to cover internal rebellions may feel like legalistic sophistry\n\nComplexity when simplicity was desired. Eugenius wanted a shield; Juan is offering a legal framework\n\nFear of abandonment. Every qualification sounds like a reason not to help when it matters most\n\nStep 4: Factor Balance Assessment\n\nJuan's proposal is objectively wise—it protects both parties and provides sustainable framework. But Eugenius is not in a rational state; he's seeking emotional security after trauma. The failure factors are mostly emotional and perceptual, not substantive.\n\nThis creates a situation where:\n\nOn low rolls, Eugenius hears the qualifications and fears Juan is finding reasons not to commit\n\nOn medium rolls, Eugenius understands the logic but remains unsatisfied emotionally\n\nOn high rolls, Eugenius recognizes the wisdom and appreciates Juan thinking of papal dignity\n\nThe request is fundamentally reasonable, so agreement is possible across much of the table—but the manner of agreement varies significantly.\n\nD100 TABLE: THE DEFENSOR FRAMEWORK\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-10\nWOUNDED PRIDE — Eugenius's fear crystallizes into anger. \"You speak of frameworks and titles and optics while We sit in a palace guarded by your men because Our own guards failed Us. Perhaps you are right that your armies would look like invasion. Perhaps that is because they would be an invasion—of a pope too weak to defend himself, being managed by a king who now explains why his oath requires conditions.\" The conversation has damaged the relationship. Eugenius will remain formally correct but trust has cracked.\n11-25\nCOLD DISAPPOINTMENT — Eugenius's face closes. \"We asked if your oath was still good. You have answered with politics.\" He does not reject the Defensor framework outright, but neither does he embrace it. \"We will consider what you have said. Perhaps you are right that We must formally invoke titles to receive what was freely sworn. Perhaps that is simply how kings are.\" The audience ends politely but something has been lost. Eugenius will need reassurance before warmth returns.\n26-40\nFRUSTRATED ACKNOWLEDGMENT — Eugenius sighs heavily. \"You are not wrong, Your Majesty. We know you are not wrong. Italian powers would use Castilian armies as excuse to intervene themselves—'protecting the Pope from the Spanish,' they would say, while carving up Our lands.\" He rubs his temples. \"But it galls Us to admit that even Our defender must be... managed in how he defends.\" He accepts the logic but the emotional need remains unmet. The framework is tacitly accepted but Eugenius remains unsettled.\n41-55\nRELUCTANT UNDERSTANDING — Eugenius is quiet for a long moment. \"You think like a cardinal,\" he says again, echoing his earlier words—but this time with more weariness than admiration. \"Very well. If We must invoke the Defensor to receive the Defensor's aid, We shall invoke it. You have made your commitment clear while also making clear its limits.\" He straightens. \"Draft the language. Show Us what such an invocation would look like. We will not say you are wrong—but We will also not pretend this is what We hoped to hear.\" Functional agreement, but the relationship needs tending.\n56-70\nMEASURED ACCEPTANCE — Eugenius nods slowly, thinking it through. \"The Defensor Romaniae... summoned by the Pope to defend Christendom against rebellion that threatens the unity of the Church.\" His political mind engages. \"That is not the Ottoman threat We intended when We granted the title, but... rebellion against the Vicar of Christ is an attack on Christendom's unity.\" He looks at you with something approaching appreciation. \"You are protecting Our dignity, aren't you? Ensuring that We command aid rather than beg for it.\" A small, tired smile. \"Very well. We accept the framework. Help Us draft the invocation properly.\"\n71-85\nGRATEFUL RECOGNITION — Eugenius's expression shifts as he truly hears what Juan is offering. \"You are not hedging, are you? You are... building a fortress around Our authority, not a cage around your commitment.\" He rises and moves to the window. \"If you simply marched armies here, every Italian prince would cry foreign domination. But if the Pope summons his Defender against rebels... then you come as Our instrument, not Our master.\" He turns back. \"This is wiser than what We asked for. We were thinking of survival. You are thinking of how We survive without becoming a Spanish puppet in Italian eyes. We are grateful, old friend.\"\n86-100\nDIPLOMATIC EMBRACE — Eugenius's eyes brighten with understanding. \"Of course. Of course.\" He begins pacing with sudden energy. \"The Defensor Romaniae—a title with ancient echoes, granted by a Pope, invoked by a Pope. Not a foreign king bringing his armies uninvited, but the Shield of Christendom answering the Vicar's call. This is better than what We asked for.\" He stops and faces you. \"We shall draft the invocation immediately. And We shall make it broad—rebellion against papal authority, attacks on Church property, threats to the unity of Christendom. Let Cardinal Colonna wonder whether his next move will bring Castilian swords to his door at Our command.\" He clasps your arm. \"You give Us a weapon, not just a shield. Thank you.\"\n\nPlease roll d100.",

The wounded look that had begun to form—the fear that Juan was finding reasons to qualify his commitment—gives way to something else as he truly hears what is being offered.\n\n\"You are not hedging, are you?\" He speaks slowly, working through it. \"You are... building a fortress around Our authority, not a cage around your commitment.\"\n\nHe rises and moves to the window, looking out over the Vatican gardens where Swiss mercenaries will one day stand guard—but not yet. For now, it is Castilian knights who patrol below.\n\n\"If you simply marched armies here whenever trouble arose, every Italian prince would cry foreign domination. Milan would send 'protective forces' to 'balance' your presence. Venice would demand guarantees.

We were thinking of survival—of swords and walls and who would come when We called. You are thinking of how We survive without becoming a Spanish puppet in Italian eyes. Without giving Our enemies the weapon of calling Us a foreign creature.\"\n\nHe returns to his desk and sits, but his bearing has changed. The desperate quality is gone, replaced by something more like his old self—the politician, the survivor, the man who has outlasted enemies before.\n\n\"We are grateful, old friend. Truly grateful.\" He pulls a fresh sheet of parchment toward him. \"We shall need to draft the invocation carefully.

Perhaps he will grovel convincingly enough that We need not test this new weapon.\"\n\nThe smile turns cold.\n\n\"And perhaps he will not.

The season is favorable—May offers good Mediterranean sailing weather before the summer heat.\n\nTraveling party:\n\nJuan and his household\n\n~50 Caballeros del Defensor (the remainder stay in Rome supporting papal security)\n\nSeveral ships from the fleet\n\nFactors Favoring Safe Passage:\n\nGood sailing season\n\nExperienced fleet after Constantinople voyage\n\nFriendly waters (Aragonese Sicily, Naples now secure)\n\nShort crossing to Spanish coast\n\nNew storm warning protocols established after Mistral disaster\n\nFactors Creating Risk:\n\nBarbary corsairs always a threat\n\nAny sea voyage carries inherent danger\n\nNews from home may have accumulated\n\nEvents elsewhere may have developed (Basel, Constantinople, Portugal)\n\nD100 CHAOS TABLE: THE VOYAGE HOME\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-5\nDISASTER AT SEA — Storm, corsair attack, or shipwreck. Significant losses—men, ships, possibly important passengers. Juan survives but the journey becomes a crisis. Weeks of delay. Arrives home to find problems have compounded in his absence.\n6-10\nGRAVE NEWS AWAITS — The voyage is uneventful, but messengers intercept the fleet at a port stop with terrible tidings. A death, a rebellion, a betrayal—something that changes everything. Juan must decide whether to continue home or divert.\n11-20\nTROUBLED PASSAGE — Contrary winds, minor damage, a bout of illness among the crew. Nothing catastrophic but the journey takes longer than planned—nearly four weeks instead of two. Arriving exhausted, Juan finds correspondence piled high and decisions delayed too long.\n21-35\nUNEVENTFUL JOURNEY — The sea is calm, the winds fair, the route familiar. Juan arrives in Castile without incident after approximately three weeks. The kingdom has continued functioning under Álvaro de Luna's capable hand. Normal business awaits—nothing urgent, nothing dire.\n36-50\nMINOR COMPLICATIONS — A brief storm forces shelter in a friendly port (perhaps Naples, where Alfonso is consolidating). A few days' delay, but the stop yields useful intelligence or a productive meeting. Journey otherwise unremarkable. Toledo welcomes its king home.\n51-65\nPRODUCTIVE PASSAGE — Good weather and time at sea allow Juan to review accumulated correspondence, plan next steps, perhaps draft letters. Arrives home mentally prepared rather than exhausted. One piece of good news awaits—a project succeeding, a negotiation concluded favorably, a birth or recovery.\n66-80\nFORTUNATE TIMING — The fleet makes excellent time, arriving ahead of schedule. This proves advantageous—Juan is present for something that benefits from royal attention, or avoids a problem that would have caught him mid-voyage. The kingdom is in good order; Lucia and the children thrive.\n81-90\nBLESSED VOYAGE — Everything aligns. Swift passage, following seas, a pod of dolphins escorting the flagship (sailors call it lucky). Juan arrives rested and finds good news waiting: positive developments from Basel, Constantinople, or Portugal. The realm prospers. A moment to breathe before the next challenge.\n91-95\nUNEXPECTED OPPORTUNITY — The voyage brings an unplanned encounter: a ship bearing important news, a meeting with a useful figure at a port of call, intelligence about enemies or opportunities that Juan would not otherwise have received. Something valuable falls into his lap.\n96-100\nPROVIDENCE SMILES — The journey itself becomes significant. A chance meeting, a discovery, a piece of news that opens new possibilities. Juan arrives home not merely safe but enriched—new alliances hinted, new paths revealed, the sense that God's hand guided the voyage for purposes not yet fully clear.\n\nPlease roll d100 for the voyage home.",

Fifty Caballeros del Defensor line the rails of the Princess Catalina as Rome's coast fades to a brown smudge on the horizon. The remainder stay behind—your contribution to papal security until the Swiss Guard can be recruited and trained.\n\nFor three days, the voyage proceeds perfectly. The fleet rounds the southern tip of the Italian peninsula, passes through the Strait of Messina with its treacherous currents, and makes good time along the Sicilian coast.\n\nThen the sky darkens.\n\nOff the Coast of Sicily\nMay 18, 1435\n\nPascual—the veteran lookout whose weather-eye saved lives during the Mistral—spots it first. Three cannon shots boom across the water, the new storm warning protocol proving its worth.\n\nThis time, the fleet is ready. Sails shorten. Cargo is secured. The ships turn toward the nearest safe harbor as the squall sweeps in from the south—not the killing fury of the Mistral, but enough to make open water dangerous.\n\nYou make port at Syracuse, the ancient Sicilian city now under Aragonese control. The harbor is crowded with merchant vessels sheltering from the same blow, and the castle flies Alfonso V's banner.\n\nSyracuse\nThree Days of Enforced Delay\n\nThe storm batters the coast for two days before subsiding into sullen grey skies and choppy seas. Your captains advise waiting for calmer waters—another day, perhaps two.\n\nSyracuse's governor, a Catalan knight named Pere de Cardona, receives you with appropriate honors. He is Alfonso's man, administering this corner of Sicily while his king consolidates the Neapolitan conquest.\n\nOver dinner in the castle's great hall—modest by royal standards but comfortable—Cardona proves a useful source of intelligence.\n\n\"His Majesty of Aragon remains in Naples,\" Cardona reports, refilling your wine cup. \"Queen Giovanna still breathes, but barely. The physicians say autumn at the latest. Perhaps sooner.\" He shrugs. \"King Alfonso prepares for the transition. René of Anjou has sent letters protesting, of course, but the French have their own troubles. No army will cross the Alps to challenge Aragonese Naples.\"\n\nHe leans closer, lowering his voice.\n\n\"There is other news, Your Majesty. From the east. A Venetian galley put in here last week, fleeing the same weather that delays you now. The captain spoke of... movements. Ottoman movements. Sultan Murad has returned from his campaign in Anatolia. The fleet at Gallipoli is being reinforced.\"\n\nCardona's expression is carefully neutral. \"The truce you negotiated still holds, I am told. But the Venetians are nervous. They always are, of course—their trade depends on Ottoman goodwill. But this time...\"\n\nHe trails off, letting the implication hang.\n\nOn the third day, the weather clears. The fleet resupplies with fresh water and provisions—Syracuse's markets are well-stocked—and you set sail for the final leg to Cartagena.\n\nThe remainder of the voyage is uneventful. Fair winds carry you across the Mediterranean, past the Balearics, to the Spanish coast. From Cartagena, the overland journey to Toledo takes another week.\n\nToledo\nEarly June 1435\n\nThe bells of the cathedral ring as you ride through the gates. Word of your approach preceded you by a day, and the city has turned out to welcome its king. Álvaro de Luna meets you at the Alcázar steps, his face showing relief beneath the formal welcome.\n\n\"Your Majesty.\" He bows. \"The kingdom endures. Your queen thrives. Your children grow. We have much to discuss—but it can wait until you have rested.\"\n\nInside, Lucia embraces you with an intensity that speaks of long separation and longer worry. Princess Catalina, now nearly three, demands to be lifted and shown the gifts you brought from Rome. Prince Fernando, eighteen months old, regards you with the suspicious curiosity of a child who does not quite remember this large man who claims to be his father. Princess Bianca, barely eight months old, sleeps through your arrival entirely.\n\nHome.\n\nBut Cardona's words linger: Ottoman movements. The fleet at Gallipoli reinforced. The Venetians are nervous.\n\nThe truce holds. For now.\n\nWhat does Juan do?",

Includes various causes of death that were historically common\n4. Also includes outcomes where she survives but with complications\n5. Has a reasonable chance of survival - maybe 50-60% given royal care\n\nThis is a single roll to determine her fate through childhood, not an annual roll.\n\nYou're right—I conflated the journey with news that should be rolled separately. Let me set that aside and focus on Bianca.\n\nCHAOS ROLL: PRINCESS BIANCA'S CHILDHOOD SURVIVAL\n\nThe Perils of Medieval Infancy and Childhood\n\nContext:\n\nPrincess Bianca of Castile was born September 14, 1434, in Naples. She is now approximately eight months old. The delivery was normal (Roll: 44), and she has shown no signs of illness thus far.\n\nHistorical Reality:\n\nChild mortality in 15th-century Europe was devastating, even among royalty:\n\n30-40% of children died before age 5, even in noble households\n\n50% of all deaths occurred before age 10\n\nCommon killers: smallpox, measles, dysentery, \"fevers\" (various infections), plague, respiratory ailments, accidents\n\nInfancy (first year) was the most dangerous period\n\nThe \"dangerous years\" extended roughly until age 7-10, after which survival rates improved dramatically\n\nFactors Affecting Bianca:\n\nRoyal household: Better nutrition, warmth, clothing than common children\n\nWet nurses: Standard for royalty, but introduced disease transmission risk\n\nCourt exposure: Many visitors = many disease vectors\n\nMedical care: Best available, but 15th-century medicine was often harmful\n\nTravel: Royal children sometimes traveled with the court, increasing exposure\n\nSiblings: Fernando (18 months) and Catalina (nearly 3) could transmit childhood illnesses\n\nWhat We're Rolling For:\n\nDoes Bianca survive childhood (to approximately age 10)? This single roll determines her fate through the dangerous early years.\n\nD100 CHAOS TABLE: BIANCA'S FATE\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-5\nDEATH IN INFANCY — Bianca does not survive her first year. A sudden fever, a cough that will not clear, the terrible stillness that every parent of this era dreads. She dies before her first birthday (before September 1435). The royal household mourns. Lucia is devastated. A small tomb in Toledo Cathedral.\n6-12\nDEATH IN EARLY CHILDHOOD (Age 1-3) — Bianca survives infancy but succumbs to one of the countless illnesses that claim young children. Measles, smallpox, a bloody flux—the physicians do what they can, which is little. She dies sometime between 1435 and 1437. Old enough that her personality had begun to emerge. The grief is sharper for the knowing.\n13-20\nDEATH IN LATER CHILDHOOD (Age 4-7) — Bianca grows past the most dangerous years, showing signs of the person she might become. Then illness strikes—perhaps during an epidemic that sweeps through Toledo, perhaps a sickness brought by a visitor to court. She dies between 1438 and 1441. Old enough to be remembered clearly. Old enough to leave a hole.\n21-28\nSURVIVES BUT FRAGILE — Bianca lives, but a serious childhood illness leaves her constitution weakened. She is often sick, requires careful management, cannot travel freely or endure exertion. She will survive to adulthood but will be known as \"delicate.\" Marriage negotiations will be complicated by concerns about her health and childbearing capacity.\n29-35\nSURVIVES WITH LASTING MARK — A childhood illness (perhaps smallpox) leaves Bianca scarred or marked in some visible way. She is otherwise healthy and strong, but her appearance is affected. In an era when royal marriages are partly about bloodline display, this complicates her value as a diplomatic match—though it says nothing of her character or capabilities.\n36-45\nSURVIVES WITH MINOR DIFFICULTIES — Bianca endures the usual childhood illnesses but recovers from each. She has one serious bout of sickness (perhaps around age 3-4) that frightens the household, but she pulls through. She emerges into later childhood healthy, though perhaps with a lingering minor issue (weak chest, sensitive digestion, or similar). Nothing that prevents a normal life.\n46-65\nSURVIVES NORMALLY — Bianca navigates childhood with the usual array of minor illnesses, fevers, and scares, but nothing life-threatening. She grows into a healthy child, then a healthy young woman. The ordinary miracle of medieval survival—unremarkable only because it is hoped for, never because it is guaranteed.\n66-80\nTHRIVES — Bianca proves a robust child, rarely ill, quick to recover when sickness touches her. She has her mother's constitution (Lucia has shown exceptional health through multiple pregnancies). By age seven, she is strong, active, and healthy. The physicians remark on her good fortune. Her survival is never seriously in doubt after infancy.\n81-90\nREMARKABLY HEALTHY — Bianca seems almost charmed. While other children in the household or court fall ill, she remains healthy. While epidemics sweep through Toledo, she escapes untouched. Servants whisper that she was born under a blessed star. She grows into a vigorous, healthy child who has never given her parents a moment's medical worry.\n91-100\nBLESSED WITH VITALITY — Bianca not only survives but flourishes in a way that draws comment. She is strong, energetic, rarely still. She weathers every childhood illness quickly and completely. By age ten, it is clear she has inherited the best of both bloodlines—Trastámara endurance and Este vitality. She will be a prize in marriage negotiations: healthy, proven hardy, from fertile stock.\n\nPlease roll d100 for Princess Bianca's fate.",

Concerned about:\n   - Castilian expansion\n   - Papal alliance (France has conciliarist leanings)\n   - Growing Iberian unity (Castile-Portugal-Aragon bloc)\n   - Naples going to Alfonso (French had Angevin claims)\n\n2. **England** - In Hundred Years War with France, so probably not focused on Castile. But:\n   - English trade interests in Castile\n   - Could be concerned about Iberian naval power\n   - Generally distracted by French war\n\n3. **Burgundy** - Powerful, wealthy, ambitious. Duke Philip the Good:\n   - Interested in crusading (Order of the Golden Fleece)\n   - Could see Juan as rival for crusade leadership\n   - Has Mediterranean trade interests\n   - Neutral to friendly generally\n\n4. **Italian Powers:**\n   - **Venice** - Concerned about Ottoman situation, trade\n   - **Milan** - Visconti, ambitious, could see opportunity\n   - **Genoa** - Trade rivals with everyone\n   - **Florence** - Medici, generally pragmatic, supported Pope\n\nI analyze the remaining potential challengers to Juan's expanding influence. German princes remain internally focused, while Hungary and Poland prioritize the Ottoman threat. Scotland's alliance with France is distant and unlikely to directly impact Juan's position. \n\nThe critical assessment hinges on whether Juan's actions are provocative enough to trigger a coordinated Christian response. Current evidence suggests not - he's strategically defensive, consolidating Granada and supporting papal and Byzantine interests without directly threatening other Christian powers. His alliances and military investments appear more protective than expansionist, potentially mitigating immediate international backlash.\n\nThe legislative approach with Basel has subtly reduced tensions, and Juan's collaboration with the Pope demonstrates diplomatic sophistication. European powers are distracted by their own conflicts - the ongoing France-England war and Italian regional rivalries - which further reduces likelihood of unified action against him.\n\nHowever, the rapid pace of Juan's rise cannot be ignored. The unprecedented Iberian bloc's formation, naval expansion, and strategic Mediterranean positioning create underlying nervousness among potential rivals. His ability to project power beyond Iberia and influence Church appointments suggests a long-term strategic vision that smart rulers would view with cautious concern.\n\nThe most probable scenario remains diplomatic observation with subtle probing, balanced between potential hostility and unexpected collaboration.\n\nBianca's Fate Noted: Roll 24 — Survives But Fragile. A serious childhood illness will leave her constitution weakened. She will live, but will be known as \"delicate,\" complicating future marriage negotiations.\n\nCHAOS ROLL: CHRISTIAN POWERS' POSTURE TOWARD CASTILE\n\nThe Year 1435\n\nContext:\n\nJuan II of Castile has risen with remarkable speed:\n\nConquered Granada (1432-1433)\n\nAllied with Pope Eugenius IV (papal reforms, Defensor Romaniae title)\n\nAllied with Emperor Sigismund (Declaration of Como)\n\nAllied with King Duarte I of Portugal (unprecedented maritime union, Roll 99)\n\nAllied with King Alfonso V of Aragon (heir presumptive to Aragon)\n\nSent 1,000+ knights to Constantinople\n\nStrong treasury, reformed administration, expanding navy\n\nThe Christian Powers and Their Concerns:\n\nFrance (Charles VII):\n\nLocked in Hundred Years War with England\n\nAngevin claim to Naples threatened by Alfonso V (Juan's ally)\n\nConciliarist sympathies at Basel—Juan supports papal authority\n\nTraditional concern about Iberian consolidation\n\nCurrently distracted but watching\n\nEngland (Henry VI, minority rule):\n\nHundred Years War consuming all resources\n\nSome trade interests in Castile (wool)\n\nUnlikely to act; too distracted\n\nBurgundy (Philip the Good):\n\nWealthy, ambitious, crusade-minded (Order of the Golden Fleece)\n\nCould see Juan as rival for crusade leadership\n\nOr could see him as potential ally\n\nCongress of Arras approaching (September 1435)—major diplomatic shift possible\n\nUnpredictable; could go either way\n\nMilan (Filippo Maria Visconti):\n\nAmbitious, treacherous, opportunistic\n\nConcerned about Alfonso V's Naples expansion\n\nCould see Castilian-Aragonese alliance as threat to northern Italian interests\n\nAlways scheming\n\nVenice:\n\nTrade-focused, pragmatic\n\nConcerned about Ottoman threat (aligns with Juan's Constantinople involvement)\n\nNervous about any power dominating Mediterranean\n\nWatchful but unlikely to act against a Christian crusader\n\nGenoa:\n\nTrade rivals with everyone\n\nCurrently unstable (frequent regime changes)\n\nSome factions aligned with Milan\n\nCould be used as proxy by others\n\nGerman Princes:\n\nFragmented, focused on internal matters\n\nEmperor Sigismund is Juan's ally\n\nUnlikely to act independently\n\nWhat We're Rolling For:\n\nDo any Christian powers take active measures against Juan during 1435? This could range from nothing to diplomatic pressure to covert action to open hostility.\n\nD100 CHAOS TABLE: CHRISTIAN RESPONSE TO CASTILE'S RISE (1435)\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-5\nCOORDINATED COALITION FORMS — France and Milan, alarmed by the emerging Iberian-Papal-Imperial axis, begin secret negotiations for joint action. Burgundy is approached. The goal: isolate Castile diplomatically, support Basel radicals, block Alfonso's Naples succession, and potentially back Granadan exiles or Moroccan intervention. This is not yet war, but the architecture of opposition is being built. Juan will learn of it through intelligence channels—but the threat is real and growing.\n6-12\nFRENCH ACTIVE OPPOSITION — Charles VII, despite his English war, decides Juan's rise cannot be ignored. French diplomats work actively at Basel to revive the radical faction. French gold flows to Italian powers willing to oppose Alfonso in Naples. Letters to Morocco hint at support for reconquest. No military action yet, but France has declared itself—quietly—Juan's enemy. Expect obstruction at every turn.\n13-20\nMILANESE SCHEMING — Filippo Maria Visconti sees opportunity in opposing the Castilian-Aragonese alliance. He cannot act openly, but his agents work to: complicate Alfonso's Naples succession, fund opposition to papal reforms, and cultivate contacts among disgruntled Castilian nobles. Juan may not even know Milan is working against him—but obstacles will appear in unexpected places.\n21-30\nDIPLOMATIC PROBING — Multiple powers send envoys to assess Castile's intentions. France wants to know if Juan threatens their Pyrenean border. Burgundy wants to gauge his crusading ambitions. Venice wants clarity on Mediterranean naval plans. These are not hostile moves, but Juan is being measured. How he handles these conversations will shape future relations. Wrong answers could create enemies; right answers could create friends.\n31-45\nWATCHFUL WAITING — The Christian powers observe but do not act. France is too distracted by England. Burgundy is focused on the Congress of Arras. Milan schemes but commits to nothing. Venice trades and watches. The general sentiment: Juan is rising, but he has not yet threatened anyone directly. Let him exhaust himself in Constantinople while we attend to our own affairs. No help, but no hindrance either.\n46-60\nBENIGN NEGLECT — Europe has larger concerns than Castile. The Hundred Years War. The Council of Basel. The Ottoman threat. Italian rivalries. Juan's rise registers as a minor note in dispatches, not a strategic priority. He is left alone to pursue his projects unmolested—not from friendship, but from indifference. This is a gift; whether Juan recognizes it as such determines whether he uses the time wisely.\n61-70\nCAUTIOUS RESPECT — Juan's achievements—Granada, Constantinople, papal alliance—have earned grudging respect. He is seen as a serious ruler, not a reckless adventurer. Diplomatic correspondence takes on a more respectful tone. Burgundy sends a knight to observe Juan's court. Venice proposes trade negotiations. No alliances offered, but doors are opening that were previously closed.\n71-80\nBURGUNDIAN INTEREST — Duke Philip the Good, ever fascinated by crusading glory, takes particular notice of Juan's Constantinople expedition. Envoys arrive with gifts and questions. Philip hints at coordination—perhaps Burgundian resources could complement Castilian arms? This is exploratory, not committed, but the wealthiest prince in Christendom is paying attention. An opportunity, if carefully cultivated.\n81-88\nFAVORABLE WINDS — The Congress of Arras (September 1435) reshapes European diplomacy. Franco-Burgundian reconciliation leaves England isolated. In this new configuration, Castile's position looks stronger—a potential ally for the emerging Franco-Burgundian understanding, or at least not a target. French hostility softens. The diplomatic environment becomes notably more favorable than Juan had any right to expect.\n89-94\nUNSOLICITED ALLIANCE OFFERS — Juan's reputation as a crusader-king attracts interest from unexpected quarters. A German prince proposes marriage alliance. Burgundy suggests joint crusading ventures. Even France, seeking to balance the new European order, makes tentative friendly overtures. Juan finds himself courted rather than opposed. The challenge becomes choosing among suitors without creating rejected enemies.\n95-100\nPROVIDENTIAL ALIGNMENT — Everything breaks Juan's way. The Congress of Arras creates a new European order that benefits Castile. France, reconciled with Burgundy and preparing final victory over England, sees Juan as a natural partner rather than rival. Burgundy proposes formal crusading alliance. Venice offers favorable trade terms. Even Milan's schemes collapse when Visconti's health fails. By year's end, Castile stands not as a rising threat to be contained, but as a respected power welcomed into the European concert.\n\nPlease roll d100 for Christian powers' response to Castile during 1435.",

No help, but no hindrance either.\n\nThis is a neutral outcome - Juan gets space to operate without active opposition, but also without new friends. A good result for a king who needs time to consolidate.\n\nNow I should narrate Álvaro de Luna's briefing, incorporating this information about the international situation.\n\nWATCHFUL WAITING\n\nThe Alcázar of Toledo\nPrivate Council Chamber\nEarly June 1435\n\nAfter the family reunion—after Catalina has been persuaded to release your leg, after Lucia has satisfied herself that you have returned whole, after Fernando has been convinced you are not a threatening stranger—you find yourself alone with Álvaro de Luna in the small council chamber overlooking the Tagus.\n\nThe Constable looks older than when you left. The grey at his temples has spread, and there are new lines around his eyes. Governing a kingdom while its king campaigns across the Mediterranean has taken its toll.\n\n\"Wine, Your Majesty?\" He pours without waiting for an answer. \"You'll need it.\"\n\nHe settles into the chair opposite you, a sheaf of correspondence at his elbow.\n\n\"The good news first. The kingdom is stable. Tax revenues are flowing. The reforms continue—we're at perhaps fifty percent implementation now on the administrative changes. The treasury holds over five hundred thousand florins, even after funding your Constantinople venture and the various... donations... you've made.\"\n\nHe permits himself a small smile.\n\n\"The Portuguese treaty is proceeding. Dom Fernando de Castro remains in Toledo, working through the details with my people. King Duarte has sent word that he plans to visit in person—spring, he says, with his family. An unprecedented gesture. The maritime union will be formalized then.\"\n\nHe sips his wine.\n\n\"Granada is quiet. The Inquisition mandate you've secured will help with the convert situation—there's been some tension, accusations flying both ways. Having formal authority to sort genuine converts from false professors will calm things. The Dominican establishment you've arranged will help further.\"\n\nÁlvaro sets down his cup, his expression shifting.\n\n\"Now. The broader picture.\"\n\nHe pulls a letter from the pile.\n\n\"Our ambassadors report from across Christendom. France, Burgundy, Milan, Venice—they are all watching you, Your Majesty. Watching and waiting.\"\n\n\"France is consumed by the English war, but they've taken notice of your rise. Their agents at Basel work to keep the radical faction alive, though without much success since Rochetaillée's... conversion.\" He raises an eyebrow—clearly he wants the full story of that later. \"Charles VII has sent no hostile messages, but neither has he sent friendly ones. He watches.\"\n\n\"Burgundy—Duke Philip is focused on the Congress of Arras, which is scheduled for September. The rumors say he's negotiating reconciliation with France, which would reshape everything. Until that's resolved, he has no attention to spare for Castile. But our sources say he's noticed your Constantinople expedition. The man fancies himself a crusader. He may reach out eventually—or he may see you as a rival for that glory.\"\n\n\"Milan's Visconti schemes as always, but commits to nothing. He's more concerned with Alfonso's Naples than with you directly. Venice trades and counts coins and worries about the Ottomans. They see your Constantinople involvement as... potentially useful. No more than that.\"\n\nÁlvaro spreads his hands.\n\n\"The summary, Your Majesty: Europe has decided to let you exhaust yourself. They assume Constantinople will drain your treasury and your knights. They assume Alfonso's Naples succession will create complications. They assume the Ottoman truce will collapse and you'll be drawn into an unwinnable eastern war.\"\n\nA thin smile.\n\n\"They are waiting for you to fail. They do not yet take you seriously enough to oppose you—which means they also do not take you seriously enough to ally with you. You have space to act.

Juan negotiated a truce with the Ottomans and there was supposed to be a follow-up meeting.\n\n4. **Queen Giovanna II of Naples** - Roll 46 indicated she would die by Autumn 1435 (September/October). This will trigger the Naples succession crisis, with Alfonso V as the designated heir (confirmed by papal investiture).\n\n5. **Congress of Arras** - September 1435, this is the historical Franco-Burgundian reconciliation that ended the Anglo-Burgundian alliance.\n\n6. **Basel Council developments** - Ongoing, but Session 21 (June 9, 1435 historically) would address benefice reservations and other reforms.\n\nLet me have Álvaro summarize these for Juan.\n\nÁlvaro nods, pulling a small calendar from among his papers—a habit he developed years ago, tracking the movements of a kingdom.\n\n\"Several matters of significance, Your Majesty.\"\n\nHe counts on his fingers:\n\n\"First: Queen Lucia is due in September. God willing, another healthy child.

Weeks, perhaps. The maritime union will be formalized then. This is... unprecedented. A Portuguese king visiting Castile with his family. The symbolism alone will reshape how Europe sees the Iberian powers.\"\n\n\"Third:\" He pauses. \"Queen Giovanna II of Naples. Our sources say she fades. The physicians give her until autumn—September, October at the latest. When she dies, Alfonso inherits. René of Anjou will protest, France may grumble, but the papal investiture you secured makes Alfonso's claim unassailable. Still, the transition may require... attention.\"\n\n\"Fourth: The Congress of Arras, September. Burgundy and France negotiating. If they reconcile, England stands alone. The entire balance of northern Europe shifts. We have no direct stake, but the ripples will reach us eventually.\"\n\n\"Fifth:\" Álvaro's expression becomes more guarded. \"The Ottoman situation. You signed a truce with Sultan Murad. There was discussion of a meeting—at Tenedos, I believe? To discuss longer-term arrangements? That was scheduled for spring as well, was it not?\"\n\nHe sets down the calendar.\n\n\"So: Portuguese state visit imminent. Lucia's delivery in September. Giovanna's death likely around the same time. Arras reshaping northern Europe. And the Ottoman question hanging over everything.\"\n\nHe raises an eyebrow.\n\n\"A quiet year, Your Majesty.

The reconciliation between France (Charles VII) and Burgundy (Philip the Good)\n2. The Treaty of Arras - Burgundy abandoned its alliance with England\n3. This was a major turning point in the Hundred Years' War, leaving England isolated\n\nKey points:\n- Held in Arras, in the County of Artois (Burgundian territory)\n- August-September 1435\n- Mediated by papal and conciliar representatives\n- England refused to make the concessions France demanded\n- Philip the Good switched sides, ending the Anglo-Burgundian alliance that had dominated France since 1420\n- This eventually led to French victory in the Hundred Years' War\n\nLet me search for more details to make sure I have this right.\n\nÁlvaro pauses, gathering his thoughts. This is the kind of diplomatic complexity he has spent years tracking.\n\n\"Arras,\" he says slowly. \"The Congress of Arras. It may be the most significant diplomatic gathering in Europe this year—and we are not invited.\"\n\nHe rises and moves to a map on the wall, pointing to the Low Countries.\n\n\"You know the shape of the Hundred Years' War. England and France, fighting for generations over the French crown. What changed everything was Burgundy. When Duke John the Fearless was murdered by the Dauphin's men in 1419—on a bridge during peace talks, no less—his son Philip swore vengeance. Burgundy allied with England. Together they crushed France.\"\n\nHis finger traces the territories.\n\n\"The Treaty of Troyes, 1420. The English king would inherit France. The Dauphin—now Charles VII—was disinherited, called a bastard, driven south of the Loire. For fifteen years, Anglo-Burgundian forces have held Paris, Normandy, most of northern France. Charles clings to his rump kingdom. The Maid of Orléans gave him a crown and a miracle, but she burned three years ago and the war grinds on.\"\n\nHe turns back to you.\n\n\"But Philip of Burgundy grows weary. He has his vengeance—France humiliated, the Dauphin's party broken. What more does fighting gain him? England cannot win outright. France cannot be fully conquered. The war bleeds everyone.\"\n\n\"The Congress of Arras is Philip's way out.\"\n\nÁlvaro returns to his seat.\n\n\"Papal mediators, conciliar representatives, diplomats from across Europe—all gathering in September to negotiate peace. The English will attend, hoping to preserve their gains. Charles VII will attend, hoping to recover his kingdom. And Philip...\"\n\nHe spreads his hands.\n\n\"Philip will sell his alliance to the highest bidder. If England offers enough, he stays loyal. If France offers enough—land, apologies, formal penance for the murder of his father—he switches sides.\"\n\n\"Our sources say Charles is prepared to crawl. To publicly condemn the murder. To cede territories. To give Philip everything he needs to abandon England with his honor intact.\"\n\nA grim smile.\n\n\"If Burgundy switches sides, England stands alone. No ally on the continent. Their hold on northern France becomes untenable. Within a decade—perhaps less—France reunifies under Charles VII. The Hundred Years' War ends.\"\n\n\"Why does this matter to Castile?\"\n\nÁlvaro ticks off the points:\n\n\"First: A unified France is a stronger France. They will look outward again. The Pyrenees border. Naples, where their Angevin cousins claim the throne your ally Alfonso is about to inherit. The Mediterranean, where they once had ambitions.\"\n\n\"Second: Burgundy freed from the English war becomes... unpredictable. Philip is wealthy, ambitious, obsessed with crusading glory. He may see your Constantinople venture as inspiration—or as competition.\"\n\n\"Third: England, defeated and humiliated, will turn inward. They will be no factor in European affairs for a generation. This removes a potential counterweight to France.\"\n\n\"Fourth:\" He pauses. \"The Congress will be attended by Church mediators. The Pope's representatives. The Council of Basel's representatives. It is another stage where the papal-conciliar drama plays out. Another place where your alliance with Eugenius either helps or hinders.\"\n\nHe drains his wine.\n\n\"We have no seat at the table, Your Majesty. No direct stake in whether England or France prevails. But the outcome will reshape Christendom. And a reshaped Christendom will have opinions about a Castile that conquered Granada, allied with Rome, and sent knights to Constantinople.\"\n\nOn the Ottoman truce, Álvaro nods.\n\n\"The truce serves us well. Every month of peace is another month to strengthen Constantinople's walls, train defenders, build our fleet. Trade flows—Venetian and Genoese merchants report good profits, which means our merchants share in them.\"\n\n\"But truces end, Your Majesty. Murad agreed to pause, not to stop. When he is ready—when Anatolia is pacified, when his fleet is rebuilt, when he judges the moment right—he will come again.\"\n\n\"The question is whether we will be ready when he does.\"\n\nWhat does Juan say or do?",

      "text": "France in the 15th century was one of the largest and most populous kingdoms in Europe. By the mid-15th century, France had a population of around 12-15 million people (after the devastation of the Black Death and the Hundred Years' War). Castile had perhaps 4-5 million.\n\nIn terms of military capacity:\n\nFrance could theoretically field very large armies. At the height of their power, French kings could summon:\n- The feudal levy (ban and arrière-ban) - theoretically tens of thousands\n- Professional companies and mercenaries\n- The famous compagnies d'ordonnance (established 1445 by Charles VII - but this is 1435, so not yet)\n\nHowever, in 1435, France is still in the midst of the Hundred Years' War and is divided. Charles VII controls only the southern portion of France. His effective military strength is much reduced.\n\nHistorically:\n- At Agincourt (1415), the French fielded perhaps 12,000-36,000 men (estimates vary wildly)\n- At Verneuil (1424), perhaps 15,000-18,000 French\n- The French armies of this period were often in the range of 5,000-20,000 for major campaigns\n\nA unified France at full strength might theoretically raise 50,000-100,000 men through the full feudal levy, but this was almost never achieved in practice. Logistics, time, distance, and political fragmentation made such numbers impossible to concentrate.\n\nFor Castile, 40,000 levies is actually quite substantial. The Military Orders, royal forces, and noble contingents together could field significant armies - Granada was conquered with perhaps 50,000+ men at various points.\n\nÁlvaro would know the general picture: France is larger and richer than Castile, but currently divided and exhausted. A reunified France would be significantly more powerful - potentially able to field larger armies than Castile, especially if they reform their military system (which Charles VII will do in the late 1440s with the compagnies d'ordonnance).\n\nI'll have Álvaro provide a nuanced perspective on the military strengths and limitations of both kingdoms, drawing from his diplomatic and strategic knowledge.\n\nÁlvaro's expression grows thoughtful. This is the kind of question he has spent years considering—the brutal arithmetic of power.\n\n\"France,\" he says slowly, \"is not Castile. The comparison is... complicated.\"\n\nHe pulls the map closer.\n\n\"In raw numbers? A unified France, at full strength, calling the ban and arrière-ban—every man who owes military service to the crown—could theoretically summon eighty thousand men. Perhaps more. Some say one hundred thousand.\"\n\nHe raises a finger.\n\n\"Theoretically. In practice? No French king has ever concentrated such a force. The logistics alone would be impossible. Men must eat. Horses must eat. Roads cannot bear such numbers. And the feudal levy serves only forty days before they have the right to go home.\"\n\n\"What France actually fields in this war...\"\n\nHe shrugs.\n\n\"Charles VII controls perhaps half the kingdom—the poorer half, the south. The north, the richest lands, the great cities—Paris, Rouen, the cloth towns of Flanders—those are in Anglo-Burgundian hands. Charles scrapes together armies of ten thousand, fifteen thousand, sometimes twenty thousand for major campaigns. He relies heavily on mercenary companies—Scots, Lombards, Gascons who fight for pay.\"\n\n\"The English field smaller forces but of higher quality. Their longbowmen are devastating. Burgundy adds wealth and heavy cavalry.\"\n\n\"At Agincourt, twenty years ago, France summoned perhaps twelve to fifteen thousand men against a sick, starving English army of six thousand. France lost catastrophically. Numbers alone mean nothing without discipline, tactics, leadership.\"\n\nÁlvaro leans back.\n\n\"But if Arras succeeds? If Burgundy switches sides and France reunifies?\"\n\nHis voice becomes more serious.\n\n\"Give Charles ten years of peace to reform his armies, to reclaim the rich northern provinces, to rebuild his treasury. A unified France could then field fifty thousand men—real soldiers, not peasants with pitchforks—and sustain them in the field. Their population is three times ours. Their land is richer. Their tax base, once restored, would dwarf Castile's.\"\n\nHe meets your eyes.\n\n\"We can field forty thousand levies, yes. Good men, hardened by the Reconquista. But France is the largest kingdom in Christendom for a reason. If they turn their full attention to us—to the Pyrenees, to Navarre, to supporting Angevin claims in Naples against your ally Alfonso—we would be... tested.\"\n\nA pause.\n\n\"This is why the Congress of Arras matters, Your Majesty. Not because we have a stake in whether England or France wins their ancient quarrel. But because the outcome determines whether France spends the next generation bleeding against England... or whether they turn their eyes elsewhere.\"\n\n\"A France at war with England is a France that ignores us. A France at peace...\"\n\nHe leaves the implication hanging.\n\n\"Is there a reason you ask about French military strength, Your Majesty?\"\n\nWhat does Juan say?",

Controls Burgundy proper, plus the Low Countries (Flanders, Brabant, Holland, etc.), Franche-Comté, and more. The wealthiest prince in Europe.\n\n2. **Duchy of Brittany** - Semi-independent, French-speaking. Duke John V has been playing both sides in the Hundred Years War. Technically owes homage to France but acts independently.\n\n3. **Duchy of Savoy** - Controls the Alpine passes between France and Italy. French-speaking in parts, Italian in others. Duke Amadeus VIII is actually about to become the Antipope Felix V (elected by Basel in 1439). Important strategic position.\n\n4. **County/Duchy of Provence** - This is interesting. In 1435, Provence is ruled by René of Anjou, who is also Duke of Anjou, Duke of Lorraine, and claimant to the Kingdom of Naples (rival to Alfonso V). René is technically a vassal of the French crown but controls his own territories. Provence itself is nominally part of the Holy Roman Empire, not France.\n\n5. **Duchy of Lorraine** - Border territory between France and the Empire. French-speaking but part of the Empire. René of Anjou holds it through his wife.\n\n6. **County of Flanders** - Part of Burgundian holdings now, but historically tied to France and the Empire.\n\n7. **Dauphiné** - This was traditionally independent but was absorbed into the French crown in 1349 when the future Charles V (as Dauphin) inherited it.\n\nSo the main independent French-speaking powers in 1435 are:\n\nBurgundy stands out as the most powerful, with Philip the Good wielding immense political and economic influence. These territories represent critical fracture points in the French political landscape, each with the potential to undermine royal authority and prevent centralized power.\n\nI see Juan's strategic insight clearly: by maintaining these territories' independence or fostering their hostility to the French crown, France can be kept fragmented and strategically vulnerable. Álvaro would recognize how each territory - from Burgundy's wealth to Provence's complex allegiances - contributes to this political chess game.\n\nÁlvaro's eyes sharpen with interest. This is the kind of strategic thinking he has long hoped to see from his king.\n\n\"Now you are thinking like a prince of Europe, Your Majesty.\"\n\nHe pulls the map closer, his finger tracing the borders of France and its neighbors.\n\n\"France is not one thing. It is a patchwork—a crown surrounded by principalities that speak French but guard their independence jealously. The Valois kings have spent centuries trying to absorb them. Some they have swallowed. Others...\"\n\nBurgundy\n\n\"The greatest of them. You know Philip the Good—Duke of Burgundy, Count of Flanders, ruler of the Low Countries. His domains stretch from the Jura mountains to the North Sea. He is richer than the King of France. Richer than most kings anywhere.\"\n\nÁlvaro taps the map.\n\n\"Burgundy proper is technically a French fief—Philip owes homage to Charles VII for it. But the Low Countries—Flanders, Brabant, Holland, Hainaut—those are Imperial fiefs, owing homage to Emperor Sigismund. Philip plays both sides. He is vassal to two crowns and servant to neither.\"\n\n\"If Arras fails—if Philip remains allied to England—France stays divided. But if Philip reconciles with Charles...\" He shakes his head. \"Philip does not become French. He becomes neutral. And a neutral Burgundy that is no longer bleeding for England is a Burgundy that might look elsewhere for glory. Crusade, perhaps. Mediterranean ambitions. Competition with us.\"\n\nBrittany\n\n\"Duke John V. A survivor. He has spent the entire war playing both sides—nominally loyal to France, practically allied with whoever seems to be winning. Brittany has its own language, its own traditions, its own fleet. The Bretons consider themselves Breton first, French never.\"\n\n\"John owes homage to the French crown but acts as an independent prince. If France unifies and grows strong, Brittany will eventually be absorbed—they lack the strength to resist forever. But for now, John guards his independence carefully.\"\n\n\"We have some trade with Brittany. Their ships. Their salt. A marriage alliance there might be worth exploring—though John has been burned by taking sides before. He would need considerable persuading.\"\n\nSavoy\n\nÁlvaro's finger moves to the Alps.\n\n\"Duke Amadeus VIII. An old man now, very pious, very ambitious in his own way. Savoy controls the Alpine passes between France and Italy—whoever holds Savoy controls whether French armies can march into the peninsula.\"\n\n\"Amadeus has stayed neutral in the great wars, profiting from tolls and trade. He has connections everywhere—his daughters have married into half the royal houses of Europe. He is also...\"\n\nÁlvaro pauses, choosing his words.\n\n\"...sympathetic to the Council of Basel. Very sympathetic. There are rumors he has ambitions in that direction. The conciliarists speak well of him. If Basel ever moves against Pope Eugenius—truly moves, electing a rival pope—Amadeus is the name most often whispered.\"\n\n\"For now, Savoy is neutral and profitable. But watch Amadeus. He may yet play a larger role in Church affairs.\"\n\nProvence\n\n\"Ah.\" Álvaro's expression sours. \"Provence. This one matters directly to us, Your Majesty.\"\n\n\"Provence is ruled by René of Anjou. Duke of Anjou, Duke of Lorraine, Count of Provence, and—he would insist—rightful King of Naples.\"\n\nHe lets that hang in the air.\n\n\"René is Charles VII's brother-in-law and closest ally. When Queen Giovanna dies this autumn, Alfonso will claim Naples with papal blessing. René will claim it with French backing. The two claims are irreconcilable.\"\n\n\"Provence itself is nominally part of the Empire, not France—René owes homage to the Emperor for it. But René is French in everything but legal technicality. His cause is France's cause. If France grows strong, René's Naples claim grows strong with it.\"\n\n\"Right now, René lacks the resources to challenge Alfonso directly. He was actually a prisoner of Burgundy until recently—Philip captured him in battle and only released him for an enormous ransom. He is indebted, weakened, unable to act.\"\n\n\"But if Arras succeeds? If France and Burgundy reconcile? René gains French support, Burgundian neutrality, and suddenly Alfonso's Naples looks far less secure.\"\n\nLorraine\n\n\"A small duchy on the border between France and the Empire. French-speaking, but Imperial territory. René of Anjou holds it through his wife. Strategically important—it guards the route from France into Germany.\"\n\n\"Not powerful enough to matter alone, but whoever controls Lorraine influences the balance between France and the Empire.\"\n\nÁlvaro steps back from the map.\n\n\"So. The French-speaking world is divided among: the French crown, Burgundy, Brittany, Savoy, Provence under René, and various smaller lordships. This division has kept France weak for a century. Every time the Valois try to concentrate strength, they must look over their shoulder at vassals who are vassals in name only.\"\n\nHe meets your eyes.\n\n\"You are thinking that this division serves Castile's interests. You are correct. A France surrounded by independent French-speaking princes is a France that can never turn its full strength against us.\"\n\n\"The question is: what can we do to preserve that division? We have no seat at Arras. We have no alliance with Burgundy. Brittany is distant. Savoy is neutral. And Provence...\"\n\nHe shrugs.\n\n\"Provence is our enemy's friend. René will oppose us wherever Alfonso's interests lie.\"\n\n\"What are you considering, Your Majesty?\"\n\nWhat does Juan say?",

Good strategic thinking.\n\nSavoy - controls Alpine passes but indeed has no Mediterranean ports. Savoy is landlocked in terms of sea access. They control the passes between France and Italy but no coastline.\n\nHowever, there's Nice/Monaco area - let me think about this historically. In 1435:\n- Nice was actually part of Savoy! The County of Nice was ceded to Savoy in 1388. So Savoy DOES have a small Mediterranean coastline around Nice.\n- Monaco was technically independent under the Grimaldi family, though often under various protectorates.\n\nSo Álvaro should correct Juan - Savoy actually does have a small Mediterranean port at Nice, which would be strategically useful.\n\nLet me also think about other options:\n- Genoa - independent republic, frequently unstable, sometimes under Milanese influence\n- The Papal States have ports\n- Naples (soon to be Alfonso's) has ports\n\nThe strategic picture: \n- Brittany for Atlantic/Channel access\n- Savoy for Alpine passes AND actually a small Mediterranean port at Nice\n- This could create a way to pressure France from multiple directions\n\nÁlvaro would be impressed by this strategic thinking and provide accurate geographic information.\n\nÁlvaro's eyebrows rise—he is impressed, and makes no effort to hide it.\n\n\"You are thinking of containing France. Alliances on her flanks, ports where Castilian ships might anchor, places where pressure could be applied if needed.\"\n\nHe studies the map more closely.\n\n\"Brittany first. Yes. Duke John V controls the most strategic coastline in northwestern Europe.\"\n\nHis finger traces the Breton peninsula.\n\n\"Brest. Saint-Malo. Nantes. These ports command the approaches to the English Channel and the Bay of Biscay. Any ship sailing from Castile to Flanders, to England, to the Baltic—they pass Breton waters. Brittany could be a friend who shelters our merchants... or an enemy who preys on them.\"\n\n\"An alliance with Brittany would give us a foothold on France's Atlantic flank. If France ever threatened us through the Pyrenees, Breton ports could receive Castilian troops, Castilian gold, Castilian ships. The threat alone might give Paris pause.\"\n\nHe nods slowly.\n\n\"The difficulty is that John V trusts no one. He has survived by playing all sides. He will not commit to Castile unless he sees clear benefit and minimal risk. But it is worth exploring. A trade agreement first, perhaps. Then closer ties.\"\n\n\"As for Savoy...\"\n\nÁlvaro pauses, a small smile forming.\n\n\"Your Majesty, I must correct a misapprehension. Savoy does have a port.\"\n\nHis finger moves to the Mediterranean coast, just east of Provence.\n\n\"Nice. The County of Nice was ceded to Savoy in 1388—nearly fifty years ago. It is a small port, nothing compared to Genoa or Marseille, but it is Savoyard territory with Mediterranean access.\"\n\nHe taps the location.\n\n\"Nice sits perfectly positioned. East of Provence, west of Genoa, with decent anchorage. A Castilian fleet could shelter there. Troops could disembark there. And from Nice, the Alpine passes into Italy—or into France—are within reach.\"\n\n\"If you secured alliance with Savoy, you would have: a Mediterranean port outside French or Italian control, access to the Alpine passes, and a foothold on France's southeastern flank. Combined with Brittany on the northwest...\"\n\nHe draws an imaginary line across France.\n\n\"France would be bracketed. Unable to concentrate against any single threat without exposing herself to another.\"\n\nÁlvaro steps back, folding his arms.\n\n\"But there are complications.\"\n\n\"Duke Amadeus VIII is old, pious, and—as I mentioned—dangerously sympathetic to the Council of Basel. If he were to become entangled in the papal-conciliar dispute on the wrong side, alliance with him could damage your relationship with Eugenius.\"\n\n\"There are also rumors that Amadeus grows weary of worldly affairs. He speaks of retirement, of religious contemplation. His heir, Louis, is capable but less experienced. The succession in Savoy may be... uncertain in the coming years.\"\n\n\"Still, Nice alone makes Savoy worth cultivating. A Savoyard alliance would not threaten anyone directly—Amadeus is too cautious for that—but it would give you options. Ports for your ships. Passes for your armies if ever needed. A friend on France's flank who owes nothing to Paris.\"\n\nHe returns to his seat, mind clearly working.\n\n\"If you pursued both—Brittany and Savoy—you would need to move carefully. Neither duke will want to be seen as joining a coalition against France. They survive by neutrality. The approach must be: trade, friendship, mutual benefit. Defensive arrangements, perhaps. Nothing that looks like encirclement... even if encirclement is precisely what you intend.\"\n\n\"Shall I instruct our ambassadors to begin exploratory conversations, Your Majesty?

Or shall I select based on availability?\"\n\n\"As for terms: trade arrangements are straightforward—reduced tariffs, safe passage for merchants, perhaps a resident consul in each other's ports. The defensive alliance is more delicate. Duke John will want to know: what constitutes 'French aggression'? If France pressures Brittany to pay overdue homage, is that aggression? If French troops cross Breton soil pursuing English raiders, is that aggression?\"\n\n\"The vaguer the terms, the less useful the alliance. The more specific, the more John may hesitate to commit. I suggest we propose mutual consultation in the event of threat, with military assistance if both parties agree the threat is genuine. This gives John an escape if he wishes to avoid involvement, but also gives us a foot in the door.\"\n\nSavoy\n\n\"Savoy requires a different approach. Duke Amadeus is older, more cautious, more focused on spiritual matters than military ones. He will not respond to talk of French threats—Savoy has survived for generations by not threatening anyone.\"\n\n\"I suggest we frame this as: friendship between Christian princes, coordination on matters of mutual interest, and—importantly—shared concern for the peace of Christendom. Amadeus fancies himself a peacemaker. Appeal to that.\"\n\n\"The question of Nice and port access should be raised gently. Perhaps as a commercial matter first—Castilian merchants seeking safe harbor, willingness to pay fair fees. If Amadeus sees profit without risk, he may warm to closer ties.\"\n\nHe taps the quill against his chin.\n\n\"For this mission, I would suggest someone with Church connections. Amadeus respects piety. A Franciscan, perhaps, or a Dominican from the new establishment you've arranged. Someone who can speak of spiritual matters as easily as political ones.\"\n\n\"There is one complication, Your Majesty.\" Álvaro's expression becomes more guarded. \"Amadeus has been... courted... by the Council of Basel. If he believes you are too closely aligned with Pope Eugenius, he may see alliance with Castile as taking sides in the papal-conciliar dispute. We should instruct our envoy to emphasize that Castile seeks Church unity, not factional victory. True enough, and it leaves room for friendship regardless of how Basel unfolds.\"\n\nÁlvaro sets down the quill.\n\n\"Is there anything specific you wish conveyed to either duke? Personal messages? Gifts? And what level of commitment are you prepared to make if they respond favorably? If Duke John asks whether Castile would send ships to defend Breton ports against French aggression, what should our envoy say?\"\n\nWhat does Juan say?",

      "text": "Juan is thinking strategically about the balance of power in Europe. He's concerned about France eventually turning its attention to Castile, and is exploring whether Burgundy could serve as a natural counterweight to France even if they reconcile.\n\nThis is a good question about European power dynamics. Álvaro would have insights on this - the nature of Franco-Burgundian relations, whether their reconciliation would truly make them allies or just remove active hostility.\n\nLet me think about the historical reality:\n\n1. Burgundy and France were rivals even when not at war. The Burgundian dukes had built a state that rivaled France in wealth and prestige.\n\n2. Philip the Good's reconciliation with Charles VII at Arras (1435) ended their military alliance with England, but it didn't make them friends. Philip extracted enormous concessions - the French king had to publicly condemn the murder of Philip's father, cede territories, and essentially humiliate himself.\n\n3. After Arras, Burgundy remained effectively independent. Philip continued to act as a sovereign prince, not a loyal vassal. The tension between Burgundy and France continued until Louis XI finally crushed Charles the Bold in the 1470s.\n\n4. The fundamental issue was that Burgundy was too powerful to be a comfortable vassal and too dependent on French territory to be fully independent. This created inherent tension.\n\n5. Philip the Good was obsessed with crusading glory (hence the Order of the Golden Fleece). He might see Juan's Constantinople venture as competition or as an opportunity for cooperation.\n\nÁlvaro should explain this nuance - that even a reconciled Burgundy would remain a rival to France, and that this rivalry could be useful to Castile. But he should also note the risks - Burgundy might not want to be seen as part of any anti-French coalition.\n\nAlso, Juan mentioned England. Álvaro might comment on whether an English alliance is feasible or wise given England's current state (about to lose the Hundred Years' War if Arras succeeds).\n\nÁlvaro leans back, a thoughtful expression crossing his face. This is the kind of strategic calculation he lives for.\n\n\"Your Majesty asks the essential question. Let me answer it plainly.\"\n\nHe rises and returns to the map, his finger resting on Burgundy's sprawling territories.\n\n\"Burgundy and France are... complicated. They share blood, language, and history. But they are not friends. They have never been friends. And reconciliation at Arras will not make them friends.\"\n\nThe Nature of Franco-Burgundian Rivalry\n\n\"Consider what Philip the Good has built. His grandfather was a younger son of a French king—given Burgundy as an appanage, a consolation prize. Three generations later, the Burgundian dukes are richer than the French crown, command larger armies, rule more prosperous lands.\"\n\nÁlvaro traces the territories.\n\n\"Burgundy proper. Flanders with its cloth trade. Brabant. Holland. Hainaut. Artois. The wealthiest cities in Christendom north of Italy—Bruges, Ghent, Antwerp, Brussels—all fly Philip's banner. His court outshines Paris. His Order of the Golden Fleece rivals any chivalric order in Europe.\"\n\nHe turns to face you.\n\n\"Philip is technically a vassal of the French crown for his French territories. He owes homage. He should bow before Charles VII.\"\n\nA thin smile.\n\n\"He does not bow. He has not bowed for fifteen years. And even if Arras brings reconciliation, he will bow only as a formality—a performance, not a submission. Philip sees himself as Charles's equal. Perhaps his superior.\"\n\nWhat Arras Actually Means\n\n\"If the Congress succeeds, what does Philip gain? He escapes a war that no longer serves him. He receives French territories—perhaps Picardy, the Somme towns. He receives a public apology for his father's murder. He receives respect.\"\n\n\"What does he give up? Only his alliance with England—an alliance that was always a tool, never a friendship. He loses nothing he values.\"\n\nÁlvaro's eyes narrow.\n\n\"But here is the critical point, Your Majesty: Philip does not become French. He becomes neutral. He stops fighting France, but he does not start serving France. The rivalry remains. It simply changes form.\"\n\n\"Today, the rivalry is military—Burgundian knights fighting alongside English archers. Tomorrow, the rivalry becomes economic, political, dynastic. Who dominates the cloth trade? Who influences the smaller principalities? Who holds the balance of power in the Empire? Whose sons marry whose daughters?\"\n\nHe returns to his seat.\n\n\"France and Burgundy reconciled are like two wolves who agree to stop fighting over a carcass—not because they are friends, but because they are tired. Give them time to rest, and they will eye each other again. The carcass is not big enough for both.\"\n\nBurgundy as Counterweight\n\n\"So yes, Your Majesty. Burgundy remains a natural counterweight to France even after Arras. Philip will never allow France to grow so strong that it can compel his obedience rather than request it. A strong France threatens everything he has built.\"\n\n\"This means Burgundy has interests that align with ours—even if Philip would never admit it publicly. He does not want France to dominate Christendom any more than we do.\"\n\nÁlvaro steeples his fingers.\n\n\"The difficulty is that Philip is proud, wealthy, and owes us nothing. He has no reason to seek our friendship. We are distant. We offer him nothing he cannot obtain elsewhere.\"\n\nA pause.\n\n\"Unless...\"\n\nThe Crusading Angle\n\n\"Philip the Good is obsessed with crusade. The Order of the Golden Fleece was founded on crusading ideals. He speaks constantly of recovering Constantinople, of driving back the Turk, of leading Christian knights to glory in the East.\"\n\n\"He speaks. He does not act. He has never sent a single ship, a single knight, a single florin to the eastern frontier.\"\n\nÁlvaro's tone carries a hint of contempt.\n\n\"But he wants to be seen as a crusader. It is essential to his image, to his court's mythology, to the story he tells about himself.\"\n\nHe looks at you intently.\n\n\"You have actually done what Philip only dreams of. You sent a thousand knights to Constantinople. You hold the title Defensor Romaniae. You negotiated with the Ottoman Sultan himself.\"\n\n\"If you approached Philip not as a supplicant seeking alliance against France, but as a fellow crusading prince proposing cooperation in the East... that is a conversation Philip would want to have. It flatters him. It validates his self-image. And it creates a relationship that could prove useful in other ways.\"\n\nThe English Question\n\n\"As for England...\"\n\nÁlvaro's expression grows more cautious.\n\n\"You are right that England on the continent drains French strength. An England with Normandy, with Gascony, with a foothold across the Channel—that is an England that keeps France looking north and west, not south toward us.\"\n\n\"But if Arras succeeds, England loses Burgundian support. Within years—perhaps a decade—they will be driven from France entirely. The Hundred Years' War ends with French victory.\"\n\n\"An alliance with England now would mean allying with the losing side. It would gain us French enmity without English gratitude—because England will have nothing to offer once they lose the continent. They become an island kingdom, licking their wounds, too weak to help us and too proud to admit it.\"\n\nHe shakes his head.\n\n\"If you wish to preserve English power on the continent, the time to act is now, before Arras. But as you say—we have too many commitments. Ottoman matters. Naples. Morocco. The settlement campaign. We cannot fight France's wars for her enemies while also defending Constantinople against the Turk.\"\n\nÁlvaro spreads his hands.\n\n\"My counsel, Your Majesty: let Arras play out. Send your missions to Brittany and Savoy—quiet arrangements, defensive in nature, deniable if needed. Watch Burgundy. If opportunity arises to cultivate Philip through crusading cooperation, take it. But do not reach for too much.\"\n\n\"France will unify eventually. This is... probably inevitable. The question is not whether, but when—and what position Castile holds when it happens.\"\n\n\"Twenty years from now, if France turns south, we want to face them with: a strong treasury, a veteran army, a powerful fleet, alliances on France's flanks, and—God willing—a Constantinople that still stands as proof that Castile defends Christendom.\"\n\n\"Build strength. Cultivate friendships. Avoid unnecessary enemies. And pray that France remains distracted long enough for your children to inherit a kingdom that can meet her as an equal.\"\n\nHe meets your eyes.\n\n\"Is there anything else you wish to discuss regarding the European situation, Your Majesty? Or shall we turn to more immediate matters—the Cortes, the naval expansion, the Moroccan rumors?\"\n\nWhat does Juan say?",

This had been English since Eleanor of Aquitaine married Henry II in the 12th century.\n\nSo the \"southern France\" held by England would primarily be Gascony/Aquitaine - the area around Bordeaux.\n\nIf Castile were to invade Gascony:\n1. It would anger England obviously\n2. It would ALSO anger France - because France claims sovereignty over all of France, including Gascony. The whole point of the Hundred Years' War is that France wants to expel the English and reunify the kingdom under the French crown.\n3. If Castile took Gascony, Castile would be inserting itself into French territory - France would see this as just trading one foreign occupier for another.\n\nÁlvaro should explain this clearly - it's a terrible idea strategically. France doesn't want Castile to \"help\" by taking English lands in France. France wants those lands for FRANCE.\n\nAlso, the idea of declaring war on England to take their French territories would:\n- Create an enemy in England\n- Create an enemy in France (who would see this as Castilian expansion into their territory)\n- Overstretch Castile's already committed resources\n- Potentially draw Burgundy's ire as well\n\nThis is not a good plan and Álvaro should say so diplomatically but firmly.\n\nÁlvaro's eyebrows shoot up.

They are French lands, held by the English crown through ancient inheritance and treaty. Every French king for a century has dreamed of driving the English out and reuniting these territories with the French crown.\"\n\nHe taps Bordeaux.\n\n\"If you were to invade and conquer Gascony, you would not be liberating French territory from the English. You would be replacing one foreign occupier with another. Charles VII would see Castilian banners flying over lands he considers rightfully French—lands his ancestors ruled, lands his subjects inhabit, lands he has bled to recover.\"\n\nÁlvaro shakes his head firmly.\n\n\"France would never forgive it. You would unite France and England against you—a remarkable achievement, given how much they hate each other. Charles would declare that Castile has revealed its true nature: not a defender of Christendom, but a vulture picking at France's wounds.\"\n\nHe steps back from the map.\n\n\"And the rest of Europe would agree. The Pope would be placed in an impossible position—his ally attacking a Christian kingdom without provocation. Burgundy would see Castilian expansion as a threat. Even Aragon might hesitate, fearing what an ambitious Castile might want next.\"\n\nA pause.\n\n\"If you want France weakened, Your Majesty, the path is not conquest. It is ensuring the English hold Gascony as long as possible—bleeding France through endless war, not handing France a cause to unite against us.\"\n\nWhat does Juan say?",
