Let me check the NPC guide as well, and then I can provide the introduction based on the chapter summaries I already read.\n\nFrom the summaries, I know:\n- It's February 1, 1435 (the user says)\n- Juan is in Toledo with his family\n- Queen Lucia (his second wife - Isabel must have died) is there with Fernando (16 months in late 1434), Catalina (nearly 3), and Bianca (newborn - 3 months as of late 1434)\n- Lucia is pregnant again (roll 97 - immediate conception, expected due date would be around September 1435)\n- King Duarte of Portugal visited in early February 1435\n- Major Portuguese Maritime Union has been agreed\n- Tenedos meeting with Sultan Murad II scheduled for Spring 1435\n- Demetrios Komnenos has been assigned as shadow guardian\n- Admiral Vilaragut is handling naval expansion\n- Admiral Ataíde (Portuguese) is coming to Seville\n- Los Caballeros del Defensor being established\n- Treasury is healthy: ~545,000 florins\n- Various economic initiatives underway\n\nLet me read the NPC guide as well.\n\n**Date:** February 1, 1435\n\n**Location:** Toledo, Alcázar\n\n**Recent Events (from Chapter 2.32):**\n- King Duarte of Portugal visited in early February 1435\n- Portuguese Maritime Union framework agreed upon\n- Demetrios Komnenos appointed as shadow guardian for royal family\n- Los Caballeros del Defensor being established\n- Mordecai ben Shlomo recruited for poison detection workshop\n- Physical training progressing well\n- Economic initiatives underway (arms workshops, glass workshop, textile workshop)\n- Naval expansion plan in motion with Admiral Vilaragut\n- Admiral Ataíde (Portuguese) coming to Seville\n\n**Royal Family:**\n- Queen Lucia (second wife - Isabel must have died in Book 1)\n- Princess Catalina (nearly 3) - Isabel's daughter\n- Prince Fernando (now about 18 months - born around September 1433)\n- Princess Bianca (now about 5 months - born September 1434)\n- Lucia is pregnant again (due September 1435)\n\n**Upcoming Events:**\n- Tenedos meeting with Sultan Murad II - Spring 1435\n- Portuguese treaty final signing\n- Admiral Ataíde's arrival in Seville\n- Los Caballeros del Defensor candidates arriving\n- Morocco response expected late April/May\n- Lucia's child due September 1435\n- Queen Giovanna II expected to die by Autumn 1435\n\n**Treasury:** ~545,000 florins (with 200,000 reserved for naval program)\n\nLet me write a short, immersive introduction.\n\nChapter 2.33 — Toledo, February 1, 1435\n\nThe first day of February dawns cold over the Alcázar, frost clinging to the stones of the watchtowers. Winter's grip has softened somewhat since the Portuguese delegation departed three days past, but the wind still carries an edge from the Guadarrama range.\n\nThe royal chambers are warm, at least. Fires burn in every hearth, and the sounds of the household have settled into familiar rhythm: Catalina's imperious chatter as she directs her wooden animals in complex negotiations, Fernando's determined attempts to walk unassisted across the solar, Bianca's feeding cries. Queen Lucia, five months along now, has begun to show—a gentle rounding beneath her winter gowns that she no longer bothers to conceal.\n\nThe visit of King Duarte and Queen Leonor accomplished much. The framework for the Portuguese Maritime Union sits with the scribes, being transformed into formal treaty language. Admiral Ataíde should be en route to Seville even now to coordinate with Vilaragut. The exploration gift—ten thousand florins toward the ventures beyond Cape Bojador—has cemented something beyond mere alliance: genuine family.\n\nBut winter in Toledo also means preparation. The meeting at Tenedos looms perhaps two months hence, and the journey to meet Sultan Murad II will require weeks of travel. The Los Caballeros del Defensor candidates—ten knights of Calatrava selected for shadow warfare training—are expected any day. Commander Martín's intelligence from Morocco remains frustratingly stagnant. And Naples... Queen Giovanna II grows weaker with each passing month, and when she dies, the succession crisis will demand Alfonso's full attention.\n\nDiego de Daza has requested an audience to report on the industrial initiatives. The Junta de Manufacturas has news—German armorsmiths arrived in Bilbao last month, and the secret Venetian glassmaker in Burgos has begun training his first apprentices. Álvaro de Luna has administrative matters requiring the royal seal. The Archbishop wishes to discuss the Dominican initiative and preparations for the Inquisition petition.\n\nThe kingdom does not pause because its king has won a war and made a treaty. It simply expects more.\n\nCurrent Outstanding Matters:\n\nTenedos Meeting — Spring 1435 with Sultan Murad II\n\nPortuguese Treaty — Final documents for signing\n\nAdmiral Ataíde — Integration with Vilaragut in Seville\n\nLos Caballeros del Defensor — Candidates expected imminently\n\nDominican Initiative — Rome visit, major donation still pending\n\nMorocco Intelligence — Stagnation; response expected late April/May\n\nPapal Petition — Inquisition mandate, Military Orders charter\n\nNaples Succession — Giovanna's death expected by autumn\n\nTreasury: ~545,000 florins (200,000 reserved for naval expansion)\n\nWhat matters does Your Majesty wish to address this morning?",

These are ten knights from the Order of Calatrava selected for shadow warfare training under Demetrios Komnenos. They're arriving at the Alcázar.\n\nI should describe their arrival and then stop for Juan to interact with them.\n\nChapter 2.33 — Toledo, February 1, 1435\n\nCorrections noted: The Portuguese Maritime Treaty was signed before King Duarte's departure. Treasury stands at approximately 545,000 florins with naval expansion integrated into regular budgeting. Queen Lucia is three months along, the gentle curve of early pregnancy just beginning to show.\n\nThe messenger arrives mid-morning, while Juan reviews correspondence in the smaller council chamber. A young page, breathless from the stairs.\n\n\"Your Majesty—riders approach from the south. Ten knights bearing the cross of Calatrava. The gate captain asks if they should be admitted to the Alcázar directly.\"\n\nThe Los Caballeros del Defensor. Don García López de Padilla, Master of Calatrava, has selected his ten from among the Order's most capable—men who have proven themselves in the Granada campaign, who possess the temperament for work that goes beyond the battlefield.\n\nDemetrios Komnenos materializes from wherever he watches. The Greek's face betrays nothing, but there is a certain alertness in his posture—professional interest in the raw material he will be expected to shape.\n\n\"Shall I observe their arrival, Your Majesty?\" His voice is quiet, measured. \"How a man dismounts, how he enters an unfamiliar space, where his eyes go first—these things tell much.\"\n\nWithin the hour, the ten knights stand assembled in the Alcázar's smaller audience chamber. They wear traveling clothes rather than full armor—practical wool and leather, swords at their hips, the red cross of Calatrava on their breasts. Road dust still clings to their boots. They range in age from perhaps twenty-five to forty, and they stand with the discipline of men who have spent years under monastic military rule.\n\nOne steps forward—the eldest, a weathered man with gray threading his dark beard and a scar running along his jaw. He kneels.\n\n\"Your Majesty. I am Brother Rodrigo de Arévalo, senior among those Master García has sent. We come as commanded, to serve in whatever capacity the Crown requires.\" He pauses, and something complicated passes across his face. \"The Master told us only that we would receive special training for the protection of the realm. He said the nature of our duties would be... unusual.\"\n\nThe other nine kneel behind him, silent, waiting.",

No king would have to fear as much for a knife in his back or for his children to be poisoned. But as we enter the east and fight the Ottomans, we will. And we must adapt.\n\n\nI have trained to be a good fighter. To defend myself and my family. But that is no longer sufficient. A man with no morals and a conviction can enter my palace and if he is a competent fighter could kill members of the royal family in many ways. A crossbow bolt from an unobserved location. A knife when the queen visits the market. One unattended moment when Fernando is not guarded. And if the assasin does not care for his own safety and only cares for his mission, how can we defend ourselves?\n\n\nDemetrios, you have accepted this charge and today you recieve reinforcement.

He would assess the knights as he speaks.\n\nLet me write his response in character - direct, practical, perhaps a bit grim about the realities of shadow warfare.\n\nThe knights rise as commanded, exchanging glances. This is not the speech they expected—talk of poison and assassins, of enemies who care nothing for honor or their own lives. Brother Rodrigo's jaw tightens slightly, but he holds his tongue.\n\nDemetrios steps forward. He moves without sound, a fact that several of the knights notice with visible unease. When he speaks, his Castilian carries the faint music of Greek beneath it.\n\n\"A normal guard stands at a door.\" His dark eyes move across the ten men, assessing. \"He watches for threats that announce themselves—drawn swords, hostile approaches, men who look dangerous. He reacts to what he sees.\"\n\nHe begins to pace slowly before them, hands clasped behind his back.\n\n\"I watch the servant who has worked in the kitchens for fifteen years and whose daughter was just married to a man with gambling debts. I watch the mason repairing the wall who lingers too long near the royal apartments. I watch the merchant who gave the Queen a gift of Venetian glass and asked nothing in return.\" A pause. \"I watch you, right now, and I see which of you touched your sword hilt when I moved—which of you tracked my hands—which of you looked to your brothers first.\"\n\nHe stops before Brother Rodrigo.\n\n\"A guard defends a position. What I do—what you will learn to do—is deny the enemy his opportunity before he knows we have seen him. The assassin who reaches the Queen's chamber has already succeeded, even if he dies there. Our work is finished long before that moment, or it has failed.\"\n\nHe turns back to address them all.\n\n\"You are knights. You have been taught that combat is honest—blade against blade, skill against skill, with honor preserved on both sides.\" His voice carries no judgment, only statement of fact. \"That training will not protect the King's children from a wet nurse paid to smother them in their sleep. It will not stop the poisoned communion wafer. It will not prevent the crossbow bolt from a window across the plaza.\"\n\nHe lets the silence stretch.\n\n\"What I look for in you is this: Can you see the world as the enemy sees it? Can you walk through a room and know, without thinking, every place a man might hide, every object that might conceal a blade, every servant whose loyalty has not been tested? Can you suspect everyone while trusting those who have earned it? Can you do work that no song will celebrate, that your brothers in Calatrava will never know of, that may stain your soul in ways the confessional cannot fully cleanse?\"\n\nHis gaze is steady, almost gentle.\n\n\"Some of you will find you cannot. There is no shame in this. A man who cannot do this work honestly is more valuable than one who does it badly. But those who remain...\" He glances toward Juan. \"Those who remain will become something new. Not guards. Not soldiers. Shadows that keep other shadows at bay.\"\n\nBrother Rodrigo speaks, his voice careful. \"You speak of suspecting everyone. Watching servants, merchants, even—\" He stops himself.\n\n\"Even priests. Even nobles. Even fellow knights.\" Demetrios completes the thought without flinching. \"Yes.\"\n\nThe ten men stand in heavy silence. This is not what they trained for in Calatrava's austere commanderies. This is something else entirely.",

When I was in Constantinople, I entered a world I was not prepared for. I had to hide my family on board of my ship for fear of their life. My guard did what they could, but like Demetrios said, a guard fights what he faces. Triple guard always and always be alert was the best what we could do. The sultan has dedicated guards who think like assasins, as does the emperor. If someone kills me or even wounds me, most that I have built will not survive.",

He's being honest about the stakes - that if he is killed or wounded, his work may not survive.\n\nThis is a moment for the knights to react. Some may be moved by his honesty. Some may be troubled by this departure from traditional knightly virtue. Some may see the wisdom in it.\n\nI should have the knights react authentically. Brother Rodrigo seems to be the senior and most thoughtful among them. Others may have different reactions.\n\nLet me write a response that:\n1. Shows the knights processing this unusual mission\n2. Has them respond authentically - not immediately enthusiastic, but thoughtful\n3. Perhaps has one or two voice concerns or questions\n4. Stops to let Juan respond if there's a question directed at him\n\nI should keep this relatively short since we're in dialogue mode.\n\nThe words land heavily among the ten. Juan sees it in their faces—the shift from abstract duty to concrete understanding. This is not ceremony. Their king stood in Constantinople and feared for his family's lives, and the best his guard could offer was more vigilance.\n\nBrother Rodrigo's expression has changed. The wariness remains, but beneath it something else stirs—the recognition of a problem that his training cannot solve.\n\nA younger knight speaks—perhaps thirty, with the lean build of a man more suited to speed than strength. \"Your Majesty, I am Brother Álvaro de Montoya. I served at Málaga, in the coastal raids before the siege.\" He hesitates, then continues. \"We lost Commander Diego to a fisherman. A fisherman. He had gutted fish for the garrison for weeks. No one thought to watch him. He used his own knife.\"\n\nSilence.\n\n\"I have wondered since then,\" Brother Álvaro continues quietly, \"how we could have seen it. What we missed. The Commander was a good man, and he died because none of us thought to suspect a man who smelled of fish and bowed when we passed.\"\n\nAnother knight—older, heavyset, with the scarred knuckles of a man who has fought often and hard—shifts his weight. \"Brother Álvaro speaks of seeing threats. But this work you describe...\" He addresses Demetrios rather than Juan, soldier to soldier. \"It sounds less like guarding and more like... hunting. Learning to think as the enemy thinks.\" He frowns. \"Can a man do such work and remain... himself?\"\n\nDemetrios regards him steadily, but does not answer immediately. The question hangs in the cold air of the chamber.",

This should be honest and somewhat sobering, but not so dark that it discourages the knights entirely. It should help answer the question the older knight asked: \"Can a man do such work and remain himself?\"\n\nThis is a dialogue scene, so I should keep it relatively short - let Demetrios speak, then stop to let Juan respond or ask follow-up questions.\n\nDemetrios is quiet for a long moment. When he speaks, his voice has shifted—still measured, but with something beneath it. Memory, perhaps.\n\n\"I served the Council of Ten for twenty years. I began at twenty-three, a sailor's son from Crete with quick hands and a talent for noticing things others missed.\" He does not look at the knights as he speaks, but somewhere past them. \"There were perhaps thirty of us in the corps I joined. Men who protected Venice's interests—her ambassadors, her merchants, her secrets.\"\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\"Of those thirty, I can tell you what became of each. Seven died in service—four by blade, two by poison, one by a fall that was not a fall. Five were broken by the work. Not their bodies—their minds. They saw threats everywhere, trusted no one, could not sleep without a knife in hand. The Council pensioned them quietly to monasteries or distant estates.\"\n\nHis gaze returns to the room.\n\n\"Eight left the service while they still could. They felt themselves changing and chose to stop. Some became merchants. One took holy orders. They live, but they do not speak of those years.\"\n\nHe holds up his hand, counting.\n\n\"That leaves ten who served a full career and emerged... intact. Myself among them.\" A ghost of something—not quite a smile—crosses his weathered face. \"We are not the same men we were. But we are still men. We can love, pray, laugh. We have not become the monsters we hunted.\"\n\nHe looks directly at the knight who asked the question.\n\n\"The difference? We never forgot why we did the work. Not for gold. Not for the thrill of it. Not because we enjoyed suspicion. But because somewhere, a family slept safely because we did not.\"",

He's framed the work not as dishonorable but as a new kind of fighting against a new kind of threat. He's emphasized his own willingness to be on the front line and his personal stake - his family's safety.\n\nNow the knights need to respond. Let me think about how they would react:\n\n1. Brother Rodrigo de Arévalo - the senior knight, weathered, scarred jaw. He's been quiet, processing. He's probably the most experienced and thoughtful.\n\n2. Brother Álvaro de Montoya - already showed understanding through his story about Commander Diego and the fisherman. He seems receptive.\n\n3. The older, heavyset knight with scarred knuckles who asked about remaining \"himself\" - he got an answer from Demetrios. He's probably still processing.\n\nThe knights are Calatrava men - monastic warriors, sworn to fight Muslims. Juan has framed this as exactly that - another form of fighting the same enemy. This is smart framing.\n\nBut they're also knights raised on honor and direct combat. This is asking them to become something different. Some will embrace it, some may struggle.\n\nI should show a range of reactions. The senior knight should speak for the group. Perhaps one or two others add their voices. They shouldn't all immediately agree with enthusiasm (that would be unrealistic), but they also shouldn't be hostile - they were selected by their Master for this, they've heard compelling arguments, and their king has personally asked them.\n\nLet me write the knights' response, showing their acceptance of the charge while acknowledging the weight of what's being asked. Then perhaps Demetrios can outline next steps or ask something of them.\n\nI should stop after the NPCs speak to let Juan respond.\n\nThe chamber is silent save for the distant sound of wind against the windows. The ten knights stand straighter now—not the rigid formality of ceremony, but something more genuine. A decision forming.\n\nBrother Rodrigo looks to his fellows. Something passes between them—the wordless communication of men who have trained and fought together. Slight nods. One knight—young, barely twenty-five, with the earnest face of a true believer—crosses himself.\n\nThen Brother Rodrigo steps forward and kneels again, unbidden.\n\n\"Your Majesty. I have served Calatrava for eighteen years. I took vows to defend Christendom against its enemies. I thought I understood what that meant.\" He looks up, meeting Juan's eyes. \"I did not. The enemy has changed, and we must change with him.\"\n\nHe draws his sword—slowly, deliberately, so that Demetrios does not mistake the gesture—and lays it on the stones before Juan's feet.\n\n\"I cannot speak for my brothers. Each man must choose this path with open eyes. But I will learn this shadow work. Not because I desire it, but because—\" He pauses, and when he speaks again, his voice is rougher. \"Because I have a nephew. He is seven years old. He thinks knights are heroes from songs. If learning to think like an assassin means that boy grows up in a kingdom where his king's children are safe... then I will carry that weight.\"\n\nOne by one, the others kneel. Brother Álvaro. The heavyset knight with scarred knuckles. The young believer who crossed himself. All ten, swords laid before them.\n\nBrother Álvaro speaks quietly. \"The fisherman who killed Commander Diego—he succeeded because we could not imagine a fisherman as a threat. You are asking us to imagine everything as a threat, so that nothing surprises us.\" He inclines his head. \"It is harder than charging a fortified position. But perhaps more necessary.\"\n\nDemetrios watches with an expression that might, in another man, be called satisfaction. He turns to Juan.\n\n\"With Your Majesty's permission—I would begin their assessment today. Not training. Not yet. First I must see how each man sees. How he moves. What he notices and what he misses.\" His eyes move across the kneeling knights. \"Some will excel at protection. Others at observation. Others at the work that requires... conversation and patience.

Then stop for Juan to continue or for the scene to develop naturally.\n\nTomás's head rises slightly at the introduction—surprise flickering across his features before he masters it. To be named before knights of Calatrava, to have his skill acknowledged as essential to the King's protection... this is not the life he imagined when he was sorting spices in his father's kitchen in Córdoba.\n\nThe knights absorb this information with varying degrees of composure. The heavyset knight with scarred knuckles—Brother Gonzalo, his name—frowns slightly, not with contempt but with the practical concern of a soldier. \"The antidote, Your Majesty—there are many poisons. Surely no single remedy can counter all of them?\"\n\nDemetrios answers before Juan can speak. \"There is no single antidote. But there are preparations that slow many poisons, that buy time for treatment. And Mordecai—\" He catches himself, glancing at Juan for permission to continue.\n\nTomás speaks, his voice quiet but steady. \"Your Majesty, if I may—\" He waits for acknowledgment before continuing. \"I cannot taste everything. Some poisons work through the skin, through oils on a cup's rim or a napkin's cloth. Others take hours to show effect, long after the meal is finished. But I can detect much. And I am learning more.\"\n\nHe hesitates, then adds: \"I am not a warrior. I cannot protect you as these brothers can. But I can tell you when the wine smells faintly of almonds when it should not. When meat has been touched by hands that handled certain plants. This is what I offer.\"",

Stop and let him decide what happens next\n\nI shouldn't generate any dialogue or actions for Juan. I should stop at natural decision points.\n\nFor the timeline: It's February 1, 1435. A few weeks of preparation would bring us to late February. Then travel to Barcelona - that would take maybe a week or more overland. So perhaps early March arrival in Barcelona? The meeting is \"Spring 1435\" - so March/April makes sense for Tenedos.\n\nLet me write a passage covering the weeks, then pause at a natural point.\n\nDemetrios bows. \"Your Majesty.\" He turns to the knights and Tomás, his voice shifting to something harder, more demanding. \"With me. All of you. We begin now.\"\n\nThe eleven men file out—ten knights of Calatrava and one servant's son from Córdoba, bound together in purpose if not yet in understanding. Brother Rodrigo pauses at the threshold, looking back at Juan with an expression that mingles gratitude and gravity. Then he is gone.\n\nThe Weeks Pass\n\nFebruary unfolds in a rhythm of preparation and precious domesticity.\n\nThe mornings belong to the realm—councils with Álvaro de Luna, correspondence with Alfonso regarding Naples, final details of the Portuguese treaty now being copied by scribes in both Toledo and Lisbon. Diego de Daza reports on the industrial initiatives: the German armorsmiths in Bilbao have begun producing their first samples, quality far exceeding Castilian work. The Venetian glassmaker in Burgos remains a closely guarded secret, his workshop disguised as a simple merchant's warehouse.\n\nThe afternoons, when possible, belong to family. Lucia grows more radiant as her pregnancy advances into its fourth month—the sickness of the early weeks has passed, replaced by a gentle energy. Catalina, now thoroughly convinced that Demetrios is her personal knight despite his fearsome reputation, presents him daily with new objects to \"guard.\" Fernando has mastered walking and deploys this skill primarily to chase the palace cats. Bianca, at five months, has discovered laughter.\n\nSome evenings, Juan observes Demetrios's training from the gallery above the practice yard. It is nothing like what the knights expected. No swordplay. No formations. Instead, Demetrios walks them through the Alcázar blindfolded, demanding they count doors and windows from memory. He seats them at tables and asks what the servant who poured their wine was wearing. He sends Tomás to hide objects in rooms and times how long each knight takes to find them.\n\nThree of the knights excel. Brother Álvaro, who lost his commander to a fisherman's knife, possesses an almost preternatural awareness of hands and small movements. A quiet knight named Brother Sebastián, who has barely spoken since arriving, notices inconsistencies that others miss entirely—a door left slightly more ajar than before, dust disturbed on a windowsill. And Brother Rodrigo, the eldest, demonstrates a gift for reading faces, for knowing when a man's smile does not reach his eyes.\n\nThe others progress more slowly, but none fail entirely. Demetrios works them hard, and they do not complain.\n\nLate February, 1435\n\nThe day of departure arrives under gray skies. The household gathers in the private courtyard—Lucia wrapped in furs against the morning chill, Catalina clutching her wooden horse Hidalgo, Fernando squirming in his nurse's arms, Bianca asleep against Lucia's shoulder.\n\nThe escort is assembled: fifty royal guards under Captain Fernán, six of the newly-trained Caballeros del Defensor (the other four remaining to protect the family under Demetrios's continued instruction), and Tomás de Córdoba with his leather satchel of preparations and antidotes.\n\nDemetrios himself stands apart, watching. He will not accompany Juan to Tenedos—his place is here, guarding what matters most. But three of his best students will go in his stead.\n\nThe horses stamp impatiently. The road to Barcelona awaits, and beyond it, the sea, and beyond that, a meeting that may determine whether Juan's vision of Christian empire lives or dies.\n\nLucia steps forward, Bianca still cradled against her. Her eyes are steady, though Juan knows what this farewell costs her.",

The knights are already disciplined military men - they know how to follow orders and train hard\n3. They are motivated - Juan's speech was compelling and they understand the stakes\n4. They volunteered/were selected as the best candidates from Calatrava\n5. A few weeks is short but intensive training can establish fundamentals\n6. Tomás is already trained and doesn't need as much work\n7. Brother Álvaro already has the right mindset (learned from the fisherman incident)\n\n**Failure Factors:**\n1. A few weeks is extremely short for this kind of mental reorientation\n2. These are men trained in honor-based combat - the mental shift is significant\n3. Some may struggle with the suspicious mindset required\n4. The work may conflict with their religious/monastic values in ways that cause friction\n5. Demetrios is new to them - trust takes time to build\n6. They're learning from scratch - no foundation in this kind of work\n7. Some may simply not have the aptitude despite willingness\n\n**What we're rolling for:**\n- How many knights show real aptitude\n- How well the group bonds and functions as a unit\n- Whether any problems emerge (value conflicts, personality clashes, inability to adapt)\n- How prepared they are to actually protect Juan at Tenedos\n\nLet me create a table that reflects genuine uncertainty:\n\n**1-10: Serious Problems**\nTraining reveals fundamental incompatibilities. Several knights cannot adapt to the suspicious mindset or have value conflicts that make them liabilities. Demetrios recommends against taking more than 2-3 to Tenedos.\n \nThe mental transformation proves challenging. Most knights struggle to break free from traditional guard mentalities. Only a handful demonstrate potential for covert operations, with significant reservations about their readiness for complex shadow work.\n\nGradual improvement emerges. Several knights begin showing promise, developing more nuanced observational skills. Demetrios recognizes the potential for a specialized unit, though progress remains uneven and fragile.\n\nA turning point arrives. 5 knights now display genuine aptitude for the intricate work. The remaining members are making initial mental shifts, creating the foundations of a cohesive protection team. Specializations start to crystallize, hinting at the unit's future capabilities.\n\nTraining Assessment — Los Caballeros del Defensor\n\nDemetrios has a few weeks to assess and begin training ten Calatrava knights in shadow warfare. This is an extremely short timeframe for work that normally takes months or years.\n\nSuccess Factors:\n\nDemetrios is exceptionally skilled (20 years with Council of Ten)\n\nKnights are already disciplined, accustomed to rigorous training\n\nStrong motivation after Juan's speech and understanding of stakes\n\nPre-selected as Calatrava's best candidates by Master García\n\nBrother Álvaro already has the right mindset (fisherman incident)\n\nTomás already trained; integration rather than instruction\n\nFailure Factors:\n\nA few weeks is desperately short for this mental reorientation\n\nKnights trained in honor-based combat; the shift is profound\n\nSuspicious mindset may conflict with religious/monastic values\n\nDemetrios is unknown to them; trust takes time\n\nNo foundation in observational/shadow work\n\nSome may simply lack aptitude despite willingness\n\nD100 Table: Training Results\n\nRoll\nResult\n1-10\nSerious Problems — Training reveals fundamental incompatibilities. Several knights cannot adapt or have value conflicts making them liabilities. Demetrios recommends only 2-3 for Tenedos.\n11-25\nDisappointing Progress — The mental shift proves harder than expected. Most revert to guard-thinking under pressure. Only 1-2 show real aptitude. Unit lacks cohesion.\n26-40\nMixed Results — 3-4 knights show genuine promise; the rest still think like traditional guards. Functional but fragile.\n41-60\nSolid Foundation — Reasonable progress. 4-5 demonstrate real aptitude. Others have begun the shift but need more time. A working unit is forming.\n61-75\nStrong Progress — 5-6 knights developing the shadow mindset effectively. Clear specializations emerging. Beginning to function as cohesive protection team.\n76-90\nExcellent Results — 7-8 show strong aptitude, several with natural gifts that surprise even Demetrios. Genuine brotherhood forming.\n91-99\nExceptional Transformation — Nearly all show real promise. 2-3 emerging as potentially exceptional. Calatrava discipline meshes remarkably well with shadow training.\n100\nLightning in a Bottle — Every knight proves to have exactly the right temperament. Unit bonds into something formidable in record time.\n\nShall I roll?",
