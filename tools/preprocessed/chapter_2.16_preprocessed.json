      "text": "I found Chapter 2.13. Let me now search specifically for Chapter 2.14 and 2.15 to understand where we are now.\n\nNo Chapter 2.14 yet. Let me check the project files listing to see what files are available.\n\nGood. Chapter 2.15 exists. Let me read both Chapter 2.14 and Chapter 2.15 summaries to understand where we are in the story.\n\nThe files are in the project directory but I need to read them via the view tool from the project's /mnt/project path.\n\nI now have a clear understanding of where we are in the story. This is Chapter 2.16, and we are in the middle of Juan's visit to Barcelona in mid-January 1434. The user said \"we are about to go to our next appointment.\"\n\nLooking at the Outstanding Matters from Chapter 2.15:\n1. **María** – Juan must speak with her again before sailing\n2. **Lucia speaking with María** – May help bridge the gap\n3. **Don Ramon de Perellós** – Awaiting audience on court administration and visit itinerary\n4. **Consell de Cent** – Midday reception with city council and merchant guilds\n5. **Count of Pallars** – Private afternoon audience requested\n6. **Don Guillem de Vic** – Wants to report on drafted communications\n7. **Bishop's Mass** – Tomorrow morning at hour of Terce, Cathedral of Santa Eulàlia\n8. **Constantinople Expedition** – Fleet and knights ready, departure approaching\n\nThe morning of Day 12 has already happened:\n- Reconciliation with Lucia\n- Painful meeting with María\n- Successful meeting with Bishop\n\nBased on the timeline, the next items on the agenda would be:\n- Don Ramon de Perellós (awaiting audience on court administration and visit itinerary)\n- Then midday: Consell de Cent (city council and merchant guilds)\n- Then afternoon: Count of Pallars\n\nLet me set up the scene for the next appointment. Don Ramon de Perellós seems to be the next logical meeting, as he's the head of the regency council and was described as \"awaiting audience.\"\n\nLet me also make sure I understand who Don Ramon de Perellós is from the Chapter 2.15 summary - he's the head of the regency council for Aragon, and he privately briefed Juan about the two factions. So Juan has already met him briefly. Now Juan would be having a more formal audience.\n\nWait - let me re-read the timeline more carefully. \n\nI see we're still on Day 12, following the morning's events with the Bishop. Don Ramon de Perellós is the next scheduled meeting, waiting to discuss court administration and the visit's itinerary. This follows the established sequence of appointments for the day, with the formal audience providing an opportunity to delve deeper into the political landscape of Aragon.\n\nNow I have the full picture. We're in Barcelona, mid-January 1434, on Day 12 of your visit. This morning you reconciled with Lucia, had a painful but open-ended conversation with María, and had a transformative meeting with Bishop Francesc Climent Sapera.\n\nAccording to the schedule, your next appointment is with Don Ramon de Perellós, head of the regency council, who is awaiting audience on court administration and the itinerary for the remainder of your Barcelona visit.\n\nThe morning sun has climbed higher over Barcelona by the time you emerge from the bishop's study. The bells of Santa Eulàlia toll the end of Terce somewhere behind you, their bronze voices echoing through the narrow streets of the Barri Gòtic.\n\nCaptain Robles falls into step beside you as you cross the cloister garden. \"Your Majesty, Don Ramon de Perellós awaits in the regent's council chamber. He sent word asking whether you wished him to attend you here, or if you preferred to meet in the Palau Reial.\"\n\nThe walk back to the palace would take perhaps a quarter hour through the winding streets. The morning air is crisp but not cold—mild for January, even by Mediterranean standards.\n\nLucia remained at the palace with Catalina after your departure for the bishop's meeting. The Consell de Cent, Barcelona's powerful city council and merchant guilds, expects you at midday. The Count of Pallars has requested a private audience for the afternoon.\n\nThere is much still to accomplish before the fleet sails.\n\nWhat does Juan do?",

      "text": "**Don Ramon de Perellós** - Head of the regency council for Aragon while Alfonso V is in Naples.\n\nWhat does this NPC want?\n- He wants to maintain his own power and position in the regency\n- He wants to manage Juan carefully - Juan is powerful, popular, and potentially disruptive to the delicate balance he's maintained\n- He wants to understand Juan's true intentions regarding Aragon - is Juan here to help, or to eventually absorb/dominate?\n- He wants to ensure the regency council's authority isn't undermined by Juan's direct relationships with faction leaders\n- He's probably nervous that Juan went directly to faction leaders (Pallars, Guillem) and the bishop without consulting him first\n- He wants to control the itinerary and manage Juan's access to key people\n\nWhat won't he say?\n- He won't say he's worried about his own position\n- He won't say he's uncomfortable with how Juan is building direct relationships that bypass the regency council\n- He won't say he's uncertain whether Juan's \"family unity\" rhetoric is genuine or a prelude to Castilian dominance\n- He won't reveal his own assessment of which faction he privately favors (he has to appear neutral as head of the regency)\n- He won't admit that María has confided in him about her concerns regarding Juan\n\nLet me also think about what the chapter summary tells us:\n- Don Ramon privately briefed Juan on the two factions (Aragonese vs Neapolitan) at the reception\n- He's described as head of the regency council\n- He's awaiting audience on \"court administration and visit itinerary\"\n\nSo he's probably going to:\n1. Try to control Juan's schedule and access\n2. Probe what Juan discussed with the bishop (church matters are politically sensitive)\n3. Try to understand what Juan offered to faction leaders\n\n4. Subtly remind Juan that the regency council is the proper channel for dealings with Aragon\n5. Present administrative matters that serve his own agenda\n\nHe'll strategically navigate the conversation, using bureaucratic protocol to subtly assert the council's authority. His approach will be measured and diplomatic, seeking to understand Juan's motives while protecting the regency's interests. The interaction will be a delicate dance of political maneuvering, with Don Ramon carefully probing and positioning himself to maintain control.\n\nNPC Analysis - Don Ramon de Perellós:\n\nWhat he wants: To control Juan's access and schedule; to reassert the regency council as the proper channel for all dealings with Aragon; to understand what Juan has been promising to people without going through him first.\n\nWhat he won't say: That Juan's direct conversations with faction leaders and the bishop have already undermined his position; that María has spoken to him about their difficult meeting; that he fears Juan's \"family\" rhetoric is cover for Castilian absorption.\n\nThe walk through the Barri Gòtic is pleasant despite the weight of the morning's conversations. Lucia walks beside you, her hand resting lightly on your arm. She says little, but her presence is steady.\n\nThe Palau Reial rises at the heart of the old city—less imposing than Toledo's Alcázar, but older, its stones worn smooth by centuries of Catalan counts and Aragonese kings. The guards at the gate snap to attention as you approach, and a steward appears almost immediately to escort you through the courtyard.\n\nDon Ramon de Perellós receives you in the regent's council chamber—a long room dominated by a heavy oak table and tapestries depicting the conquest of Majorca. He rises from behind a desk cluttered with documents, bowing precisely.\n\n\"Your Majesty. Your Majesty.\" The second bow, shallower, to Lucia. \"I trust the morning has been productive.\"\n\nHis face is carefully pleasant. He is perhaps sixty, grey-bearded, with the watchful eyes of a man who has survived four years of managing competing factions while the actual king fights wars in Italy.\n\n\"I have prepared a proposed itinerary for Your Majesty's remaining time in Barcelona.\" He gestures to a document on the desk. \"The Consell de Cent at midday, as arranged. The Count of Pallars has requested a private audience—I have suggested the fourth hour after noon, if that suits. Don Guillem de Vic wishes to present certain communications he has drafted on Your Majesty's behalf.\"\n\nHe pauses, straightening a stack of papers that did not need straightening.\n\n\"I understand Your Majesty visited Bishop Climent Sapera this morning. A lengthy meeting, by all accounts.\"\n\nThe observation hangs in the air—not quite a question, not quite an accusation.",

      "text": "**What does Don Ramon want?**\n1. To control access to the regency - he's the head of the regency council and Juan has been going around him\n2. To understand what Juan's promises mean for Aragon's future - he's worried about Castilian absorption\n3. To protect his own position - if Juan and María work things out, or if Alfonso returns, where does that leave him?\n4. To assert that proper channels matter - Juan's been making deals directly with faction leaders and clergy without going through him\n\n**What won't he say?**\n1. That María has spoken to him about their difficult conversation\n2. That he's worried Juan's \"family\" rhetoric is cover for Castilian dominance\n3. That he fears becoming irrelevant if Juan builds direct relationships with everyone\n4. That the bishop's meeting concerns him because it suggests Juan is building alternative power bases\n\n**His approach:**\n- He will be superficially polite and helpful\n- He will use bureaucratic control to gather intelligence and slow things down\n- He will probe to understand what Juan has been promising\n- He will try to reassert the regency council as the proper channel for all dealings\n- He won't be openly hostile, but he won't be helpful either\n\nJuan has invited him to discuss matters of his own concern. This is smart - Juan is asking before telling (what he learned from Lucia). But Don Ramon will be cautious about revealing what he actually wants. He'll test Juan first.\n\nLet me write the scene.\n\nNow I have the full context from both guides. Let me continue the scene with Don Ramon.\n\nDon Ramon inclines his head at Juan's offer, his expression revealing nothing.\n\n\"Your Majesty is gracious.\"\n\nHe does not immediately continue. Instead, he moves to the window, adjusting the angle of a shutter as if the light offended him. When he turns back, his hands are clasped behind his back—the posture of a man preparing to deliver a report.\n\n\"The matter of the itinerary is not... merely logistical.\" He pauses, selecting his words with evident care. \"Barcelona is not Toledo, Your Majesty. The Consell de Cent guards its prerogatives jealously. The Count of Pallars speaks for nobles who remember when Aragón's king lived in Aragón. The merchants want to know whether Castilian trade agreements will respect Catalan privileges.\"\n\nHe moves to the desk, picks up a document, sets it down again without looking at it.\n\n\"In four years as head of the regency council, I have learned that scheduling is governance. Who sees the king, and when, and in what order—these things matter. They send signals. They create expectations. They establish... hierarchies.\"\n\nHis eyes meet Juan's directly for the first time.\n\n\"Your Majesty arrived yesterday evening. Since then, you have spoken privately with Don Guillem de Vic, with the Count of Pallars, and this morning—at considerable length—with Bishop Climent Sapera.\" The recitation is precise, without inflection. \"The regency council was not consulted regarding any of these conversations.\"\n\nHe lets the observation hang in the air, then adds, almost as an afterthought:\n\n\"Queen María has requested that I coordinate all further meetings through Her Majesty's secretary. She wishes to be informed in advance of Your Majesty's appointments.\"",

He does not say of course or think nothing of it. He simply... notes it.\n\nWhen Juan asks about matters to discuss and the council's concerns, Don Ramon's expression shifts almost imperceptibly—a tightening around the eyes that might be frustration, might be calculation.\n\n\"Your Majesty asks what the council's concerns are.\" He moves back toward the desk, fingers brushing the stack of documents there. \"That is a... complex question. The council's concerns depend greatly on circumstances. On what is being proposed. On what commitments may already have been made.\"\n\nHe looks up.\n\n\"I have served as head of this council for four years. In that time, I have learned that I cannot advise a king on what he should do until I understand what he has done.\" The words are precise, carefully neutral. \"Don Guillem de Vic left the reception last night speaking of 'great things to come' and 'bringing the kingdoms together.' The Count of Pallars sent a messenger to his estates at first light—I do not know why. Bishop Climent Sapera has reportedly cancelled his morning appointments to draft letters to the Archbishop of Tarragona.\"\n\nHe spreads his hands—a gesture that might be helplessness, might be invitation.\n\n\"What should the regency council's concerns be, Your Majesty? What has been discussed? What has been offered? What expectations now exist that did not exist two days ago?\"\n\nThe question sits between them like a stone on a scale.",

      "text": "**What Juan is offering:**\n- Complete transparency about his conversations\n- His vision for unified kingdoms where neither dominates\n- Admission that he discussed succession with María\n- Admission he should have asked first\n- A direct question about what happens if Alfonso dies\n\n**What Don Ramon wants:**\n- To understand what damage control is needed\n- To reassert the regency council's role as proper channel\n- To understand Juan's real intentions (is \"unity\" cover for Castilian absorption?)\n- Information about what's been promised\n\n**Success Factors (things that help Juan):**\n1. Complete transparency - Don Ramon wanted information, Juan is providing it\n2. Admission of error - Juan acknowledges he should have consulted María first\n3. The vision of \"neither holding dominance\" - addresses the core fear of Castilian absorption\n4. Asking Don Ramon directly about succession - shows respect for his knowledge\n5. Juan's track record (Reconquista, papal favor) gives weight to his words\n\n**Failure Factors (things working against Juan):**\n1. The damage may already be done - factions are already reacting\n2. \"Vision for a better world\" sounds grandiose and potentially dangerous\n3. Discussing succession with María before the regency council is a serious breach\n4. Don Ramon has been managing these factions for 4 years - he knows how fragile the balance is\n5. \"Bringing kingdoms together\" even without dominance still threatens Aragonese independence\n6. Juan is essentially asking Don Ramon to trust his intentions after bypassing him\n7. Don Ramon serves María and Alfonso, not Juan - his loyalty is to Aragon's interests\n8. The succession question is extremely sensitive - Carlos of Viana is dead, which changes everything\n\n**Key psychological factors:**\n- Don Ramon has sunk costs - 4 years of careful balance\n- Identity: he is the guardian of Aragonese interests, not a facilitator for Castilian ambitions\n\n- Deeply risk-averse approach to potential kingdom-altering decisions\n- Prioritizes maintaining the delicate political equilibrium he's carefully constructed\n\nThe political landscape reveals critical uncertainties. Succession hangs in a precarious balance, with no clear heir and multiple potential claims. Juan's approach demonstrates strategic transparency, but risks undermining the established political mechanisms that Don Ramon has meticulously maintained.\n\nApproach Quality Assessment:\n\nSuccess Factors:\n\nComplete transparency—Don Ramon asked for information and is receiving it fully\n\nAdmission of error regarding María—shows self-awareness and humility\n\n\"Neither holding dominance\"—directly addresses the core Aragonese fear\n\nAsking Don Ramon's expertise on succession—shows respect for his knowledge\n\nJuan's track record (Reconquista completed, papal favor, treasury returned) gives credibility\n\nFailure Factors:\n\nFour years of careful factional balance may have been disrupted in twenty-four hours\n\n\"Vision for a better world\" sounds like messianic grandiosity—alarming to a pragmatist\n\nDiscussing succession with María before the regency council is a serious breach of protocol\n\nDon Ramon serves Aragón, not Castile—his job is to protect Aragonese interests\n\nEven \"unity without dominance\" still threatens Aragonese independence and identity\n\nDon Guillem, Pallars, and the Bishop are already acting on conversations Don Ramon wasn't party to\n\nJuan is asking Don Ramon to trust intentions after bypassing him completely\n\nThe succession question is extraordinarily sensitive—Juan asking about it raises questions about his own ambitions\n\nComplicating Factor:\nDon Ramon now has the information he wanted—but what he's learned is not reassuring. Transparency is valuable, but the content of that transparency reveals a Castilian king with grand visions who has already been making private arrangements with Aragonese factions.\n\nD100 REACTION TABLE: Don Ramon de Perellós\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-15\nDeeply Alarmed. The \"vision\" confirms his worst fears—this is Castilian absorption dressed in idealistic language. Don Ramon becomes coldly formal, offers nothing, and will immediately brief María that Juan's intentions are more ambitious than suspected. The regency council will coordinate resistance.\n16-35\nGuarded and Skeptical. Appreciates the honesty but finds the content alarming. Asks pointed, uncomfortable questions about what \"neither holding dominance\" actually means in practice. Provides minimal information about succession, citing need to consult with María first. Will not obstruct but will not help.\n36-55\nCautiously Receptive. The transparency earns some credit, but Don Ramon remains noncommittal. He acknowledges the vision without endorsing it. Answers the succession question factually but without interpretation. Suggests that any further discussions of this nature should include María and the full council.\n56-70\nProfessionally Engaged. Don Ramon recognizes that Juan's approach—however irregular—was at least honest. He provides a frank assessment of the succession situation and the factional dynamics Juan has stirred. Offers practical advice on managing the remaining Barcelona visit, though stops short of endorsing the vision.\n71-85\nGenuine Interest. Something in Juan's delivery—perhaps the admission of error, perhaps the explicit rejection of Castilian dominance—creates an opening. Don Ramon asks substantive questions about implementation, reveals some of his own frustrations with the current situation, and offers more detailed guidance. Still cautious, but engaged.\n86-95\nThoughtful Partnership. Don Ramon has spent four years managing an impossible situation—a king who won't come home, factions pulling in opposite directions, a regent with no children and an uncertain future. Juan's vision, delivered with humility, offers something he hadn't dared hope for: a path forward. He speaks frankly about Aragón's real situation and his own concerns.\n96-100\nUnexpected Alignment. Don Ramon reveals that he has privately worried about exactly these questions for years—what happens when Alfonso dies, what becomes of Aragón, whether the kingdom can survive its own divisions. Juan's transparency and vision resonate deeply. He becomes a genuine ally, offering insights and assistance beyond what protocol requires.\n\nShall I roll?",

That, at least, is a matter of law rather than vision.\" His tone is neutral, instructional—a steward explaining accounts. \"King Alfonso has no legitimate children. Queen María has borne none, and the physicians hold little hope after so many years. Should Alfonso die, the Crown of Aragón passes to his nearest male relative.\"\n\nHe pauses, as if waiting for Juan to complete the thought himself.\n\n\"The Infantes Juan and Enrique are dead. Their legitimate male issue—Carlos of Viana—is also dead. This leaves...\" He spreads his hands slightly. \"King Ferdinand of Aragón, Alfonso's father, had one other son who survived infancy. That son married into the House of Trastámara. His daughter María is our regent. His son...\"\n\nDon Ramon's eyes meet Juan's.\n\n\"His son is Your Majesty.\"\n\nThe words hang in the air. He lets them settle before continuing.\n\n\"By strict succession law, should Alfonso die without heir, the Crown of Aragón would pass to the descendants of Ferdinand's second son—that is, to Juan II of Castile. Your Majesty is, in fact, Alfonso's heir presumptive.\"\n\nHe says this as simple fact, without interpretation.\n\n\"The regency council is aware of this. The factions are aware of this. When Your Majesty speaks of 'bringing kingdoms together,' every man in Barcelona hears it through this lens.\"\n\nHe moves back toward the desk, straightening papers that do not need straightening.\n\n\"I would suggest that further discussions regarding succession—or visions of unity—include Her Majesty the Regent and the full council. These are not matters for private conversations with faction leaders and bishops.\"\n\nHe looks up.\n\n\"Is there anything else Your Majesty requires for the midday reception with the Consell de Cent?\"",

The Count of Pallars has the afternoon. Don Guillem wishes to present his drafted communications. Your Majesty departs for Rome within... how many days?\"\n\nHe looks up, waiting for the answer before continuing.\n\n\"A full council meeting requires the presence of all principal members. Don Berenguer de Bardaxí is at his estates—two days' ride. The Bishop of Girona sits on the council; he is in Girona. The Viscount of Rocabertí...\" He shakes his head slightly. \"These men cannot be summoned like servants. They must be invited, given time to arrange their affairs, travel to Barcelona.\"\n\nHe closes the ledger.\n\n\"And Her Majesty the Regent must, of course, preside. Given Your Majesty's conversation with her this morning, I would suggest...\" He pauses, choosing words carefully. \"I would suggest that Her Majesty's consent to such a meeting should be obtained before invitations are dispatched.\"\n\nHis tone is perfectly correct, perfectly neutral.\n\n\"Shall I inquire of Her Majesty whether she finds such a meeting advisable, and if so, when it might be convened? I could have an answer for Your Majesty by this evening. After the Count of Pallars, perhaps.\"",

The Constantinople expedition is planned for spring 1434.\n\nFrom the chapter summaries, the fleet and 700 knights are ready. Juan needs to:\n1. Visit Rome (present Declaration of Como to Pope, etc.)\n2. Then proceed to Constantinople\n\nIf they leave Barcelona around March 1st, that gives them roughly 4-5 weeks in Barcelona from late January.\n\nLet me be more precise:\n- Mid-January departure from Toledo = ~January 15\n- 11 days travel = arrival January 26\n- Current day (Day 12) = January 27, 1434\n\nSo from January 27 to March 1 = approximately 33 days, or roughly 4-5 weeks.\n\nActually, I should check if there's more specific information about the departure date for Rome. Let me think about what was established in earlier chapters.\n\nFrom the timeline:\n- Isabel's delivery was late July/August 1433\n- The baby (Prince Fernando) was born\n- Juan married Lucia (Queen Isabel died in childbirth based on Chapter 2.11-2.13)\n\n- January 1434: journey to Barcelona with 700 knights\n\nI'm tracking Juan's strategic maritime expedition. He'll sail to Rome first, spending about 1-2 weeks traveling by sea. This allows him to present the Declaration of Como to the Pope and secure diplomatic support. After Rome, he'll continue to Constantinople before summer, aligning with the spring 1434 expedition plan. The timing looks precise: leaving Barcelona in early March gives him ample time to complete both critical diplomatic missions.\n\nStaying in Barcelona for roughly a month provides crucial preparation time for the complex naval journey ahead.\n\nGM Timeline Calculation:\n\nBased on Chapter 2.15:\n\nDeparture from Toledo: Mid-January 1434\n\nJourney duration: 11 days\n\nArrival in Barcelona: Approximately January 26, 1434\n\nCurrent day (Day 12): Approximately January 27, 1434\n\nThe Constantinople expedition is planned for spring 1434, and Juan must visit Rome first to present the Declaration of Como to Pope Eugenius IV personally and coordinate on various matters (Naples support for Alfonso, Military Orders, Constantinople aid).\n\nIf Juan aims to depart Barcelona by early March (around March 1-5), that gives him approximately 4-5 weeks remaining in Barcelona.\n\nThe fleet of 700 Military Order knights and the royal flagship Princess Catalina await departure. The sea voyage from Barcelona to Rome takes approximately 1-2 weeks depending on weather. From Rome to Constantinople would be several weeks more.\n\nSo to answer Don Ramon's implicit question: Juan has roughly five weeks before he must sail, assuming early March departure for Rome.\n\nDo you want to answer Don Ramon with this timeframe, or adjust your plans?",

When asked about privileges under a shared king, say \"not much will change, more cooperation, trade, security\"\n\nDon Ramon's perspective:\n- He's a pragmatist who has managed these factions for four years\n- He serves Aragonese interests\n- He's cautious about Juan's grand visions\n- He just got what he wanted: acknowledgment of council authority\n\nNow Juan is saying \"I never announced myself as heir apparent.\" This is technically true - Juan didn't explicitly say \"I am Alfonso's heir.\" But Don Ramon just told Juan this himself, and everyone in Barcelona already knows it.\n\nWhat would Don Ramon think of Juan's answer about \"not much will change\"?\n\nThis is a vague answer that the merchants will absolutely probe. \"More cooperation, trade, security\" - these are platitudes. The merchants want specifics:\n- Will Barcelona's port privileges be protected?\n- Will Catalan merchants have equal access to Granada's ports?\n- Will Castilian wool undercut Catalan cloth?\n- Who controls customs duties?\n\nDon Ramon is a careful man. He's not going to tell Juan what to say - that's not his role and he doesn't want to be responsible for Juan's positions. But he might point out the weakness in Juan's approach.\n\nAlso, Juan saying \"Fortunately, I have never announced myself as Alfonso's heir\" - this is a bit naive. Don Ramon literally just explained that everyone already knows this. The succession law is clear. Juan doesn't need to announce it; it's simply fact.\n\nDon Ramon would probably find this slightly... evasive? Or perhaps naive? The merchants won't care whether Juan announced it - they know the law.\n\nWhat does Don Ramon want here? He wants:\n1. To not be blamed if Juan makes mistakes with the merchants\n\n2. To maintain council authority\n3. To protect Aragonese interests\n4. Information about what Juan actually intends\n\nI'll subtly guide Juan to recognize the inadequacy of his current strategy. By highlighting the merchants' likely skepticism without prescribing specific responses, I'll push him to develop more substantive answers that address real economic concerns.\n\nThe merchants require concrete assurances about trade, privileges, and economic stability. Juan's current approach risks appearing unprepared and potentially threatening their established commercial interests.\n\nNPC Analysis - Don Ramon de Perellós (continued):\n\nWhat he wants: To ensure Juan understands the insufficiency of vague assurances without taking responsibility for advising him\n\nWhat he won't say: What specific commitments might satisfy the merchants; whether he thinks Juan's evasion will actually work\n\nDon Ramon's expression flickers—something that might almost be amusement, quickly suppressed.\n\n\"Your Majesty did not need to announce it. I announced it to you not a quarter hour ago, and I am hardly the first man in Barcelona to know the succession laws of Aragón.\"\n\nHe returns to his chair, settling into it with the air of a man preparing to observe something instructive.\n\n\"'Not much will change. More cooperation, trade, security.'\" He repeats the words slowly, as if tasting them. \"These are... pleasant words. The merchants of the Consell de Cent will smile and nod.\"\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\"And then they will ask: What does 'more cooperation' mean for the wool staple at Burgos? Will Catalan merchants have equal access to Málaga and Almería? If Granada's silk competes with Valencia's silk, whose merchants receive preference? When Castilian and Catalan ships both seek the same North African contract, who arbitrates?\"\n\nDon Ramon folds his hands in his lap.\n\n\"They will not ask whether Your Majesty intends to become King of Aragón.

Wooden benches line the chamber in rising tiers, and upon them sit the jurats: one hundred men in dark robes and furred caps, the elected governors of one of the Mediterranean's greatest trading cities.\n\nAt the far end, five high-backed chairs face the chamber. The consellers en cap are already seated—five men of varying ages, their chains of office glinting in the light from high windows.\n\nThe hall falls silent as Juan and Lucia enter.\n\nA man in the central chair rises. He is perhaps sixty, with a neatly trimmed grey beard and the calculating eyes of a man who has spent a lifetime reading contracts and partners alike.\n\n\"Your Majesties of Castile.\" His Catalan accent is thick but his Castilian is serviceable. \"Barcelona welcomes you. I am Pere Joan de Sant Climent, conseller en cap. We are honored by your presence in our city.\"\n\nThe words are correct. The tone is... measuring.\n\n\"We understand Your Majesty has recently achieved a great victory against the Moor.\" He gestures to the assembly. \"The Consell wishes to offer its congratulations.

Polite acknowledgment\n2. Admitted he hasn't made major decisions yet\n3. Suggested summoning traders to create a system\n4. Stated aim of increasing trade and cooperation\n5. Mentioned moving against Muslim piracy\n6. Offered that Castile could draw on Aragonese expertise\n\nThis is vague - exactly what Don Ramon warned against. The merchants will probe harder. The piracy angle is interesting but Juan hasn't offered them anything concrete. The \"expertise\" comment could be seen as flattering or as an empty gesture.\n\nI should have the conseller push for specifics while remaining polite. He represents merchants - they want concrete terms, not aspirations.\n\nNPC Analysis - Pere Joan de Sant Climent (Conseller en Cap):\n\nWhat he wants: Concrete terms—preferential access, tariff agreements, guarantees that Catalan merchants won't be squeezed out of the southern trade; something he can report to the hundred men behind him\n\nWhat he won't say: That Barcelona has already lost contracts to Genoese merchants moving into Granada; that \"cooperation\" with a larger kingdom usually means absorption; that vague promises from kings are worth less than the paper they're not written on\n\nSant Climent's expression remains pleasant, but something flickers behind his eyes—the look of a man who has just been handed a promissory note of uncertain value.\n\n\"Your Majesty speaks of aims and intentions. Admirable.\" He inclines his head. \"And the campaign against piracy is... welcome news. Barcelona has lost fourteen vessels to Salé corsairs in the past two years alone.\"\n\nHe glances briefly at the man seated to his left—a younger man with ink-stained fingers and sharp features. The merchants' representative. Senyor Bernat Fiveller.\n\nFiveller leans forward.\n\n\"Your Majesty mentions summoning traders to create a system. A worthy thought.\" His Castilian is more polished than Sant Climent's, but colder. \"Might we ask—which traders? Castilian traders from Seville, who already control the Atlantic routes? Or will Catalan houses receive equal voice in this... council?\"\n\nA murmur passes through the benches. Fiveller continues, his tone still courteous but pressing:\n\n\"Your Majesty speaks of cooperation. Of aligned interests. We hear these words and we are grateful for them.\" He spreads his hands. \"But Your Majesty will forgive us—we are merchants. We think in contracts, not sentiments. When Málaga's harbor opens to Christian trade, will a Catalan ship pay the same duties as a Castilian ship? Will Barcelona's cloth merchants have the same rights in Granada's markets as Burgos wool factors?\"\n\nHe pauses, letting the questions settle.\n\n\"These are not challenges, Your Majesty. Merely... the questions that keep merchants awake at night.\"\n\nFrom the artisans' chair, an older man with calloused hands speaks without rising—a breach of protocol that draws a sharp glance from Sant Climent.\n\n\"And what of competition, Majestic? Granada's weavers are skilled. Moorish silk is prized throughout Christendom.\" His Castilian is rougher, accented. \"If Granada's looms now serve Castile, what becomes of Valencia's silk? Of Barcelona's cloth? Will Your Majesty's 'cooperation' flood our markets with cheaper goods while calling it friendship?\"\n\nThe hall is very quiet.",

Why are you so interested in me if I'm not your king?\"\n\nThis puts them in an awkward position because:\n- They can't openly say \"because you'll probably be our king soon\"\n- They're revealing their anxiety about the succession\n- They have to explain why they think Juan's decisions matter to them\n\nLet me think about how the NPCs would respond:\n\nSant Climent - the conseller en cap - is the political one. He'll try to smooth things over.\nFiveller - the merchants' representative - is more direct about commercial interests.\nThe artisan who spoke out of turn - he's worried about competition.\n\nLucia is also present. Juan looked at her. Should she react? The player mentioned looking at Lucia but didn't say she should speak. Let me have her give a subtle reaction but not speak unless Juan asks her to.\n\nThe question Juan asked is pointed - why does a foreign king matter so much to them? This forces them to confront the elephant in the room (succession) or admit they're being presumptuous.\n\nSant Climent will probably try to give a diplomatic answer. But Fiveller might be more blunt.\n\nWhat they want: Concrete guarantees about trade access\nWhat they won't say: That they assume Juan will be their king and are trying to lock in favorable terms now while they have leverage\n\nLet me write this scene.\n\nNPC Analysis - The Consell de Cent (collective):\n\nWhat they want: To lock in favorable terms now, while Juan needs Aragonese goodwill, before he becomes their king and no longer needs to negotiate\n\nWhat they won't say: That they're treating this as a pre-succession negotiation; that a foreign king who will likely become their king is not truly foreign; that their leverage disappears the moment Alfonso dies\n\nLucia meets Juan's glance. Her expression is calm, but there's a flicker of something—approval, perhaps, or quiet amusement. She does not speak, but her slight nod suggests: Yes. Make them say it.\n\nThe hall stirs. The artisan who spoke out of turn shifts uncomfortably in his seat. Fiveller's eyes narrow almost imperceptibly.\n\nSant Climent raises a hand, stilling the murmurs.\n\n\"Your Majesty asks a fair question.\" His tone is careful now, the merchant's smile replaced by something more measured. \"You are correct. You are King of Castile. Aragonese trade policy is a matter for King Alfonso and the regency council. We overstep.\"\n\nHe pauses. The silence stretches.\n\n\"And yet.\"\n\nHe folds his hands before him.\n\n\"Your Majesty will forgive us if we speak plainly. We are Catalans. Plainness is our vice.\" A small ripple of laughter from the benches, quickly suppressed. \"King Alfonso pursues his destiny in Naples. Queen María holds Aragón in trust. And the man who stands before us today is...\"\n\nHe stops, choosing his next words with evident care.\n\n\"...a man of great consequence. A man who has achieved what no Christian king has achieved in two centuries. A man whose shadow falls long across all of Iberia.\"\n\nFiveller cuts in, less patient than his elder.\n\n\"Your Majesty asks what a Castilian king could do to address our concerns. The answer is simple: nothing. Today.\" He emphasizes the word. \"But we are merchants. We plan for tomorrow. We sign contracts that bind our grandchildren. We think in generations.\"\n\nHe gestures to the hundred men seated behind him.\n\n\"Every man in this chamber knows the succession laws of Aragón. Every man knows that King Alfonso has no heir. Every man knows who stands next in line.\"\n\nThe words hang in the air—the thing that Don Ramon said, now spoken aloud in a hall of one hundred witnesses.\n\n\"We do not ask Your Majesty to make promises you cannot keep. We ask only...\" Fiveller spreads his hands, \"...to understand what kind of king you are. Whether you see Barcelona as a partner or as a... subject.\"\n\nThe artisan speaks again, quieter now: \"Whether our children will weave cloth or beg in the streets.\"",

      "text": "**Juan's Approach:**\n1. Embraces their \"plainness\" - builds rapport\n2. Self-deprecating about pride, mentions Lucia will keep him honest\n3. Explains his trade philosophy: what increases trade most, benefits the kingdom\n4. Admits Castile's weakness in naval/trade matters compared to Aragon\n5. Mentions his fleet is at Alfonso's disposal for Naples\n6. Admits ignorance about specific trade policies\n7. Promises to seek advice from bodies like theirs\n8. Focuses on outcomes (increased trade) rather than specific commitments\n\n**NPC Analysis - How should the Consell react?**\n\nThis is a skillful non-answer. Juan has:\n- Avoided committing to anything specific\n- Flattered them by admitting Castilian weakness in their area of expertise\n- Promised consultation without promising results\n- Kept things vague while sounding reasonable\n\nThe merchants are professionals. They've heard kings promise \"consultation\" before. They want specifics:\n- Equal tariffs or not?\n- Catalan access to Granada ports?\n- Protection against Granada silk flooding their markets?\n\nJuan gave them philosophy, not contracts. Some will appreciate the humility and openness. Others will see it as evasion.\n\nI should have them push back - not rudely, but merchants don't let vague answers stand. They need something concrete to report to their guilds.\n\nLet me think about who responds:\n- Sant Climent (the elder statesman) might appreciate the diplomatic approach\n- Fiveller (the sharp merchant) will push for specifics\n- The artisan already spoke out of turn - he's worried about his livelihood\n\nI need a roll here to see how this lands. Let me draft a d100 table.\n\n**Success Factors:**\n1. Humility about Castilian naval weakness - shows he's not arrogant\n2. Fleet at Alfonso's disposal - concrete action, not just words\n\n3. Promise to consult bodies like theirs - acknowledges their importance\n4. Philosophy of \"what increases trade most\" - sounds reasonable\n5. Bringing Lucia and joking about her keeping him honest - humanizing\n6. Matching their \"plainness\" - cultural respect\n\nJuan's diplomatic strategy balances cultural sensitivity with strategic ambiguity. His approach demonstrates respect while avoiding binding commitments, potentially giving him flexibility in future negotiations. The Consell will likely be divided - some appreciating his openness, others demanding more concrete assurances about trade specifics.\n\nThe Catalan ships' equal duty status and subtle reference to potential succession create an underlying tension. While consultation doesn't guarantee actual power-sharing, it signals potential willingness to engage. The merchants will scrutinize these nuanced statements, seeking deeper implications beyond surface-level promises.\n\nNPC Analysis - The Consell's Reaction:\n\nWhat they want: Still waiting for specifics; philosophy is pleasant but unenforceable\n\nWhat they won't say: That \"seeking advice\" from councils means nothing if the king ignores that advice; that Castile's naval weakness is precisely why they fear absorption—a king who needs their ships has more reason to take them\n\nA murmur ripples through the benches—not hostile, but not satisfied either. Men lean toward one another, exchanging quick words in Catalan.\n\nSant Climent tilts his head, considering.\n\n\"Your Majesty speaks well. And with... refreshing honesty about Castile's limitations.\" There's a hint of warmth in his voice now. \"We appreciate that you do not pretend expertise you do not possess.\"\n\nFiveller is less mollified. He taps a finger against the arm of his chair.\n\n\"Your Majesty says you will seek advice from bodies such as ours. We are grateful.\" The words are polite; the tone is not quite. \"But seeking advice and heeding advice are different things. Castile has a Cortes. Aragón has Corts. Both give advice. Kings do not always listen.\"\n\nHe leans forward.\n\n\"You say you want policies that increase trade. So do we. But whose trade? When a Castilian merchant and a Catalan merchant both want the same contract in Málaga, whose trade increases?\" He spreads his hands. \"This is not philosophy, Your Majesty. This is Tuesday.\"\n\nThe artisan—emboldened now—speaks again.\n\n\"And the silk, Majestic. You did not answer about the silk. Granada's weavers will sell cheaper than ours. They always have. Will 'increasing trade' mean Moorish silk in every market while my apprentices starve?\"\n\nSant Climent raises a hand, quieting the artisan, but his eyes remain on Juan.\n\n\"Perhaps Your Majesty might offer us something... smaller. Not a trade policy—we understand that is premature. But a gesture. A sign of intent.\" He pauses. \"When Catalan ships arrive at Málaga, will they be welcomed as friends? Will Your Majesty instruct your port officials to treat our merchants as... partners in this increased trade you envision?\"\n\nThe question is simple. The stakes behind it are not.",

Granada was just conquered. The ports are new Christian territory. Juan hasn't actually set up trade policies yet - it's been less than a year since the conquest.

The new Christian administration is still finding its feet.\"\n\nHe begins to pace slowly before the consellers' bench.\n\n\"In such chaos, advantage flows to those with connections. Castilian merchants from Seville know your port officials. They speak the same language. They worship in the same churches. They have cousins and brothers-in-law in the customs houses.\" He turns to face Juan. \"A Catalan merchant arrives in Málaga and he is... a foreigner. Tolerated, yes. But a foreigner.\"\n\nSant Climent interjects, his tone more measured: \"There is no law against Catalan trade in Granada's ports. But law and practice are different things. A Castilian factor obtains a license in three days. A Catalan factor waits three weeks. A Castilian ship unloads at the prime berths. A Catalan ship anchors in the outer harbor.\"\n\nFiveller nods. \"These are not conspiracies, Your Majesty. They are... human nature. Your officials favor their own. As ours would.\"\n\nHe stops pacing.\n\n\"So when we ask whether Catalan ships will be welcomed as friends—we ask whether Your Majesty will instruct your officials that Catalans are not foreigners. That we are... partners. With the same rights, the same access, the same three days for a license.\"\n\nHe pauses, then adds quietly:\n\n\"That is not a trade policy. That is a letter.

Juan has turned the tables. The merchants came expecting to extract promises from a king who needs goodwill. Instead, he's made them realize they're asking for things they can't reciprocate.\n\nSant Climent is the senior statesman - he'll recognize what just happened. Fiveller is the aggressive merchant who's been pushing hardest - he's the one most caught out. The artisan just wants protection for his weavers and doesn't care about the politics.\n\nThe key dynamic here is that the Consell de Cent governs Barcelona, but they don't set Aragonese trade policy - that's the regency council's domain. They can commit Barcelona's resources and behavior, but not the Crown of Aragón's.\n\nLet me write this scene where they realize they've overreached and need to recalibrate.\n\nNPC Analysis - The Consell's Reaction:\n\nWhat they want: To extract maximum concessions while committing to as little as possible\n\nWhat they won't say: That they don't actually have authority to commit Aragón to reciprocal trade policy—that's the regency council's domain; that Juan has just caught them overreaching; that they were treating him as a supplicant rather than an equal sovereign\n\nThe hall falls silent.\n\nSant Climent's expression shifts—a flicker of something that might be respect, might be recalculation. He glances at his fellow consellers. Fiveller's jaw tightens almost imperceptibly.\n\nA long moment passes.\n\n\"Your Majesty raises a... fair point.\" Sant Climent's voice is measured, careful. \"We have perhaps spoken as though this chamber sets policy for the Crown of Aragón. It does not. We govern Barcelona. We advise Her Majesty the Regent. But trade policy for the realm...\"\n\nHe spreads his hands.\n\n\"That is a matter for the regency council. We cannot commit King Alfonso to reciprocal treatment of Castilian merchants in Aragonese ports. That is not our authority.\"\n\nFiveller shifts in his chair, visibly uncomfortable. The man who demanded specifics now finds himself without standing to offer them.\n\nThe citizens' representative speaks, his lawyer's mind working quickly.\n\n\"What we can commit, Your Majesty, is Barcelona. This city. This port.\" He gestures to the hundred men behind him. \"If Your Majesty instructs Málaga and Almería to treat Catalans as equals, this council can instruct Barcelona's harbor officials to extend the same courtesy to Castilians. Equal berthing. Equal licensing times. Equal treatment in the customs house.\"\n\nSant Climent nods slowly. \"That much is within our power. And we would be... willing to put it in writing. A matching commitment. Barcelona's word alongside Castile's.\"\n\nThe artisan looks confused—the political maneuvering has moved beyond his concerns. But Fiveller leans forward, his merchant instincts engaged again.\n\n\"And the trading conference. If Barcelona hosts such a meeting, we commit our resources. Our halls. Our hospitality.\" He pauses. \"That is something concrete we can offer.\"\n\nSant Climent looks at Juan directly.\n\n\"Is this acceptable, Your Majesty? Barcelona's commitment, in writing, to match your own terms—equal treatment, equal access—for Castilian merchants in our port? And our pledge to host and support the international gathering you propose?\"",

They shall coordinate such efforts with the Kingdom of Aragón, should that realm choose to commit forces to this righteous cause.\n\nSecond, that all harbor officials within Our realm, and most especially those of Málaga, Almería, and such other ports as fall under Our authority, shall treat merchants of Aragón and Portugal as they would treat merchants of Castile—subject to the same customs, the same duties, the same courtesies, and the same speed of licensing, with no distinction made upon the origin of their vessels.\n\nThird, that Don García López de Padilla, Governor of Granada, shall develop such policies as prevent the silk trade of that newly Christian territory from flooding and disrupting the markets of our brother kingdoms, so that the integration of Granada into Christendom proceeds with balance and justice to all.\n\nFourth, that Our officials shall adopt a practice of informing the merchants of Portugal and Aragón of significant changes to customs rates and trading regulations, so that honest traders may make informed decisions.\n\nFifth, that We encourage the city of Barcelona, should it choose to host a gathering of traders from the Christian kingdoms of Iberia, and We shall encourage Castilian merchants to attend such a meeting in good faith, sending proper delegation to work toward the common flourishing of trade.\n\nGiven under Our hand, in the city of Barcelona, in the year of Our Lord fourteen hundred and thirty-four.\n\nJuan Rex\"\n\nLucia lowers the parchment and looks to Juan, awaiting his approval before the seal is applied.\n\nThe hall remains silent for a long moment. Then Sant Climent rises slowly from his chair.\n\n\"This is... more than we expected, Your Majesty.\" His voice carries a weight that was not there before. \"Barcelona will honor its commitment. Equal treatment for Castilian merchants in our port. In writing, as promised.\"\n\nHe turns to face the hundred men behind him.\n\n\"Does the Consell de Cent consent to Barcelona's reciprocal commitment?\"\n\nA murmur rises—and then, starting from the merchants' benches and spreading through the artisans and citizens, a growing chorus:\n\n\"Sí.

The merchants got more than they expected; Juan established himself as someone who acts rather than just talks. But I shouldn't make it too triumphant - these are still cautious men who will wait to see if the words become reality.\n\nJuan steps to the small table where Lucia sits. A clerk hurries forward with sealing wax and the royal signet. The scratch of the quill as Juan signs is loud in the silent hall.\n\nThe wax melts, drips, spreads. The signet presses down. When Juan lifts his hand, the lions of Castile and León stare up from the crimson seal.\n\nLucia rises, handing the document to Sant Climent with a graceful incline of her head. The old conseller receives it with both hands—a gesture of respect typically reserved for holy relics or royal charters.\n\n\"Your Majesties.\" Sant Climent bows, deeper than protocol requires. \"Barcelona will remember this day.\"\n\nFiveller bows as well, his merchant's mask back in place but something genuine flickering beneath it. \"We will have our own commitment drafted and sealed within the week.

Complete honesty about succession - addresses the elephant in the room directly\n2. Framing it as wanting to be known/to know Aragon - not conquest but relationship\n3.

Juan has been \"charming\" everyone in Barcelona - could look like a calculated campaign\n4. The succession question is precisely what worries Pallars most\n5. \"Wanting to know Aragon\" could sound like reconnaissance before conquest\n6.

His family's blood spilled in Alfonso's Italian campaigns creates a visceral, emotional barrier to trusting Juan. The potential heir's previous support of the Naples venture directly contradicts Pallars' core desire to protect Aragonese lives and resources. This personal trauma will heavily influence his reaction to Juan's honest admission.\n\nApproach Quality Assessment:\n\nSuccess Factors:\n\nComplete honesty about succession—addresses the elephant directly rather than evading\n\n\"Aragon charming me\" deflection shows wit without being dismissive\n\nFraming as wanting to know Aragón and be known—relationship, not conquest\n\nAcknowledges Alfonso is alive and respects the current king's position\n\nReligious reference to the bishop—shows genuine spiritual dimension\n\nCorrectly identifies the questions everyone is asking—demonstrates he understands their fears\n\nFailure Factors:\n\nPallars represents men whose sons have died in Italian wars—Juan has been funding those wars\n\nThe 40,000 florins Juan sent to Alfonso enables exactly what the Aragonese faction opposes\n\n\"Hopefully for many years\" doesn't address what happens when Alfonso dies\n\nJuan's \"vision\" of unity still sounds like absorption to a man defending Aragonese independence\n\nPallars asked why Juan is working so hard to charm them—Juan deflected rather than answered directly\n\nThe succession admission confirms Pallars' suspicion: Juan is here to prepare his inheritance\n\nPallars sent a messenger to his estates at first light—he's already preparing for something\n\nThe Aragonese faction wants Alfonso to abandon Naples; Juan wants Alfonso to win Naples\n\nCritical Tension:\nPallars' core question remains unanswered: Will Juan help end the Italian bleeding, or continue enabling it?\n\nD100 REACTION TABLE: Count of Pallars\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-15\nCold Rejection. The honesty about succession confirms Pallars' fears—this is a Castilian king preparing to inherit, not a potential ally. He notes pointedly that Juan's gold has funded the Italian campaign that kills Aragonese sons. The conversation becomes formal and unproductive. Pallars will report to the Aragonese faction that Juan is Alfonso's enabler, not their salvation.\n16-30\nSuspicious Skepticism. Pallars appreciates the directness but remains guarded. He presses harder: if Juan becomes king, will Aragonese sons continue dying for Naples? Will Castilian interests override Aragonese ones? The questions become pointed and uncomfortable. He offers nothing and commits to nothing.\n31-45\nGrudging Respect, No Ground Given. The honesty earns credit, but Pallars has heard kings speak of \"knowing\" realms before conquest. He acknowledges Juan's candor while making clear the Aragonese faction will judge by actions, not words. He reveals little of his own position and deflects questions about what the faction wants.\n46-60\nCautious Engagement. Pallars recognizes something different in Juan's approach—most would-be kings don't admit their ambitions so plainly. He begins to speak more openly about the Aragonese faction's concerns: the Italian bleeding, the absent king, the uncertain future. But he stops short of asking for anything or offering alliance. Testing continues.\n61-75\nFrank Discussion. The directness unlocks something. Pallars admits the Aragonese faction has discussed the succession question among themselves. He speaks plainly about what they fear and what they want—an end to Italian adventures, a king who lives in Aragón, respect for Aragonese institutions. He asks what Juan would actually do differently than Alfonso.\n76-85\nGenuine Opening. Pallars has spent years watching Alfonso pour Aragonese blood into Italian soil. A king who admits he wants to know Aragón—who asks questions rather than makes demands—offers something different. He reveals the faction's position more fully and asks pointed but constructive questions about Juan's intentions. A foundation for trust begins to form.\n86-95\nUnexpected Alignment. Pallars confesses that the Aragonese faction has privately hoped for exactly this—a potential successor who sees Aragón as more than a prize to be won. He speaks candidly about the internal politics, the tensions with the Neapolitan faction, and what it would take for men like him to support Juan's eventual succession. Something approaching alliance emerges.\n96-100\nA Soldier Finds His King. Years of frustration, grief for sons lost in Italian wars, and fear for Aragón's future crystallize in this moment. Pallars sees in Juan what he has desperately sought—a king who listens, who admits uncertainty, who treats Aragonese lords as partners rather than subjects. He commits personally to Juan's cause and offers to bring others from the faction into quiet conversation.\n\nShall I roll?",

      "text": "The roll was 41 - \"Grudging Respect, No Ground Given.\" So Pallars respects Juan's candor but isn't going to suddenly become an ally. He's testing, probing, not committing.\n\nWhen confronted with \"what would you do,\" he has a few options:\n1. Deflect - claim it's not his place to set policy\n2. Admit he doesn't have a perfect answer but maintain his criticism\n3. Actually propose something (withdrawal, negotiated settlement, etc.)\n\nGiven his character - a practical mountain lord, a soldier, someone who has lost family to this war - he probably has thought about this. But his \"solution\" might not be realistic either, or might involve costs he's willing to accept that others aren't.\n\nHe won't want to admit he doesn't have a good answer. But Juan has put him on the spot. A 41 roll means he's not going to suddenly open up or become an ally - he'll maintain his guarded, testing posture.\n\nLet me have him give a partial answer but not a complete one - and perhaps turn it back on Juan in some way, or reveal something about the faction's position without committing fully.\n\nNPC Analysis - Count of Pallars (continued):\n\nWhat he wants: To avoid being put on the defensive; to test whether Juan actually wants counsel or is simply scoring points\n\nWhat he won't say: That the Aragonese faction has debated this endlessly without consensus; that some want withdrawal at any cost while others merely want a king who comes home; that he doesn't have a clean answer either\n\nPallars' jaw tightens. The question has landed where Juan intended it.\n\nHe is silent for a long moment. When he speaks, his voice is quieter—harder.\n\n\"What would I do.\" He releases the chair back and moves to the window again. \"Your Majesty asks me to solve in a sentence what Alfonso has failed to solve in twelve years.\"\n\nHe stares out at the courtyard.\n\n\"I would not have started it. But that counsel comes too late by a decade.\" He turns. \"If it were mine to decide? I would negotiate. Not capitulate—negotiate. René of Anjou is not his brother. He has Provence to manage, a claim to Naples he cannot enforce alone, and less stomach for endless war than Louis had.\"\n\nHe folds his arms.\n\n\"Would he accept a white peace? No. But he might accept a partition. Alfonso keeps Calabria and Sicily. René takes Naples itself. Both claim the title, neither fights for it. It is ugly. It satisfies no one fully.\" He shrugs. \"But it stops the bleeding.\"\n\nHis eyes narrow slightly.\n\n\"Your Majesty has influence with Alfonso now. Castilian gold speaks loudly. If you counseled partition rather than total victory...\"\n\nHe lets the sentence hang, unfinished.\n\n\"But that is not what Your Majesty has done. You have sent florins and ships to help Alfonso win. So I ask again—what manner of king will you be to us?\"",

Victory? Something else?\n\nCritical Gap:\nJuan has not addressed what happens if Alfonso refuses to listen. The word \"hopefully\" signals uncertainty that Pallars will notice.\n\nD100 REACTION TABLE: Count of Pallars\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-15\nDismissive. \"Hopefully\" is the word of courtiers, not kings. Pallars has heard enough promises that depend on Alfonso's cooperation. He points out that men with actual leverage do not say \"hopefully\"—they say \"or else.\" Juan has gold; Juan has influence; Juan chooses not to use them as a condition. The conversation ends politely but coldly.\n16-30\nSkeptical Probing. Pallars seizes on the weakness: What if Alfonso does not listen? What then? Will Juan continue funding a war he counseled against? He presses for commitments Juan may not be willing to make, exposing the gap between intention and action.\n31-45\nGuarded Acknowledgment. The commitment to counsel Alfonso is noted but not celebrated. Pallars observes that counsel is easily ignored—especially by Alfonso. He asks pointed questions about Juan's route to Constantinople and whether he will truly have time to press the matter. Neither convinced nor dismissive.\n46-60\nCautious Interest. Pallars recognizes that Juan has moved from philosophy to something approaching a plan. He probes for details: When will Juan visit Alfonso? What specifically will he propose? Will he advocate for partition or merely \"conclusion\"? Testing whether the commitment has substance.\n61-70\nMeasured Approval. The willingness to counsel ending the war—and to accept partial victory—represents more than Pallars expected. He acknowledges this directly while noting that results matter more than intentions. He offers something in return: information about what conclusion the Aragonese faction could accept.\n71-80\nGenuine Engagement. Pallars sees a potential ally for the first time. He speaks more openly about the faction's position, the internal debates about Naples, and what it would take to bring the war to acceptable conclusion. He asks whether Juan would support a specific settlement—testing the depth of commitment.\n81-90\nStrategic Partnership. Juan's willingness to use his influence with Alfonso for Aragonese interests shifts the conversation fundamentally. Pallars proposes coordinating positions: what Juan will counsel, what the Aragonese faction will support, how to present a unified front to Alfonso. Common cause emerges.\n91-100\nFull Alignment. The honesty, the concrete commitment, and the acceptance of partial victory crystallize years of Pallars' frustration into hope. He commits to supporting Juan's eventual succession if Juan delivers on ending the Italian bleeding. He reveals faction thinking freely and offers active cooperation.\n\nShall I roll?",

The deference to proper channels earns respect—a king who respects Aragonese institutions may actually mean what he says about partnership. Pallars asks practical questions: how to coordinate with the regency council, what form the message should take, when it must be ready.\n71-80\nStrategic Appreciation. Pallars sees what Juan is doing—building coalition rather than acting alone. He commits to pushing the Aragonese faction to work with the regency council on a unified message.

It's better for María to be involved than excluded\n5. Juan explicitly asked Don Ramon to seek her blessing—showing respect\n6. The succession question needs addressing regardless\n\n**Factors against María consenting:**\n1. María was deeply hurt this morning—wounds don't heal in hours\n2. She asked for time to think and write to Alfonso\n3. A council meeting forces the succession issue before she's ready\n4. She may want to wait for Alfonso's response before committing\n5.

Trust was damaged; one good meeting with merchants doesn't repair it\n\n**María's character:**\n- Spent four years holding Aragón together\n- Feels treated as an instrument, not family\n- Asked Juan not to offer solutions before understanding her fears\n- Lucia was going to speak with her—has this happened?\n\nI should create a d100 table for this.\n\nFactors Influencing María's Decision:\n\nIn Favor of Consenting:\n\nDon Ramon likely reported Juan's success with the Consell de Cent—demonstrated restraint\n\nJuan explicitly routed the request through proper channels (Don Ramon, then María)\n\nA council meeting gives María authority and control over the discussion\n\nThe succession question must be addressed eventually—better managed than chaotic\n\nJuan deferred to her authority rather than making private arrangements\n\nFour to five weeks allows time to prepare properly\n\nAgainst Consenting:\n\nMaría was deeply wounded this morning—wounds don't heal in hours\n\nShe asked for time to think and to write to Alfonso first\n\nA council meeting forces the succession issue before she's ready\n\nJuan has already spoken to faction leaders and the bishop without her\n\nShe may want Alfonso's response before any formal discussions\n\nTrust was damaged; diplomatic success with merchants doesn't repair family hurt\n\nLucia was meant to speak with her—unclear if this has happened\n\nD100 TABLE: María's Response to Council Meeting Request\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-20\nRefuses. Too soon. She needs time to write to Alfonso and process her feelings. The request feels like more pressure. She suggests revisiting after Juan returns from Constantinople—months away.\n21-40\nDelays. Not no, but not now. She wants to write to Alfonso first and receive his response before any formal council discussion. Perhaps in two or three weeks, if Alfonso's reply permits.\n41-60\nConditional Consent. She will allow the council to be summoned, but with conditions: she sets the agenda, she controls the discussion, and certain topics remain off-limits until Alfonso is consulted.\n61-80\nCautious Agreement. She consents to the meeting, recognizing the necessity, but requests a private conversation with Juan first to establish boundaries and understand his intentions more fully.\n81-100\nFull Consent. The proper channel approach and the Consell de Cent success have reassured her. She agrees to summon the council and work with Juan on the agenda.\n\nShall I roll?",

Gothic spires reach toward a winter sky, and the morning light filters through high windows, casting colored shadows across ancient flagstones.\n\nThe royal party processes through the great doors: Juan and Lucia, Catalina carried by Inés, the household knights in their best doublets, Don Ramon and a contingent of Aragonese officials. The pews are full—word has spread that the King of Castile attends Mass, and Barcelona's faithful have come to see.\n\nBishop Francesc Climent Sapera waits at the altar in full vestments. He looks... different. There is something in his bearing that was not there two days ago. A straightness to the spine. A clarity in the eyes.\n\nBefore the Mass begins, Juan approaches the bishop with his request.\n\nThe old prelate listens. His expression shifts—surprise, then understanding, then something deeper.\n\n\"The fallen sons of Aragón,\" he repeats quietly. \"And their families.\"\n\nHe is silent for a moment.\n\n\"Yes. Yes, I will pray for them.\" He looks at Juan with an expression that is difficult to read. \"This is... not a prayer I expected a Castilian king to request.\"\n\nHe turns toward the altar.\n\n\"But it is a prayer that is long overdue.\"\n\nRoll: 73/100 — The Mass Resonates\n\nThe Mass itself is... remarkable.\n\nBishop Climent Sapera preaches not of politics or crowns, but of service. Of the difference between power wielded for glory and power wielded for others. He speaks of Christ washing the feet of his disciples—a king becoming a servant.\n\nHe does not mention Juan by name. He does not need to.\n\nAnd when he prays for the fallen sons—reading the names of those Barcelona families have lost in Italy, names he has clearly gathered in the night—something breaks open in the cathedral.\n\nWeeping. Not performative grief, but the raw sound of wounds finally acknowledged.\n\nAn old woman in black clutches her rosary and sobs. A grey-haired man bows his head, shoulders shaking. Somewhere near the back, a young widow holds her children close.\n\nThe prayer continues for nearly ten minutes. Name after name. Family after family.\n\nWhen it ends, the silence is profound.\n\nAfterward, as the congregation files out into the morning light, Juan notices several things:\n\nThe Count of Pallars stands near the back of the cathedral. He was not there when the Mass began. His weathered face is unreadable, but he has not left.\n\nDon Guillem de Vic hovers near the doors, looking uncertain—the Naples prayer was not what the Neapolitan faction expected from their new ally.\n\nAnd María—Queen María—stands in a side chapel, alone, a candle flickering before her.

The gesture, though well-meant, falls flat.\n11-20\nThe widow is overwhelmed. She falls to her knees, weeping uncontrollably, unable to speak. Her daughter pulls her away protectively, apologizing profusely. Catalina is frightened by the intensity.\n21-30\nGrief becomes anger. The widow stares at Juan with hollow eyes. \"Castilian gold,\" she whispers. \"Castilian gold paid for the ships that took my boy.\" She accepts no comfort. The daughter hurries her away.\n31-45\nAwkward but gentle. Catalina offers the hug, but the widow is too stunned to respond naturally. She pats Catalina's head stiffly, murmurs thanks, curtsies. The moment is kind but constrained by the gulf between them.\n46-60\nSimple grace. The widow kneels to receive Catalina's hug. She weeps quietly. \"Thank you, little one.\" She looks at Juan with exhausted gratitude—not absolution, but acknowledgment. A small moment, honestly shared.\n61-75\nSomething breaks open. Catalina hugs the widow, then says something in her toddler way that cuts through pretense. The widow laughs through her tears. Other mourners nearby draw closer. A moment of genuine human connection.\n76-85\nThe Princesita's gift. Word spreads through the cathedral—the little princess who saved the drowning boy now comforts the grieving. The widow clutches Catalina like a lifeline. Others approach, seeking the same simple grace. The moment becomes something larger.\n86-95\nCatalina speaks. Whatever she says—in her twenty-month-old wisdom—strikes something true. The widow weeps openly, holding Catalina tight. María, watching from the chapel, covers her mouth. Pallars bows his head. A cathedral holds its breath.\n96-100\nA moment that will be remembered. Catalina does something no one expects—something that will be told and retold in Barcelona for years. The widow, the watching congregation, the cynics and believers alike—all are moved. Even grief, for a moment, gives way to grace.\n\nShall I roll?",

From the side chapel, María has not moved.\n\nThe widow's daughter tugs gently at her mother's elbow, clearly hoping to escape.\n\n\"Forgive us, Your Majesty,\" she says quickly. \"My mother is... it has been a difficult morning.

The widow is overwhelmed. Juan's words are kind but the social gulf is enormous. Let me write a realistic response where the widow is touched but still overwhelmed, and the moment remains somewhat awkward but not hostile.\n\nI should not make this suddenly transform into a beautiful moment - the roll was a 4. But Juan's grace and humility can at least prevent it from becoming worse and leave the widow with something to hold onto.\n\nThe widow's hands tremble as she clutches her rosary. Up close, Juan can see the depth of the lines etched into her face—not old, but aged by grief. She might be forty. She looks sixty.\n\n\"My husband,\" she says, her voice barely a whisper. \"And my son. Both.\"\n\nThe daughter's hand tightens on her mother's arm.\n\nThe widow's eyes flicker to Catalina, still hiding her face against Juan's shoulder. Something softens in her expression—the universal recognition of a mother seeing a frightened child.\n\n\"She is beautiful,\" the widow manages. \"Your daughter. She is...\"\n\nShe cannot finish. Tears spill down her cheeks.\n\n\"Thank you, Your Majesty. For the prayers. For—\" She gestures vaguely toward the altar, toward where the bishop read the names. \"No one has... we have not heard their names spoken in church before. Not once. Not in three years.\"\n\nShe curtsies again, unsteady, clearly desperate to flee but unsure if she has permission.\n\n\"God keep Your Majesty,\" she whispers. \"And your little one. Keep her safe. Keep her...\"\n\nHer voice breaks.\n\nThe daughter steps in, supporting her mother's elbow. \"Thank you, Your Majesty,\" she says quietly, her eyes unreadable. \"We will pray for your family as well.\"\n\nIt is not warm. It is not cold. It is the response of people who do not know what to make of a king who approaches them in a cathedral—who cannot tell if this is genuine or performance, and who are too exhausted by grief to parse the difference.\n\nThey retreat toward the doors, the daughter guiding her mother with gentle hands.\n\nCatalina peeks out from Juan's shoulder, watching them go.\n\n\"Lady still sad, Papa,\" she whispers.",

I need to determine her reaction and then narrate Juan's exit.\n\nGiven the earlier context:\n- María was deeply hurt by Juan's approach yesterday\n- She set conditions on the council meeting (conditional consent, roll 56)\n- She has been crying in the side chapel during/after the Mass\n- The bishop prayed for the fallen sons of Aragón - which would be emotional for her as regent\n- She's watching Juan try to comfort the widow with Catalina\n\nHer reaction to Juan's wave - this is a small gesture. She might acknowledge it, she might not.

For a moment she does not move—a figure framed in candlelight, her face still bearing the traces of tears.\n\nThen, slowly, she inclines her head. Not a wave. Not a smile. But an acknowledgment.\n\nIt is not forgiveness. It is not warmth. But it is not the cold shoulder of yesterday either. Something has shifted—perhaps the Mass, perhaps the prayer for the fallen sons, perhaps simply time working its slow medicine.\n\nShe turns back to the candle, kneeling once more.\n\nThe cathedral doors open onto bright winter sunlight. Barcelona spreads before them, the Plaça de la Seu filled with congregants lingering after Mass, merchants setting up their stalls, children chasing pigeons across the flagstones.\n\nDon Guillem de Vic hovers near the steps, looking uncertain. When he sees Juan emerge, he straightens, clearly trying to decide whether to approach.\n\nThe Count of Pallars has slipped out a side door—Juan catches a glimpse of his grey cloak disappearing down a narrow street.\n\nLucia emerges beside Juan, shading her eyes against the sun.\n\n\"That was not what you hoped for,\" she says quietly, watching Catalina play with a loose thread on Juan's doublet. \"But it was not nothing, either.

Drums pound. Pipes wail. The crowd surges and cheers.\n\n\"Papa!\" Catalina shrieks, pointing. \"Big people! Very big people!\"\n\nShe insists on being held aloft to see better, then insists on being put down to dance, then insists on being picked up again when the dragon gegant passes too close and she loses her nerve.\n\nLucia laughs more than Juan has heard in weeks.\n\nThe Barcelonans notice their visitors. Word spreads through the crowd: the Castilian king, the one who conquered Granada, he came to our festival. Some press closer to see. Others offer sweets to the little princess. An old woman presses a ribbon into Catalina's hands—a blessing, she says, for la princesita de la cuerda.\n\nRoll: 67 — Warm Reception\n\nBy evening, half of Barcelona has seen the King of Castile dancing awkwardly to Catalan drums while his daughter rides on his shoulders, shrieking with delight.\n\nIt is not dignified. It is not regal.\n\nIt is perfect.\n\nTHE DRASSANES — January 30th\n\nThe royal shipyards smell of pitch, sawdust, and the sea.\n\nMaster shipwright Arnau Despujol walks Juan through the cavernous workspace where the ribs of three war galleys rise like the bones of great beasts. Catalan craftsmen labor with adze and saw, their movements practiced and precise.\n\n\"Thirty oars each side,\" Despujol explains, his Castilian rough but serviceable. \"Lateen sail for speed. Ram-prow reinforced with bronze.\"\n\nHe shows Juan innovations—a new method of joining planks that reduces leakage, a design for oar-locks that allows faster deployment.\n\nJuan asks questions. Detailed questions. Questions about tonnage and draft and the relative merits of nailed versus pegged construction.\n\nDespujol's initial wariness gives way to something approaching enthusiasm.\n\nRoll: 73 — Professional Respect\n\n\"Your Majesty knows ships,\" the master shipwright observes, surprised.\n\n\"I am learning,\" Juan admits. \"Castile has never been a naval power. That must change.\"\n\nDespujol considers this. \"If Your Majesty ever wishes to send shipwrights to study our methods...\" He shrugs. \"Barcelona's techniques are no secret to those who ask properly.\"\n\nLA LLOTJA — January 31st\n\nThe merchant exchange buzzes with activity—traders shouting prices, clerks scratching figures, runners dashing between stalls with messages and contracts.\n\nDon Guillem serves as guide, introducing Juan to the leading merchant families. The Gualbes. The Santcliment. The Marquet.\n\nThey are courteous. They are cautious. They watch Juan the way they watch any new factor entering their market—assessing risk and opportunity.\n\nRoll: 51 — Neutral Assessment\n\nJuan listens more than he speaks. He asks about trade routes, shipping costs, the challenges of dealing with Italian city-states. He does not promise. He does not commit. He learns.\n\nThe merchants take note. A king who listens is unusual. A king who asks about shipping costs is unprecedented.\n\n\"He is not what we expected,\" one merchant murmurs to another as Juan departs.\n\n\"No,\" his companion agrees. \"The question is whether that is good or bad.\"\n\nTHE CROSSBOW GUILD — February 1st\n\nThe guild's practice ground lies outside the city walls. Targets stand at varying distances—some stationary, some mounted on pivots to swing unpredictably.\n\nThe crossbowmen are proud men, veterans of city defense and occasional mercenary service. They eye Juan with professional skepticism.\n\n\"Does Your Majesty shoot?\" the guild master asks.\n\nRoll: 44 — Modest Performance\n\nJuan's first bolts fly true enough. He is competent—trained, as any prince must be. But the guild's champions outshoot him handily, their bolts clustering in target centers while his scatter more widely.\n\nHe takes the defeat with grace.\n\n\"I see why Barcelona's walls have never fallen,\" he observes, and the crossbowmen's skepticism softens into something warmer.\n\nCatalina, watching from a safe distance with Lucia and Inés, demands to try. She is given an unstrung practice bow to hold. She aims it at a pigeon and declares victory when it flies away.\n\nFALCONRY IN COLLSEROLA — February 2nd\n\nThe hills above Barcelona offer crisp winter air and sweeping views of the sea.\n\nThe Count of Cardona—whose son Bernat has become Catalina's reluctant playmate—hosts the hunt. Several Aragonese nobles attend, including, unexpectedly, the Count of Pallars.\n\nRoll: 62 — Civil Thaw\n\nPallars keeps his distance for most of the morning. But when Juan's falcon brings down a fine heron, the old count rides closer.\n\n\"A good kill,\" he observes. His tone is neutral—not warm, but no longer cold.\n\n\"The falcon did the work,\" Juan replies.\n\nPallars almost smiles. Almost.\n\n\"A modest king. Unusual.\"\n\nThey ride in silence for a time. Then Pallars speaks again, quietly:\n\n\"The council meets in four days. I have spoken with Don Ramon about the message to Alfonso.\" A pause. \"We are... drafting language.\"\n\nHe says nothing more. But it is more than Juan expected.\n\nTHE BOQUERIA MARKET — February 3rd\n\nCatalina is in paradise.\n\nThe market sprawls in organized chaos—fish gleaming on ice, meat hanging from hooks, pyramids of oranges and lemons, baskets of almonds and dried figs. Vendors call their wares in rapid Catalan.\n\n\"Papa! Fish! Big fish!\"\n\nShe points at a tuna nearly as large as she is.\n\n\"Papa! Bird! Dead bird!\"\n\nShe points at a row of hanging pheasants.\n\n\"Papa! Smell bad!\"\n\nShe points at the cheese stall, then covers her nose dramatically.\n\nLucia purchases honey cakes. Catalina devours two before anyone can stop her, then demands a third \"for the horse\"—meaning her wooden horse, back at the palace.\n\nThe market vendors are charmed. Word spreads. By afternoon, someone has given Catalina a small basket of candied almonds, a ribbon for her hair, and a tiny wooden cat that a craftsman carved on the spot.\n\nA LETTER ARRIVES — February 4th\n\nDon Ramon brings it personally.\n\n\"From His Majesty King Alfonso. Addressed to Her Majesty the Regent.\"\n\nMaría receives it in private. She does not share its contents immediately.\n\nBut that evening, she sends word through Don Ramon:\n\n\"Her Majesty wishes to inform His Majesty of Castile that the council meeting will proceed as planned. His Majesty's presence is... welcome.\"\n\nIt is not warmth. But the word welcome was not in her vocabulary three days ago.\n\nTHE EVE OF THE COUNCIL — February 5th\n\nThe absent members have arrived. Don Berenguer de Bardaxí, weathered and watchful. The Viscount of Rocabertí, proud and silent. The Bishop of Girona, rotund and thoughtful.\n\nBarcelona hums with tension and anticipation. Everyone knows the council meets tomorrow. Everyone knows the King of Castile will attend. Everyone wonders what will be said.\n\nLucia finds Juan in their chambers, watching the sunset over the harbor.\n\n\"Tomorrow,\" she says.\n\n\"Tomorrow,\" he agrees.\n\nCatalina sleeps in the next room, exhausted from a day of preparation—which for her meant informing Bernat that her papa would be at the council and his papa would not, a diplomatic incident that required intervention from both nursemaids.\n\n\"Are you ready?\" Lucia asks.",

She wears the regent's chain of office. Her face is composed, formal—the mask of authority.\n\n\"Your Majesty of Castile. Your Majesty.\" She inclines her head to Juan, then Lucia. \"The Council of Aragón welcomes you as honored guests.\"\n\nThe word guests carries weight.\n\nShe gestures to two chairs set slightly apart from the table—visible, included, but not of the council.\n\n\"Please. Be seated.\"\n\nDon Ramon clears his throat. \"Her Majesty the Regent has prepared an agenda for today's proceedings.\" He produces a document. \"With Your Majesty's permission?\"\n\nMaría nods.\n\n\"First: the matter of trade cooperation between the kingdoms, including the recent agreements with the Consell de Cent.

The sovereign argument proves his point—Castile does what it wants, Aragón must adapt. Others on the council shift uncomfortably. María's face darkens. The defense has become confirmation of their fears.\n16-30\nCold reception. The logic is unassailable but wins no friends. Rocabertí scoffs openly. Pallars and Bardaxí exchange glances. Don Guillem looks at the floor. Juan is technically correct and politically isolated.\n31-45\nGrudging acknowledgment, lingering suspicion. Don Ramon notes that the argument is legally sound. Rocabertí is not satisfied but has no counter. The council moves on, but the Viscount's point hangs in the air—Castile acts, Aragón reacts.\n46-60\nMixed response. Some councillors accept the logic; others remain skeptical. María intervenes to move proceedings forward before the debate escalates. The matter is neither won nor lost—tabled rather than resolved.\n61-70\nMeasured approval. Don Ramon or Pallars observes that the letter benefits Aragonese merchants—attacking it attacks their own interests. Rocabertí is isolated. The council accepts Juan's explanation without warmth but without hostility.\n71-80\nRespect earned. The direct address, the admission, the reframing—someone on the council (perhaps Bardaxí, perhaps the Bishop) notes that Juan could have evaded but chose honesty. Rocabertí's attack loses momentum.\n81-90\nThe tide turns. Juan's willingness to face the challenge directly, combined with the substance of what the letter actually contains, shifts the room. Don Guillem finds courage to speak in support. Even Pallars nods slightly.\n91-100\nRocabertí overplayed. The attack backfires—Juan's response exposes it as unreasonable.

He has shown this body respect that—\" she pauses, and something flickers in her expression, \"—that he did not owe us.

The Bishop of Girona studies his folded hands with intense concentration.\n\nRocabertí stands frozen, caught between defending himself and making things worse.\n\n\"The letter His Majesty wrote,\" María continues, \"instructs Castilian officials to treat Catalan merchants as equals. As equals.\" She looks around the table. \"Is there anyone here who wishes to object to that? Anyone who believes our merchants should be treated worse in Granada's ports?\"\n\nSilence.\n\n\"I thought not.\"\n\nShe turns to Juan. For a moment, their eyes meet. Something passes between them—not warmth, not yet, but something closer to recognition. You could have made this difficult. You didn't.\n\n\"His Majesty of Castile has answered the question satisfactorily.\" She sits, her bearing regal. \"The matter is closed. Don Ramon, proceed with the agenda.\"\n\nDon Ramon clears his throat, visibly relieved. \"The—yes. The trade agreements. Don Guillem, you may present.\"\n\nDon Guillem rises, his confidence restored. He begins outlining the Gualbes banking arrangements, but the room has shifted. Councillors who were watching Juan with suspicion now watch him with something else—curiosity, perhaps.

Will ask pointed questions when appropriate.\n\n**Bishop of Girona** - Interested in Church matters, Constantinople, Juan's relationship with Rome.\n\n**María** - Running the meeting, has Alfonso's letter, will control the flow.\n\n**Don Ramon** - Procedural, keeping things moving, recording.\n\nLet me narrate the council proceedings through the three agenda items, showing the dynamics and conflicts, and creating moments where Juan might be asked to respond or contribute.\n\nDon Guillem presents the banking agreements with renewed confidence. The Gualbes framework establishes mechanisms for joint investment, shared risk in shipping ventures, and coordinated exchange rates between Castilian and Catalan currencies.\n\n\"The potential is significant,\" Don Guillem concludes. \"Granada's trade alone could generate returns of fifteen to twenty percent annually for participating houses—both Catalan and Castilian.\"\n\nThe Bishop of Girona leans forward. \"And the Church's interests? The tithes from this new commerce—how are they to be divided between dioceses?\"\n\nDon Guillem hesitates. \"That... would require further consultation, Your Excellency.\"\n\n\"Indeed it would.\" The Bishop makes a note. \"I trust such consultation will occur before agreements are finalized.\"\n\nDon Ramon records the point. \"Her Majesty, shall we note that ecclesiastical implications require separate negotiation?\"\n\nMaría nods. \"So noted. The trade agreements are accepted in principle, pending resolution of Church matters.\" She glances at her agenda. \"The second item. Constantinople.\"\n\nNPC Analysis — The Constantinople Discussion:\n\nThe mood shifts. This is not commerce—this is war, crusade, the fate of Christendom's eastern bulwark.\n\nDon Berenguer de Bardaxí speaks for the first time. He is perhaps sixty, with a soldier's bearing and a diplomat's careful eyes.\n\n\"We have heard reports that His Majesty of Castile has committed substantial forces to Constantinople's defense. One thousand knights. Sixty thousand florins.\" He pauses. \"We have also heard that His Majesty intends to travel there personally.\"\n\nHe does not look at Juan. He addresses María.\n\n\"Aragón has interests in the eastern Mediterranean. Our merchants trade in Constantinople. Our ships sail those waters.\" His voice is measured. \"If Castile commits to a major military expedition in waters where Aragonese vessels operate, this council should understand the implications.\"\n\nThe Count of Pallars stirs. \"And the costs. Another crusade. Another war requiring gold and men.\" His eyes flicker toward Juan, then away. \"We have experience with such ventures.\"\n\nMaría turns to Juan.\n\n\"His Majesty of Castile may speak to the Constantinople matter, if he wishes.\"",

Bardaxí notes that Juan spoke of Castilian plans but not Aragonese interests. Pallars observes this sounds like Naples with better rhetoric—Castile commits, then expects others to follow. The Bishop asks pointed questions about papal authority and crusade taxation.\n16-30\nSkeptical questioning. Multiple councillors press for specifics Juan cannot provide. What happens to Catalan merchants during military operations? Who commands in Aragonese waters? The uncertainty—\"wait and see\"—is taken as evidence of insufficient planning.\n31-45\nGrudging acknowledgment, lingering concerns. The council accepts that Juan's approach is more cautious than Alfonso's, but Bardaxí presses on Aragonese merchant interests. The matter is noted without resolution.\n46-60\nMixed reception. Don Guillem sees commercial opportunity; Pallars hears echoes of Naples; Bardaxí remains focused on practical implications. María moves to narrow the discussion to specific Aragonese concerns rather than grand strategy.\n61-70\nMeasured respect. The conditional approach—especially \"I will not let my men die for a hopeless cause\"—resonates with men weary of Alfonso's endless Italian war. Pallars asks a genuine question rather than a challenge. Dialogue opens.\n71-80\nThe contrast lands. Someone—perhaps Pallars, perhaps Bardaxí—observes aloud that this is not how Alfonso approached Naples. The caution, the exit strategies, the refusal to commit blindly. The room recalibrates.\n81-90\nGenuine engagement. The council moves from suspicion to substantive discussion. What would Aragonese participation look like, if offered freely? What coordination might benefit both kingdoms? María permits expanded discussion.\n91-100\nA door opens. The honesty, the realism, and the explicit rejection of glory-seeking strikes something deep.

The eastern routes are...\" He catches the look from Pallars and trails off. \"There are commercial considerations.\"\n\nPallars' weathered face is unreadable.\n\n\"Three options,\" he repeats slowly. \"Evacuation. Repair and departure. Or war, if others commit.\" He drums his fingers on the table once. \"This is... not what I expected to hear.\"\n\nHe does not say whether that is good or bad.\n\nDon Berenguer de Bardaxí is less moved. He folds his hands before him, his soldier's eyes fixed on Juan.\n\n\"His Majesty speaks of grand strategy. Of Ottoman banners on Christian coasts.\" His voice is dry, precise. \"But I asked about Aragonese interests. Our merchants. Our ships. Our sailors.\"\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\"If Castilian warships operate in waters where Catalan trading vessels sail, what arrangements exist to prevent... confusion? If Constantinople falls while Catalan merchants are within its walls, what obligations does Castile assume? If war comes, and Castile withdraws—\" he glances at Pallars, \"—as His Majesty has wisely reserved the right to do—what happens to Aragonese subjects caught in the aftermath?\"\n\nThe Bishop of Girona nods slowly. \"And the ecclesiastical dimensions. Has His Majesty consulted with Rome regarding the reunion of the Churches? The Greeks are schismatics. Aid to Constantinople carries theological implications that—\"\n\nMaría raises a hand.\n\n\"Gentlemen.\" Her voice cuts through the crosstalk. \"His Majesty of Castile has outlined his intentions. He has not asked Aragón for troops, ships, or gold. He has not asked us to commit to anything.\"\n\nShe looks around the table.\n\n\"The question before this council is not whether we approve of Castile's expedition. It is whether Aragón has specific concerns that should be communicated—and whether any coordination might benefit our merchants and sailors who operate in those waters.\"\n\nShe turns to Juan.\n\n\"Don Berenguer raises practical questions. Does His Majesty wish to address them, or shall we note them for future discussion through proper diplomatic channels?\"",

Castilian warships will operate in the eastern Mediterranean. Catalan trading vessels sail those same waters. Wartime conditions create... misunderstandings. Ships are boarded, cargoes seized, sailors detained—sometimes by allies who mistake merchants for enemies.\" He fixes Juan with a steady gaze. \"What arrangements will His Majesty make to ensure Catalan vessels are recognized and protected, not harassed, by Castilian naval forces?\"\n\nHe raises a second finger.\n\n\"Second. Catalan merchants maintain warehouses and factors in Constantinople. If the city falls—whether to assault or to siege—those men will be trapped. Their goods will be lost. Their lives will be forfeit.\" He pauses. \"If His Majesty is present with a fleet and the city falls, does Castile accept any obligation to evacuate Aragonese subjects? Or do our merchants fend for themselves while Castilian ships carry Castilian men to safety?\"\n\nA third finger.\n\n\"Third. His Majesty wisely reserves the right to withdraw if the cause proves hopeless. Prudent.\" The word carries no warmth. \"But withdrawal takes time. If Castile decides to leave and the Ottomans close the straits, Catalan vessels may be caught between a retreating ally and an advancing enemy. What warning will His Majesty provide? What coordination, so that our ships are not left stranded while Castile sails home?\"\n\nHe lowers his hand.\n\n\"These are not challenges, Your Majesty. They are the questions any commander asks before committing his men to a theater where another power operates.\" He glances at María. \"If His Majesty can address them, this council will be better informed.

Breaking Ottoman blockades is a significant military commitment casually promised\n4. Does Juan have authority to commit his fleet to protecting Aragonese subjects?\n5. Bardaxí is a soldier—he knows promises made before campaigns often fail in execution\n6. The council may want written guarantees, not verbal assurances\n7. Some may see this as too easy, too convenient\n\nThis is a significant moment. Juan has offered concrete commitments that address Bardaxí's concerns directly.

They wanted his commitment for free. Now they have to either:\n1. Accept reciprocity (which means committing Aragonese resources)\n2. Refuse reciprocity (which looks hypocritical - they want protection but won't offer it)\n3. Claim they can't commit without Alfonso\n\nOption 3 is most likely - María will say she cannot commit Aragonese forces without the king's approval. But this creates an awkward situation because Juan just offered his commitment freely.\n \nI anticipate a strategic deflection. The council will craft a response that appears cooperative while avoiding concrete obligations, likely emphasizing the need for royal approval and further deliberation.\n\nNPC Analysis — The Council's Reaction to Reciprocity:\n\nMaría:\n\nWhat she wants: Juan's commitment without Aragonese obligation; to avoid binding Alfonso to anything\n\nWhat she won't say: That she cannot commit Aragonese ships without Alfonso's approval; that Juan has just outmaneuvered her\n\nDon Berenguer de Bardaxí:\n\nWhat he wants: Protection for Aragonese merchants without entangling Aragón in eastern wars\n\nWhat she won't say: That the logic of reciprocity is sound but inconvenient\n\nCount of Pallars:\n\nWhat he wants: To end wars, not create new commitments that could drag Aragón into another conflict\n\nWhat he won't say: That he respects the move even as it complicates things\n\nThe chamber shifts.\n\nDon Berenguer's jaw tightens almost imperceptibly. He asked for a written commitment and received one—along with a request he did not anticipate.\n\nMaría's composure holds, but something flickers behind her eyes. She glances at Don Ramon, who has stopped writing.\n\n\"His Majesty raises a fair point,\" Don Ramon says slowly, his voice carefully neutral. \"Reciprocity is... customary in such arrangements.\"\n\nThe Viscount of Rocabertí, silent since his humiliation, seizes the opening. \"Reciprocity? His Majesty asks us to commit Aragonese ships to a war in the East? After everything we have heard about the cost of foreign adventures?\"\n\nPallars raises a hand, quieting him. His weathered face is thoughtful.\n\n\"His Majesty did not ask for ships in war,\" he says quietly. \"He asked for aid in evacuation. These are different things.\" He looks at Juan. \"Though the line between them can blur when Ottoman galleys are involved.\"\n\nThe Bishop of Girona folds his hands. \"The Church's position on mutual Christian aid is clear. We are obligated to assist fellow believers in peril. But obligation in principle and obligation in treaty are...\"\n\nHe trails off.\n\nMaría sits very still. The trap is elegant—if she refuses reciprocity, she appears to want Castilian protection without offering anything in return. If she accepts, she commits Aragonese resources without Alfonso's approval.\n\n\"This council,\" she says finally, \"cannot commit the Crown of Aragón to military obligations without the King's consent.\"\n\nShe pauses.\n\n\"However.\"\n\nThe word draws every eye.\n\n\"If His Majesty is willing to sign a document pledging Castilian protection for Aragonese subjects in Constantinople...\" She chooses her words with care. \"This council can recommend to King Alfonso that Aragón offer reciprocal assistance. A recommendation is not a commitment. But it carries weight.\"\n\nDon Berenguer nods slowly. \"A letter from this council, urging His Majesty King Alfonso to formalize mutual aid in the event of Constantinople's fall. Attached to His Majesty of Castile's signed undertaking.\"\n\nMaría looks at Juan.\n\n\"Is this acceptable? Your commitment now, and our strong recommendation to the King—delivered alongside the other matters we shall communicate to him regarding this council's deliberations?\"",

      "text": "Juan is showing remarkable political sophistication here. He's identified that his original approach could put Alfonso in an awkward position - arriving with Castile already committed and a council recommendation essentially forces Alfonso's hand. This looks like pressure rather than partnership.\n\nInstead, Juan is proposing:\n1. He won't sign now\n2. He'll discuss directly with Alfonso\n3. They sign together\n4. The council can write a letter with their considerations\n\nThis demonstrates:\n- Respect for Alfonso's sovereignty\n- Understanding of the pressure dynamic\n- Willingness to wait rather than lock in advantage\n- Trust-building with both the council and Alfonso\n\nHow should the council react?\n\nMaría: This actually relieves her of a difficult position. She couldn't commit without Alfonso but was being maneuvered toward it. Juan just released her from that trap voluntarily.\n\nPallars: This is exactly what he asked for earlier - Juan consulting Alfonso rather than forcing his hand. This proves Juan meant what he said.\n\nBardaxí: His practical concerns about Aragonese merchants remain, but the approach is honorable. A soldier respects another who doesn't press unfair advantage.\n\nDon Ramon: The administrator sees clean process - two kings negotiate directly, council provides input but doesn't overstep.\n\nBishop of Girona: Proper order observed, ecclesiastical matters can be addressed when Alfonso is involved.\n\nRocabertí: Even he will struggle to find fault with this. Juan is voluntarily giving up leverage.\n\nDon Guillem: His faction wanted Castilian commitment to continue. This delays things but preserves the relationship.\n\nThe key insight is that Juan just did something unusual - he had leverage and chose not to use it. He could have pressed for commitment now and put Alfonso in a corner. Instead, he's treating this as a partnership discussion.\n\nThis should land well. Let me think about the range:\n\nSuccess factors:\n- Demonstrates respect for Alfonso's authority\n- Shows Juan meant what he said about consultation\n- Releases María from an impossible position\n- Models partnership rather than dominance\n- Addresses Bardaxí's concerns through proper channels\n\n- Consistent with Juan's stated approach throughout\n\nPotential challenges emerge that could undermine his strategic move. Some might perceive his restraint as weakness or indecision. The council's desire for quick resolution gets delayed, and skeptics like Rocabertí might still find grounds for criticism. Bardaxí's practical merchant concerns remain unaddressed for now.\n\nHowever, given the previous diplomatic breakthrough and Juan's nuanced political wisdom, this approach is likely to be well-received. The move represents a sophisticated de-escalation that builds consensus without forcing confrontation.\n\nThe chamber falls silent.\n\nMaría stares at Juan. For a long moment, her composed mask slips—not into anger or suspicion, but something closer to surprise.\n\nDon Berenguer de Bardaxí leans back in his chair. His soldier's eyes study Juan with frank reassessment.\n\n\"His Majesty of Castile,\" he says slowly, \"has just voluntarily surrendered an advantage.\"\n\nPallars makes a sound that might be a laugh, quickly suppressed. \"He has.\"\n\nDon Ramon sets down his quill. In twenty-three years of Aragonese politics, he has rarely seen a king choose not to press leverage when he had it.\n\nThe Bishop of Girona clears his throat. \"This is... an honorable approach. Two sovereigns negotiating as equals, signing together. The proper order of things.\"\n\nEven Rocabertí has nothing to say. His mouth opens, then closes. There is no angle of attack here—Juan has offered to wait, to discuss, to treat Alfonso as a partner rather than a fait accompli.\n\nMaría finds her voice.\n\n\"You would have had us in a corner.\" She says it plainly, without accusation. \"Castile committed, the council recommending, Alfonso with no graceful way to refuse.\"\n\nShe pauses.\n\n\"And you chose not to.\"\n\nThe word chose carries weight.\n\nDon Ramon gathers himself. \"Then the matter of Constantinople shall be noted as follows: His Majesty of Castile will discuss mutual protection of subjects with King Alfonso directly. This council will prepare a letter outlining our considerations and concerns for His Majesty to carry.\" He looks around the table. \"Is this acceptable?\"\n\nNods around the chamber. Even Rocabertí inclines his head, though he looks as if he has bitten something sour.\n\nMaría's eyes remain on Juan.\n\n\"The third item,\" she says quietly. \"Naples.\"\n\nThe room tenses. This is the wound that has bled Aragón for twelve years.\n\n\"Count Pallars.\" María's voice is formal. \"You indicated that you and Don Ramon have been drafting language regarding a message to the King.

The letter merely asks His Majesty to assess whether that hope remains.\"\n\nRocabertí stirs—then stops. He glances at María, remembering his earlier humiliation. Whatever he meant to say, he swallows it.\n\nDon Ramon speaks carefully. \"The draft is before the council. Do we debate the language, or the question of whether to send any message at all?\"\n\nAll eyes turn to María.\n\nShe has not moved since Pallars finished reading. Her hands rest on the table, perfectly still. Her face is porcelain—beautiful and unreadable.\n\n\"This letter asks my husband to consider abandoning his life's work.\" Her voice is quiet. \"The crown he has fought for since before our marriage.

Juan is saying the letter won't work but he'll personally assess and counsel if needed. This is somewhat what Pallars asked for before, but Juan is framing it more cautiously and conditionally.\n\nI should draft a d100 table to see how the council reacts, or I could just narrate a mixed reaction since the roll earlier was 59 (mixed reception).\n\nActually, the player is just providing information/counsel. I should show the council's reaction and let the scene continue. Let me write a mixed reaction that reflects the various perspectives in the room.\n\nNPC Analysis — The Council's Reaction:\n\nPallars:\n\nWhat he wants: To hear Juan commit to pressuring Alfonso\n\nWhat he heard: The letter won't work, but Juan will personally assess and counsel peace if things are bad—conditional, not guaranteed\n\nDon Guillem:\n\nWhat he wants: Reassurance that Naples will be won\n\nWhat he heard: Juan thinks victory is close—one year—which is hopeful, but Juan also reserves the right to counsel peace\n\nMaría:\n\nWhat she wants: To understand Juan's true position on her husband's war\n\nWhat she heard: Neither condemnation nor endorsement; pragmatic assessment\n\nThe chamber absorbs Juan's words.\n\nPallars' weathered face works through something—frustration, perhaps, or recalculation. He asked Juan once before to use his influence, and Juan declined to be a hammer. Now Juan offers the same thing in different words: I will see for myself. I will counsel if needed.\n\n\"One year.\" Pallars repeats it flatly. \"His Majesty believes the war can be won in one year.\"\n\n\"I said Alfonso believes this,\" Juan clarifies. \"I said I will assess with my own eyes.\"\n\nDon Guillem seizes on the hopeful thread. \"If the war is effectively won—if Your Majesty sees that Naples is within reach—then surely this letter becomes unnecessary. We would not ask the King to abandon victory at the threshold.\"\n\nDon Berenguer de Bardaxí shakes his head slowly. \"We have stood at the threshold before, Don Guillem. Ponza was supposed to be the threshold. The first siege of Gaeta was supposed to be the threshold.\"\n\n\"This is different—\"\n\n\"It is always different.\"\n\nMaría raises a hand, silencing them.\n\n\"His Majesty of Castile offers to assess the situation personally and to counsel the King accordingly.\" Her voice is measured, precise. \"This is more than we had before.\"\n\nShe looks at Pallars.\n\n\"Count. You have heard His Majesty. Does this change your view on the letter?\"\n\nPallars is silent for a long moment. His fingers tap once against the table.\n\n\"The letter speaks for this council. It says what we believe, what we have paid, what we fear.\" He looks at Juan. \"His Majesty's assessment and counsel are his own matter—between kings. I would not discard the letter simply because His Majesty will also speak.\"\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\"But perhaps... the letter need not travel with His Majesty. Perhaps it should go through other channels. Royal courier. So that it arrives as this council's voice, separate from whatever His Majesty chooses to say.\"\n\nDon Ramon makes a note. \"The letter sent independently. His Majesty carrying only the Constantinople considerations and the council's general regards.\"\n\nMaría looks around the table.\n\n\"Is this acceptable? The Naples letter sent by royal courier, arriving before or alongside His Majesty's visit, but not carried by his hand?\"\n\nNods around the chamber—reluctant from Don Guillem, firm from Pallars, neutral from the others.\n\n\"Then we must vote on the letter itself.\" María's voice carries the weight of the moment. \"The draft as read by Count Pallars. Those in favor of sending it to His Majesty King Alfonso?\"\n\nPallars raises his hand. Don Berenguer de Bardaxí follows. The Bishop of Girona, after a moment's hesitation, raises his. Rocabertí—surprising no one—raises his hand with evident satisfaction.\n\nDon Guillem's hand remains down. His face is pale but composed.\n\nMaría counts.\n\n\"Four in favor. One opposed.\" She pauses. \"The Regent abstains.\"\n\nDon Ramon records the vote.\n\n\"The letter will be sent.\" María's voice is quiet. \"By royal courier. Within the week.\"\n\nShe looks down at her hands for a moment. When she raises her head, her composure is intact.\n\n\"Is there any other business before this council?\"",

Let me think about what the NPCs might want to raise, or if María will simply close the proceedings.\n\nThe agenda items were:\n1. Trade cooperation - concluded\n2. Constantinople - concluded\n3. Naples - concluded\n\nMaría asked if there's any other business. Let me think about what each NPC might want:\n\n**Rocabertí:** Humiliated earlier, might want to raise something to regain face, but probably smart enough not to push his luck\n\n**Pallars:** Got what he wanted with the letter. The Mass, the reciprocity gesture, and now Juan's promise to assess Naples personally - he's been slowly warming. Probably satisfied for now.\n\n**Don Guillem:** Defeated on the Naples vote. Might want to raise something commercial to salvage the day, but probably too deflated.\n\n**Don Berenguer:** Practical soldier, got his assurances on Constantinople. Probably satisfied.\n\n**Bishop of Girona:** Had questions about ecclesiastical matters that were tabled. Might want to ensure they're addressed.\n\n**Don Ramon:** Procedural - might note items that need follow-up.\n\n**María:** Wants to close on her terms, maintain dignity after the Naples vote which essentially rebuked her husband.\n\nThe most likely outcome is that the council concludes without major new business. Perhaps a small procedural matter or the Bishop noting the church matters need follow-up. This would be a natural ending point where Juan has emerged well - not triumphant, but respected.\n\nLet me write a scene where the council wraps up, giving Juan an opportunity to make a closing gesture if he wishes.\n\nThe chamber stirs. Councillors shift in their seats, the tension of the Naples vote slowly dissipating.\n\nThe Bishop of Girona clears his throat.\n\n\"The ecclesiastical matters regarding trade—the division of tithes from new commerce. These remain unresolved.\" He glances at Don Guillem. \"I would ask that the council note this for future discussion. Before any agreements are finalized.\"\n\nDon Ramon nods, making a note. \"So noted. The Church's interests in commercial arrangements to be addressed in subsequent negotiations.\"\n\nDon Berenguer de Bardaxí straightens his papers. \"The Constantinople undertaking—the letter of considerations for His Majesty to carry. Who drafts it?\"\n\n\"I will prepare a draft for the council's review,\" Don Ramon replies. \"Her Majesty will approve the final text before it is sealed.\"\n\nMaría nods.\n\nSilence falls. The business appears concluded.\n\nThen Pallars speaks, his voice rough.\n\n\"One matter.\"\n\nThe chamber stills.\n\nThe old count does not rise. He looks at the table before him, his weathered hands flat against the oak.\n\n\"His Majesty of Castile came to this council as a guest. He accepted conditions that no sovereign was obligated to accept. He answered challenges with patience. He offered commitments and then—\" he pauses, \"—declined to press advantage when he might have.\"\n\nHe looks up, his grey eyes finding Juan.\n\n\"I have been in councils for thirty years. I have seen kings bluster and threaten and demand. I have seen precious few listen.\"\n\nHe does not smile. His face remains stern, unreadable.\n\n\"I would have the record note that the King of Castile conducted himself with honor in these proceedings.\"\n\nDon Ramon's quill scratches. The other councillors are silent—some surprised, others thoughtful.\n\nMaría watches her brother.\n\n\"Is there any other business?\" she asks again, her voice softer now.",

For what you said about the war being nearly won. It is more than some would offer.\"\n\nBefore Juan can respond, Pallars passes by.

Papa and Mama need to talk for a moment.\"\n\n\"But—\"\n\n\"You may have an almond cake after.\"\n\nCatalina considers this negotiation, finds it acceptable, and drags Inés toward the corner with the determination of a siege commander.\n\nLucia rises, crossing to Juan. Her hand finds his arm.\n\n\"The garden,\" she says quietly. \"How is she?\"\n\nJuan tells her.\n\nThe council. Pallars' unexpected words. The vote on the Naples letter. And then—the garden. María's question. Her confession that she did not know what she wanted. The tears. The laughter. The ensaïmadas.\n\nLucia listens without interrupting. Her dark eyes remain fixed on his face throughout.\n\nWhen he finishes, she is quiet for a long moment.\n\n\"She is coming tomorrow? Here?\"\n\n\"Yes. With Mallorcan pastries, apparently. For Catalina.\"\n\nLucia's lips curve—not quite a smile, but something soft.\n\n\"Good.\" She squeezes his arm. \"That is good, Juan.\"\n\nShe moves to the window, looking out at the fading afternoon light.\n\n\"She has never been asked what she wants. Thirty-four years, and no one thought to ask.\" She shakes her head slowly. \"I cannot imagine it. Even in Ferrara, even as a political piece to be moved on a board, I knew what I wanted. I wanted out. I wanted to matter to someone. I wanted...\"\n\nShe turns back to him.\n\n\"I wanted what you gave me. A partnership. A purpose that was mine to choose.\"\n\nShe crosses back to him, taking both his hands.\n\n\"María does not yet know what she wants. But you gave her something today that may be worth more than an estate or a governorship.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Permission.\" Lucia's voice is gentle. \"Permission to want something for herself. Permission to take time. Permission to find an answer that might not fit neatly into anyone's plans.\"\n\nShe leans up, kissing his cheek.\n\n\"That is not nothing, husband. That is everything.\"\n\nFrom the corner, Catalina's voice rises in triumph: \"See, Inés? The horse jumped over the WHOLE FORTRESS. Now the almond cake.\"",

She was described as being born healthy despite the traumatic birth (roll: 96/100 at birth).\n\nThe player wants a single comprehensive roll that determines if she survives childhood (typically defined as up to age 12-14 in this period).\n\nGiven:\n- She already survived a traumatic breech birth (roll 96)\n- She is described as healthy and thriving\n- She is royalty with access to better care\n- But medieval childhood was still extremely dangerous\n\nI should create a realistic d100 table that reflects:\n1. The baseline danger of medieval childhood\n2. Her healthy birth as a positive factor\n3. Royal status providing some protection\n4. But also the reality that even royal children frequently died\n\nHistorical context: Looking at royal families of this era:\n- Many kings lost multiple children in infancy/childhood\n- Isabella of Castile (historical) lost children\n- Royal families often had many children partly because so many died\n\nA realistic table might look like:\n- 1-15: Death in childhood (illness, accident, epidemic)\n- 16-25: Near-death experience but survives with lasting effects\n- 26-40: Survives but with a serious illness along the way\n- 41-100: Survives childhood\n\nThis would give roughly 15% mortality, which is actually lower than historical averages for commoners but reasonable for royalty with good care. Some might argue it should be higher.\n \nI'll refine the mortality calculation, considering her exceptional birth circumstances. Her 96/100 healthy birth suggests robust health and resilience. I'll adjust the survival odds to reflect her strong start, creating a nuanced table that balances historical risks with her individual advantages. The goal is a realistic representation that honors both the harsh realities of medieval childhood and Catalina's specific potential for survival.\n\nI understand. This is a serious matter that deserves historical realism.\n\nHistorical Context:\n\nChild mortality in 15th century Europe was devastating. Even among royalty with access to better nutrition and care:\n\nApproximately 25-30% of children died before age 5\n\nAnother 10-15% died between ages 5-15\n\nCommon causes: smallpox, measles, dysentery, plague, fevers, accidents, infected wounds\n\nRoyal children had advantages but were not immune—many kings and queens buried multiple children\n\nFactors in Catalina's Favor:\n\nBorn healthy despite traumatic breech birth (Roll: 96/100)\n\nRoyal household with access to physicians\n\nRobust and energetic temperament as described\n\nParents attentive and loving\n\nFactors Against:\n\nMedieval medicine cannot treat most childhood illnesses\n\nTravel exposes her to disease (she has already traveled extensively)\n\nNo understanding of hygiene or contagion\n\nEpidemics strike without warning or prevention\n\nD100 TABLE: Catalina's Survival to Adulthood\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-8\nDeath in early childhood (ages 2-5). Fever, pox, or epidemic claims her. The healthy birth could not protect against what medicine cannot treat.\n9-15\nDeath in later childhood (ages 6-12). Illness or accident. She lives long enough to be remembered, mourned deeply.\n16-22\nSurvives, but with permanent effects. A serious illness leaves lasting damage—scarring, weakened constitution, or other affliction that shapes her life.\n23-35\nSurvives a serious illness. A frightening episode—weeks of fever, a bout of pox—but she recovers fully.\n36-100\nSurvives childhood healthy. Fortune and constitution carry her through to adulthood.\n\nThe healthy birth roll (96) has already been factored into this table by giving her better odds than a typical medieval child. A commoner's child would face 40-50% mortality; Catalina faces roughly 15%.\n\nShall I roll?",

      "text": "Intelligence: 87 — Brilliant\nCatalina possesses an exceptional mind. She will learn to read before her fourth birthday, master Latin by eight, and by twelve will be correcting her tutors' grammar. She grasps complex political situations intuitively, remembers conversations verbatim, and asks questions that make grown men uncomfortable. Her father's advisors will learn to watch their words around her—the princess is always listening, always thinking.\n\nTemperament: 76 — Commanding\nThere is something in her bearing that makes people defer. Not arrogance—something quieter, more natural. Servants straighten when she enters a room. Other children follow her lead without being asked. She does not demand obedience; she simply assumes it, and the assumption is rarely challenged. The girl who said \"No. Catalina helping\" while holding a rope grows into a woman who expects to be obeyed because she has never experienced otherwise.\n\nSpecial Talent: 34 — Horsemanship\nBorn to the saddle. Her pony Hidalgo is only the beginning. By adolescence, she will ride with the best cavalry officers in Castile and outpace most of them. She feels the horse beneath her as an extension of herself—its moods, its limits, its potential. Hunts, tournaments, even battlefields if permitted—she is never more alive than on horseback.\n\nPiety: 7 — Indifferent\nAnd here is the shadow.\n\nCatalina will learn the prayers. She will attend Mass. She will make the correct gestures at the correct times. But faith—the burning certainty that drives her father, the quiet devotion that sustains her stepmother—does not kindle in her. God is a word, not a presence. The Church is politics dressed in vestments. She will never say this aloud, not clearly, but Juan will see it. In her eyes during prayer. In the mechanical quality of her devotions.\n\nFor a king who has built his reign on divine purpose, who stripped naked before a pope to offer everything to God, who wrestles with messianic thinking and spiritual pride—this daughter will be a particular kind of heartbreak.\n\nShe is everything he might have hoped for.\n\nExcept this.\n\nBeauty: 70 — Beautiful\nShe grows into genuine beauty—not the legendary kind that launches armadas, but the kind that draws eyes across crowded halls, that makes young nobles stammer and forget their prepared speeches. Dark hair like her mother Isabel, something of Juan's intensity in her gaze, features that soften Isabel's plainness into something striking. Poets will write verses. Ambassadors will report her beauty to foreign courts. It will be a tool she learns to use early and well.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nCatalina Trastámara — Princess of Castile, heir to the Reconquista's legacy.\n\nA brilliant, commanding, beautiful horsewoman who goes through the motions of faith without feeling its fire.\n\nHer father's daughter in so many ways.\n\nAnd not at all in the one that matters most to him.\n\nThis will create fascinating tension as she grows.

She will sing the sacred music in cathedrals, her voice rising to the vaulted ceilings, moving congregations to tears—and feel nothing of the words she sings. The beauty of the music itself captivates her, not the meaning behind it.\n\nThis creates an interesting tension: a voice that could be called divine, belonging to a soul that does not believe.\n\nLet me write this up properly for the player.\n\nCATALINA'S GIFT: VOICE\n\nRoll: 5 — Voice\n\nShe sings like an angel.\n\nIt manifests early—before her third birthday, Inés notices the child does not merely babble nursery songs but shapes them, holding notes, finding harmonies instinctively. By five, she silences rooms. By ten, cathedral choirmasters will weep to hear her and beg Juan to let her train with them.\n\nHer voice is clear as winter air, pure as spring water, with a range that spans from warm lower registers to crystalline heights that seem to touch heaven itself. She requires little training—the gift is simply there, as natural as breathing. What others labor years to achieve, she does without thinking.\n\nTHE CRUEL IRONY\n\nAnd here is the particular tragedy that Juan will come to know:\n\nHis daughter's voice is the most beautiful instrument of sacred music in Castile. When she sings the Salve Regina, grown men weep. When she lifts the Ave Maria to the vaulted ceilings of Toledo's cathedral, even hardened soldiers cross themselves and whisper of angels.\n\nAnd she feels nothing.\n\nThe music moves her—the mathematics of it, the beauty of sound itself, the way harmony resolves into consonance. But the words? The prayers? The divine presence that others sense when she sings?\n\nSilence.\n\nShe will learn to perform devotion. To close her eyes at the right moments, to let her voice catch as if overcome by spiritual transport. She is brilliant, after all, and commanding—she knows what people expect to see.\n\nBut Juan will know.\n\nA father always knows.\n\nShall we continue with María's visit tomorrow, or skip ahead toward departure for Rome?",

This is something else: a king on horseback with a small child before him, two queens riding side by side, a handful of guards trailing at a respectful distance.\n\nNo banners. No heralds. Just family.\n\nCatalina sits before Juan on Hidalgo, her small hands gripping the pommel with fierce determination. She has opinions about the correct speed of travel.\n\n\"Faster, Papa.\"\n\n\"We are in the city, cariño. We must be careful of people.\"\n\n\"But the ships.\"\n\n\"The ships will wait.\"\n\n\"What if they leave?\"\n\n\"Then we will watch other ships.\"\n\nCatalina considers this, finds it inadequate, but accepts it under protest.\n\nMaría rides beside Lucia, their horses walking abreast. The Regent sits her saddle well—the muscle memory of a noblewoman trained from childhood—but there is something stiff in her posture. The body remembers; the spirit has forgotten why it once loved this.\n\nThey pass through the Porta de Mar and the city falls away behind them. The road winds upward toward the hill of Montjuïc, the harbor spreading out below like a map painted in blue and white and the warm brown of wooden hulls.\n\nThe wind freshens, carrying salt and tar and distant places.\n\n\"There!\" Catalina points with her whole arm. \"SHIPS! Many ships!\"\n\nAnd there are. Dozens of vessels crowd the harbor—fishing boats and merchant carracks, sleek war galleys with their oars shipped, fat-bellied traders from Genoa and Venice and places beyond. The banners of a dozen nations flutter in the breeze.\n\nMaría reins up beside them, her eyes on the water.\n\n\"I used to come here as a girl,\" she says quietly. \"Before I was married. I would watch the ships and wonder where they were going.\"\n\nShe pauses.\n\n\"I never found out.\"",

Mama is coming.\"\n\n\"Will Inés come?\"\n\n\"Yes, Inés too.\"\n\n\"Will...\" She twists around to look at María, who sits her horse a few paces away, watching the exchange with an unreadable expression. \"Will Aunt María come?\"\n\nThe question hangs in the salt air.\n\nMaría's hands tighten on her reins. Her eyes meet Juan's over Catalina's head—a flash of something raw and unguarded.\n\n\"Aunt María has to stay here,\" Juan says gently. \"She has an important job. She takes care of Aragón while King Alfonso is away.\"\n\nCatalina's brow furrows.\n\n\"But who takes care of Aunt María?\"\n\nThe wind gusts. A gull cries somewhere overhead. Lucia's horse shifts beneath her.\n\nMaría looks away, toward the ships, toward the horizon, toward all the places she wondered about as a girl and never saw.\n\n\"That,\" she says quietly, \"is a very good question.\"",

Lucia catches her eye and smiles.\n\nThey find a baker in the Plaça del Pi, near the church of Santa Maria. The shop is small and warm, fragrant with sugar and butter and woodsmoke. The baker's wife nearly faints when she realizes who has entered her establishment.\n\n\"Your—Your Majesties—I—the shop is not—we are not prepared for—\"\n\n\"We would like a crostata,\" Juan says simply. \"Your largest, if you please.\"\n\nThe woman stares. Her husband emerges from the back, flour on his hands, and stares as well.\n\n\"A whole one?\" the wife manages.\n\n\"A whole one. We are very hungry.\"\n\nCatalina nods solemnly to confirm this.\n\nThe crostata is produced—golden-brown, glistening with honey, studded with almonds. It is not the refined work of a palace kitchen. It is better. It is real.\n\nJuan pays twice what it is worth. The baker's wife weeps and tries to give it back. Juan refuses. Catalina waves goodbye and tells them their shop smells \"very nice, like Inés's hair but sweeter.\"\n\nTHE PALACE — LATE AFTERNOON\n\nThey gather in María's private chambers rather than the formal apartments—smaller, warmer, less like a throne room. Cushions and chairs pulled close together. The crostata set on a table between them. No servants. No ceremony.\n\nCatalina has claimed a position on María's lap, which María accepted with an expression of stunned wonder, as if a wild bird had landed on her hand.\n\n\"You must take the first piece, Aunt María,\" Catalina instructs. \"Because you are the queen here. Then Papa, because he paid. Then Mama. Then Catalina.\" She pauses. \"Then Catalina again, if there is more.\"\n\n\"That seems fair,\" María says, her voice slightly hoarse.\n\nShe cuts the first piece. Her hands tremble only a little.\n\nThey eat. The crostata is sweet and sticky and imperfect and wonderful. Catalina gets honey on her chin, her fingers, somehow on her forehead. She chatters about ships and horses and whether fish know they are wet.\n\nAt some point, María's arm settles around Catalina's small body—not stiffly, not formally, but naturally. As if it belongs there.\n\nLucia meets Juan's eyes across the room.\n\nThis, her expression says. This is what she needed.\n\nWhen the crostata is gone—Catalina did indeed have a second piece, and a third—the little princess's energy finally fades. She slumps against María's chest, eyelids drooping.\n\n\"Aunt María?\"\n\n\"Yes, little one?\"\n\n\"You are not so sad anymore.\"\n\nMaría is quiet for a long moment. Her hand strokes Catalina's hair.\n\n\"No,\" she whispers. \"No, I am not so sad anymore.\"\n\nCatalina nods, satisfied, and falls asleep.\n\nMaría looks at Juan over the child's head. Her eyes are bright.\n\n\"Thank you,\" she mouths silently.",

Preparation for departure\n\nI should also consider rolling for how the knights are doing - their readiness, morale, etc.\n\nTHE REMAINING WEEKS — FEBRUARY 7-28, 1434\n\nThe days pass with unexpected sweetness.\n\nMaría joins them most mornings now. Not every day—she is still Regent, still bound by duties—but often enough that Catalina begins to expect her, to save the \"best\" pastries for her, to demand her presence at important events like the wooden horse's wedding to the cloth doll.\n\nThey ride twice more to Montjuïc. María races Lucia along the coastal road—and wins, laughing breathlessly, looking for a moment like the girl who once dreamed of faraway places. They visit the Drassanes again, María pointing out details of Aragonese ship construction that Juan had missed. They walk the Boqueria market together, Catalina acquiring enough ribbons and sweets to supply a small army.\n\nSomething heals.\n\nNot completely. Not perfectly. María still deflects when asked what she wants. She still stiffens sometimes when Alfonso's name arises. The question Juan asked her in the garden remains unanswered.\n\nBut she laughs now. She reaches for Catalina without hesitation. She looks at Juan and Lucia not as threats or obligations, but as family.\n\nIt is enough. For now, it is enough.\n\nTHE INSPECTION — FEBRUARY 28, 1434\n\nThe Fields Outside Barcelona\n\nSeven hundred knights in white tabards marked with the crosses of their orders—Santiago's red sword-cross, Calatrava's crimson fleur-de-lys cross, Alcántara's green cross—stand in formation on the fields beyond the city walls.\n\nThey have been assembling for weeks, arriving in groups from their commanderies across Castile and Aragón. Veterans of the Granada campaign, most of them. Men who stormed the walls of Málaga and Loja, who stood in the breach at Alhama, who watched the Sultan's banner fall over the Alhambra.\n\nNow they prepare for a longer journey. Constantinople.\n\nCaptain Fernán Alonso de Robles meets Juan at the edge of the field.\n\n\"Your Majesty.\" He bows crisply. \"The men are assembled for inspection.\"\n\nRoll for the state of the knights:\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-15\nTroubled. Supply issues, low morale, sickness in the camp. Problems need addressing.\n16-35\nAdequate. Ready, but not eager. Discipline holds, but enthusiasm is lacking.\n36-60\nGood. Well-supplied, professional, prepared. A solid force.\n61-80\nExcellent. High morale, sharp discipline, eager for the journey. Veterans proud of their purpose.\n81-95\nExceptional. These men would follow Juan into hell. The Granada campaign forged something rare.\n96-100\nLegendary. The spirit in this camp is something chroniclers will write about.\n\nShall I roll?",

This creates drama and gives the player agency to solve the issue.\n\nCaptain Robles' expression tells Juan something is wrong before they reach the first rank.\n\n\"Your Majesty should be aware...\" He pauses, choosing words carefully. \"There have been difficulties.\"\n\nThe inspection reveals the problems starkly.\n\nSickness. A fever has swept through the camp over the past week. Nearly sixty men lie in the infirmary tents, shivering under blankets. Three have died. The physicians speak of bad water from a nearby stream, or perhaps tainted provisions. The illness is not plague—thank God—but it has spread fear through the ranks.\n\nSupply Issues. A shipment of preserved meat from Valencia arrived spoiled. The replacement shipment is delayed—perhaps another week, perhaps longer. The men have food, but not the stocks needed for a long sea voyage. The quartermasters are scrambling.\n\nMorale. The waiting has worn on them. These are veterans of Granada—men who fought and won. Now they sit in muddy fields outside Barcelona while their commanders negotiate politics and their supplies rot. Rumors have spread: Constantinople is hopeless. The Greeks will betray us like they betrayed the last crusaders. We will die far from home for a city that cannot be saved.\n\nJuan walks the ranks. The men stand at attention, but he sees it in their eyes. Exhaustion. Doubt. The hollow look of soldiers who have begun to wonder if their leaders know what they are doing.\n\nA Santiago knight coughs violently as Juan passes, barely suppressing it. His face is pale, sheened with sweat. He should be in the infirmary. He is standing inspection through sheer will.\n\nCaptain Robles walks beside Juan, voice low.\n\n\"The Order commanders blame each other for the supply failures. Santiago says Calatrava's quartermaster accepted the spoiled meat without proper inspection. Calatrava says Santiago's camp placement contaminated the water. Alcántara's men feel overlooked entirely—they claim their equipment requests have been ignored.\"\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\"The men need to see leadership, Your Majesty. They need to know this expedition has purpose. Right now, they see only confusion and sickness and delay.\"\n\nThe white tabards flutter in the February wind. Seven hundred men—or six hundred and forty, with the sick—waiting for a king to tell them why they should sail to the edge of the world.\n\n\"What would Your Majesty like to do?\"",

Normalizes the hardship - \"Such is the fate of knights and soldiers\"\n5. Reminds them they've overcome this before - builds on sunk costs positively\n6.

The men are genuinely sick and hungry - words don't cure fever or fill bellies\n2. Constantinople is not Granada - it's further, stranger, more hopeless\n3. Some may feel this is just rhetoric - they've heard speeches before\n4. The supply and command problems remain unaddressed in practical terms\n5.

The speech has to work harder because of this baseline.\n \nThese veterans carry deep memories of past campaigns. Their connection to Juan runs deeper than mere words. The prayer \"Non nobis Domine\" isn't hollow rhetoric, but a battle cry etched in their collective experience from previous victories. While their current condition is dire, their shared history suggests resilience might overcome immediate challenges.\n\nApproach Quality Assessment:\n\nSuccess Factors:\n\nFull armor—Juan presents himself as a soldier among soldiers, not a distant king\n\nThe white banner—shared symbol, shared memory of Granada's victories\n\nAcknowledges current problems directly—\"tired, sick, maybe even hungry\"—does not pretend\n\nNormalizes hardship—\"Such is the fate of knights and soldiers\"\n\nReminds them they have overcome before—Granada was also hard at the beginning\n\nPractical framing—supplies will be acquired, sick will be tended, departure when ready\n\nElevates their identity—\"sons of Castile\" who go where none else dare\n\nThe Greek delegation's despair—positions them as the only hope\n\nHis father's sword—personal, dynastic, connects to legacy\n\n\"Non nobis Domine\"—the Granada prayer, their prayer, calls on shared sacred memory\n\nDoes not blame anyone for the failures—no scapegoats, no recriminations\n\nHigher purpose explicitly invoked—they serve Christ, not just a king\n\nFailure Factors:\n\nWords do not cure fever or fill empty bellies—the problems remain\n\nConstantinople is not Granada—farther, stranger, more hopeless in reputation\n\nSome men may see rhetoric where they need solutions\n\nThe Order commanders' feud is unaddressed—structural problems persist\n\nSixty men in infirmary tents—some will hear this through canvas, too sick to stand\n\nRumors of Greek treachery will not vanish from one speech\n\nThese men are veterans—they have heard speeches before, they judge by results\n\nThe sick Santiago knight swaying in ranks—courage alone cannot sustain flesh\n\nD100 REACTION TABLE: The Knights' Response\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-10\nSilence. The words land on exhausted men and sink without trace. A few voices answer \"Non nobis Domine,\" but ragged, scattered. The sick knight collapses. The men see their condition reflected in his fall. Morale does not break further, but it does not lift. They will follow orders. Nothing more.\n11-25\nGrudging acknowledgment. The response comes—\"Non nobis Domine\"—but muted, tired. The veterans remember Granada, but Constantinople feels different. Doubt lingers. The speech bought time, not belief. Juan will need to solve the practical problems quickly, or the words will curdle into resentment.\n26-40\nSteadied, not stirred. The men straighten. The prayer rises with more strength. The Granada veterans remember what this banner means. But the younger knights, the sick, the hungry—they need more than memory. The rot is halted, not healed. A foundation to build on, if Juan acts swiftly.\n41-55\nRekindled embers. Something answers in the men—pride, perhaps, or shame at their own doubt. \"Non nobis Domine\" rises with force. The sick knight remains standing through sheer will. The Order commanders glance at each other differently. The problems remain, but the spirit to face them has returned.\n56-70\nThe fire catches. The response is strong, unified. Men who were slumping stand tall. The banner snaps in the wind and they see it again—really see it, as they saw it at Granada. The feuding commanders set aside their grievances, at least for now. These men will march.\n71-85\nGranada remembered. The prayer thunders across the field. Veterans weep openly—not from despair, but from recognition. This is why they followed him. This is what they nearly forgot. The sick knight's voice rises with the rest, fever be damned. The men remember who they are.\n86-95\n\"We are the sons of Castile.\" The response shakes the air. Men pound sword hilts against shields. The infirmary tents hear it and voices rise from within—the sick joining as they can. Something has been forged anew. These men will follow Juan to Constantinople. To hell. To wherever he leads.\n96-100\nThe Spirit descends. What happens next will be spoken of for generations. The prayer becomes a roar, then a hymn, then something beyond words. Men fall to their knees not from weakness but from overwhelming purpose. The sick Santiago knight stands straighter than he has in days. This is no longer an army. It is a crusade reborn.\n\nShall I roll?",

The bleeding has stopped, but the wound remains open.\n\nCaptain Robles steps close as the prayer fades into the February wind.\n\n\"They answered, Your Majesty.\" His voice is low, meant only for Juan. \"That is something.\"\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\"But they need more than words now. They need to see the supply wagons arrive. They need to see the sick recover. They need to see that someone is solving the problems, not just acknowledging them.\"\n\nHe looks out over the ranks—the white tabards, the crosses of three Orders, the faces of men who conquered Granada and now wonder if Constantinople will be their grave.\n\n\"You have bought time, Your Majesty. Perhaps a week. Perhaps less.\" His jaw tightens. \"What would you have me do?\"\n\nFrom the edge of the field, Lucia watches. Catalina is quiet in her arms, thumb in her mouth, sensing that something did not go as hoped.\n\nThe Order commanders remain at the front of their contingents. The Santiago captain's scarred face is unreadable. The Calatrava veteran stares at the ground. The Alcántara sergeant looks at Juan with something that might be hope, might be doubt.\n\nThe white banner ripples overhead, waiting to see if it will fly over victory or failure.",

A table dominates the center, covered with supply manifests, maps, and the detritus of a troubled expedition. The canvas walls snap in the wind.\n\nJuan enters still in armor. Captain Robles follows, then the three Order commanders file in behind.\n\nThey do not sit. No one has offered, and the tension in the air does not invite comfort.\n\nNPC Analysis — The Order Commanders:\n\nCommander Rodrigo de Cervantes (Santiago) — Scarred face, forty years old, veteran of a dozen campaigns\n\nWhat he wants: To clear Santiago of blame for the camp placement; to establish his Order's primacy in the expedition hierarchy\n\nWhat he won't say: That his quartermaster did choose the camp site near the bad water; that he fears being scapegoated\n\nCommander Íñigo de Mendoza (Calatrava) — Missing two fingers, grey-bearded, proud\n\nWhat he wants: To protect his quartermaster's reputation; to ensure Calatrava receives equal honor and resources\n\nWhat he won't say: That the spoiled meat was accepted without proper inspection due to haste; that he is ashamed\n\nSergeant-Commander Vasco de Orozco (Alcántara) — Exhausted, youngest of the three, representing a smaller contingent\n\nWhat he wants: Finally to be heard; the equipment his men were promised weeks ago; respect from the larger Orders\n\nWhat he won't say: That Alcántara has considered withdrawing from the expedition entirely; that his men feel like afterthoughts\n\nCaptain Robles closes the tent flap.\n\n\"Your Majesty. Commanders.\"\n\nSilence. The three men eye each other like wolves sharing a kill—allies in name, rivals in truth.\n\nCommander Cervantes speaks first, his scarred face rigid.\n\n\"Your Majesty's speech was stirring. But speeches do not fill bellies or cure fevers.\" He pauses. \"If we are to address problems, let us begin with who created them. Calatrava's quartermaster accepted meat that a blind man could smell was rotten—\"\n\n\"Santiago's camp placement put us downstream from a tanner's waste,\" Mendoza snaps. \"My men did not poison the water. Yours did.\"\n\n\"If either of you had listened to Alcántara's concerns three weeks ago—\" Orozco begins.\n\n\"Alcántara has one hundred men,\" Cervantes cuts in. \"This is not your expedition to command.\"\n\nThe tent erupts.",

He's asking a practical question about improving care for the sick men.\n\nI need to have the commanders respond to this practical question. They should still have their own agendas and tensions, but Juan is trying to get them focused on solutions.\n\nLet me think about what each commander would say:\n\n- Cervantes (Santiago): Might know about hospitals in Barcelona, might be reluctant to admit weakness by sending men away from camp\n- Mendoza (Calatrava): Might see this as an opportunity to appear helpful, or might be defensive\n- Orozco (Alcántara): Might have useful information since he's been overlooked and possibly paying attention to details others missed\n\nCaptain Robles would likely have practical knowledge too.\n\nThe NPC guide says they shouldn't be too helpful without getting something, but Juan is asking a practical question about logistics. They can answer practically while still having their tensions simmer beneath.\n\nThe tent falls silent.\n\nThe three commanders stand rigid, their accusations still hanging in the air like smoke. But Juan's voice—sharp, commanding—has cut through the noise.\n\nCaptain Robles clears his throat.\n\n\"There is a hospital, Your Majesty. The Hospital de la Santa Creu, within the city walls. It is run by the Church—the canons of the Cathedral.\" He pauses. \"It is one of the finest in Aragón. They have tended plague victims, pilgrims, soldiers. If anyone can help our sick, they can.\"\n\nCommander Mendoza shifts his weight.\n\n\"Moving sixty men through the city... it would be visible. Public.\" His voice is careful. \"Word would spread that the expedition is weakened. That the King of Castile's knights are dying in camp before they even board ships.\"\n\n\"They are already dying in camp,\" Orozco says quietly. It is the first time anyone has acknowledged it directly. \"Three dead. More to follow if we do nothing.\"\n\nCervantes' scarred face tightens.\n\n\"Alcántara speaks truth, for once.\" He looks at Juan. \"The tents are inadequate. Cold at night, damp, no proper drainage. The physicians do what they can, but...\" He shakes his head. \"They need walls. Hearths. Clean water. Things we cannot provide in a field camp.\"\n\nRobles consults a manifest.\n\n\"If Her Majesty the Regent were to request the hospital's assistance—or if Your Majesty were to ask directly—I do not think they would refuse.

We were told to wait.\" Bitterness edges his voice. \"We waited.\"\n\nCervantes has the grace to look uncomfortable. Mendoza studies the tent wall.\n\nRobles continues, pointing to a second manifest.\n\n\"For the voyage, the situation is worse. A sea journey from Barcelona to Rome—ten days to two weeks, depending on weather. Then Rome to Naples, if Your Majesty visits King Alfonso. Then onward to Constantinople—another three weeks, perhaps a month, with stops for water and provisions.\"\n\nHe sets down the manifest.\n\n\"We need, at minimum:\n\nSalted meat: Four hundred barrels. We have sixty-three. The Valencia shipment was to provide two hundred—all spoiled. The replacement is delayed.\n\nShip's biscuit: Six hundred crates. We have four hundred. Sufficient if we resupply in Rome.\n\nDried fish: Two hundred barrels. We have one hundred twenty.\n\nWine: Eight hundred casks. We have six hundred.

But four hundred barrels for an army?\" He shakes his head. \"We would drain the city. The Consell de Cent would not thank us for emptying their storehouses.\"\n\nRobles looks at Juan.\n\n\"There are other options, Your Majesty. Tarragona has salting houses.

If their salting houses have stock, we could see barrels arriving within the week. Mallorca requires a ship, but they export preserved pork throughout the Mediterranean. Two weeks, perhaps, if winds favor us.\"\n\nHe traces the sea route with his finger.\n\n\"As for resupply along the way... yes. It is possible. Even advisable—fresh provisions keep men healthier than salt-stores alone.\"\n\nCommander Mendoza steps closer to the map, his missing fingers testament to campaigns past.\n\n\"Rome will be expensive. The papal court inflates prices for everything. But the markets there are vast—we can find what we need if we pay.\" He taps Naples. \"Here is better. Alfonso's army has established supply lines. If His Majesty is visiting the King of Aragón, we could arrange provisions in advance. Neapolitan salt pork is serviceable. Not as good as Castilian, but it keeps.\"\n\nCervantes grunts acknowledgment.\n\n\"Sicily,\" he adds, grudgingly cooperating. \"If we stop there. Messina has warehouses. Cheaper than Rome, better quality than Naples.\"\n\nCommander Orozco clears his throat.\n\n\"If we are dividing the supply burden across multiple ports... we need fewer barrels from Barcelona.\" He hesitates, then continues more confidently. \"Carry enough to reach Rome. Resupply there for Naples. Resupply in Naples for Constantinople. We stretch our coin further and reduce the risk of another spoilage.\"\n\nRobles calculates silently, lips moving.\n\n\"If we reduce our Barcelona requirement to... one hundred fifty barrels of salt meat instead of four hundred... combined with what we have...\" He nods. \"Achievable. Tarragona alone might provide that within a week.\"\n\nHe looks up at Juan.\n\n\"I can dispatch riders within the hour, Your Majesty. And send word ahead to Rome and Naples to prepare provisions for our arrival.\" A pause. \"We would need letters of credit. The Gualbes banking arrangements Don Guillem negotiated—they could facilitate payments in Rome and Naples without carrying chests of gold aboard ship.\"\n\nMendoza and Cervantes exchange a glance. For the first time since entering the tent, they are not glaring at each other.\n\n\"This could work,\" Mendoza admits.\n\n\"If we do not delay further,\" Cervantes adds. \"Every day in camp is another day for fever to spread.\"",

But Juan's ultimatum forces him to negotiate or risk losing control entirely.\n\n**Mendoza (Calatrava)** - Proud, experienced, but has the spoiled meat problem hanging over him.

Fresh water flows. Hygiene improves. The bleeding stops. Recovery begins slowly.\n41-60\nSolid gains. Hospital welcomes the sick; physicians are optimistic. María provides generously—roasted meats, good bread, Catalan delicacies. Camp conditions improve visibly. Men begin to believe.\n61-75\nStrong success. The hospital treats Juan's request as an honor. María opens stores freely—a feast arrives by evening. Fresh water, clean latrines, new drainage. The camp transforms. Morale lifts palpably.\n76-90\nRemarkable turnaround. Everything falls into place. The hospital's best physicians attend the sick. María personally oversees provisioning—Barcelona's finest for Castile's knights. The camp becomes a model of order. Men speak of their king with renewed pride.\n91-100\nBeyond expectation. The city embraces the cause. Hospital, merchants, even common citizens contribute.

The building is vast—arched cloisters, clean wards, the smell of herbs and lye soap rather than rot and despair.\n\n\"Your Majesty does us honor.\" Father Bernat bows deeply. \"The knights who conquered Granada are heroes of Christendom. How could we refuse them?\"\n\nWithin two hours, carts begin transferring the sick from the muddy camp to clean beds with fresh linens. The hospital's physicians—experienced men who have treated everything from plague to sword wounds—examine each patient with professional efficiency.\n\n\"The fever is not plague,\" the chief physician reports to Juan. \"Waterborne, likely. With rest, clean water, and proper care... most will recover. A week, perhaps two.\"\n\nThe sick Santiago knight who stood through Juan's speech is among those carried in. He grips Juan's arm as he passes.\n\n\"Non nobis Domine,\" he whispers. His voice is weak, but his eyes are clear.\n\n\"Non nobis,\" Juan replies. \"Rest now. Constantinople will wait.\"\n\nTHE PALACE — MARÍA'S RESPONSE\n\nMaría listens to Juan's request without interruption.\n\n\"You need to feed seven hundred men. Not just feed them—feast them.\" She tilts her head. \"This will cost a fortune.\"\n\n\"I will pay.\"\n\n\"You will not.\" Her voice is firm. \"These men defended Christendom at Granada. They go now to defend it at Constantinople. Aragón can spare a feast for such a cause.\"\n\nShe summons Don Ramon.\n\n\"Open the palace stores. Send word to the Boqueria—we need roasted meats, good bread, wine, fruit, whatever can be gathered by nightfall. This is not charity. This is honor.\"\n\nDon Ramon bows and departs.\n\nMaría looks at Juan.\n\n\"You are not the only one who can take care of family, brother.\"\n\nTHE CAMP — TRANSFORMATION\n\nThe afternoon becomes a blur of activity.\n\nWater: Fresh barrels arrive from the city on a train of carts—clean mountain water from Barcelona's cisterns. The contaminated stream is marked with warning posts. Men drink deeply, gratefully, for the first time in days.\n\nLatrines: Juan inspects them personally. The sight of a king examining drainage trenches spreads through the camp like wildfire. Within hours, soldiers who had grown complacent are digging new trenches, relocating the old ones downhill and away from the water supply. A Calatrava sergeant who served at Granada takes charge, organizing work parties with renewed purpose.\n\n\"If His Majesty can stand in shit,\" one knight mutters, \"so can we.\"\n\nDrainage: The camp's lowest areas—where mud has pooled and tents have grown damp—are abandoned. New positions are established on higher ground. It is hard work, but men who were listless that morning find energy they did not know they had.\n\nTHE FEAST — Evening\n\nAs the sun sets over Barcelona, carts roll into camp.\n\nRoasted pork. Lamb. Fresh bread still warm from the ovens. Wheels of Catalan cheese. Almonds and dried figs. Casks of good wine—not the thin camp stuff, but proper Aragonese red.\n\nThe men gather around fires that burn brighter than they have in weeks.\n\nThere are no speeches. No ceremony. Just food, wine, and the slowly returning warmth of men who had begun to forget what it felt like to be valued.\n\nCommander Cervantes finds Juan near one of the fires.\n\n\"The men are asking who arranged this,\" he says quietly.\n\n\"Her Majesty the Regent.\"\n\nCervantes nods slowly.\n\n\"They should know that. They should know Aragón stands with them.\"\n\nHe moves off to spread the word.\n\nNIGHT\n\nJuan returns to the palace exhausted, still wearing armor that has accumulated mud from latrine inspections and dust from supervising water deliveries.\n\nLucia meets him at the door of their chambers.\n\n\"You smell like a stable,\" she observes.\n\n\"Worse, probably.\"\n\nShe helps him remove the armor, piece by piece.\n\n\"The camp?\"\n\n\"Better. Not healed. But better.\"\n\n\"María told me what she did. The feast.\"\n\n\"She did not have to.\"\n\n\"No.\" Lucia sets aside a gauntlet. \"She wanted to.\"\n\nFrom the nursery, the sound of Catalina's voice, singing something tuneless and sweet as Inés puts her to bed.\n\n\"The commanders meet tomorrow,\" Juan says. \"They must choose a single leader.\"\n\n\"Will they?\"\n\n\"I do not know.\"\n\nLucia kisses his forehead.\n\n\"You did what you could today. More than most kings would do.\" She pulls him toward the bed. \"Tomorrow will come soon enough.\"\n\nThe camp sleeps with full bellies for the first time in weeks. The sick rest in clean hospital beds. Fresh water flows. The latrines no longer poison the stream.\n\nThe crisis is not over. But the bleeding has stopped.\n\nTomorrow, the commanders must decide who leads beneath Juan.\n\nAnd in three days, God willing, the fleet will sail.\n\nShall we proceed to the commanders' meeting the next day?",

Cook fires burn cleanly. The new latrine trenches steam in the morning chill, properly distant from the water supply. Fresh bread is being distributed—María's generosity extending into a second day.\n\nWord has spread about the king who inspected latrines. About the Regent of Aragón who opened her stores. About the sick brothers now resting in the finest hospital in Catalunya.\n\nThe men do not cheer as Juan passes. They do something better.\n\nThey stand straighter.\n\nThe command tent is the same as yesterday—cramped, utilitarian, the table still covered with manifests and maps. But the atmosphere has shifted.\n\nThe three commanders are already present when Juan arrives. They stand together—not in their separate corners as before, but clustered near the table. They have been talking.\n\nCommander Cervantes steps forward. His scarred face is unreadable, but there is something different in his bearing. The hostility of yesterday has been replaced by something more controlled.\n\n\"Your Majesty.\"\n\nHe glances at Mendoza and Orozco. Some silent communication passes between them.\n\n\"We have... conferred. As Your Majesty commanded.\" He pauses. \"It was not easy. Santiago, Calatrava, and Alcántara have proud traditions. None of us wished to kneel to another.\"\n\nMendoza speaks next, his voice gruff.\n\n\"But Your Majesty was clear. One commander. One quartermaster. Unity, or have the choice made for us.\"\n\nOrozco—the youngest, the one with the smallest contingent—clears his throat.\n\n\"We have a proposal, Your Majesty.

Let me think about what they might propose.\n\nNPC Analysis:\n- Cervantes (Santiago) - largest contingent, most pride, veteran commander, wants primacy\n- Mendoza (Calatrava) - proud, experienced, doesn't want to serve under Cervantes\n- Orozco (Alcántara) - smallest contingent, youngest, has been overlooked but now has leverage\n\nThey need to propose something that:\n1. Gives one person overall command\n2. Assigns one quartermaster\n3. Doesn't completely humiliate any of the three Orders\n\nWhat might they have negotiated?\n\nPossible outcomes:\n1. One of them as commander, another as quartermaster (splitting the roles)\n2. An external figure (like Captain Robles)\n3. A rotating command structure (unlikely, Juan wanted unity)\n4. Cervantes as commander (largest Order), Orozco's quartermaster gets the supply role (compensating Alcántara for being overlooked)\n5. Mendoza as commander with Cervantes as second\n\nLet me think about what makes sense politically:\n- Santiago (Cervantes) has the largest contingent - natural claim to leadership\n- But if Cervantes gets command, Mendoza (Calatrava) gets nothing\n- Orozco (Alcántara) has been overlooked - giving them the quartermaster role could work\n- Or they might propose Captain Robles as a neutral figure\n\nGiven the dynamics, I think they might propose:\n- Cervantes as overall commander (Santiago's size demands it)\n- Alcántara's quartermaster as unified quartermaster (compensating for being overlooked)\n- Mendoza accepting a secondary role in exchange for some other concession\n\nOr alternatively:\n- Captain Robles as commander (neutral, already serving Juan)\n- One of the Order quartermasters taking the unified supply role\n\nLet me write this scene where they present their proposal. I should NOT have Juan speak or act - only present what the commanders say and wait for the player's response.\n\nNPC Analysis — The Commanders' Negotiation:\n\nWhat they want: A solution that preserves each Order's dignity while meeting Juan's demand\n\nWhat they won't say: How much pride they had to swallow; what concessions were extracted; how close they came to failing\n\nCervantes draws a breath.\n\n\"Command should go to the man with the most experience leading combined forces.\" He pauses, and something costs him to say the next words. \"That is not me. Santiago has fought alone, gloriously—but this expedition requires coordination between Orders.\"\n\nHe turns to Mendoza.\n\nThe Calatrava commander steps forward, his grey beard jutting with suppressed pride.\n\n\"At the siege of Antequera, I served as second to the Infante Ferdinand. Three Orders under one banner. I know how it is done—the politics, the rotations, the wounded pride that must be managed.\" He meets Juan's eyes. \"I am not the youngest, nor do I command the largest contingent. But I have done this before.\"\n\nOrozco speaks next.\n\n\"Alcántara supports Commander Mendoza for overall command.\" His voice is steady. \"In exchange, the unified quartermaster position goes to our man—Sergeant Tomás de Palencia. He has served Alcántara's supply lines for eleven years. He predicted the spoiled meat. He warned about the camp placement.\" A hint of bitterness. \"No one listened.\"\n\nCervantes nods stiffly.\n\n\"Santiago concurs. Mendoza commands. Alcántara supplies.\" He folds his arms. \"I will serve as Mendoza's second. My men will follow his orders as they would follow mine.\"\n\nThe three commanders stand together—not as friends, not yet, but as men who have found a workable truce.\n\nMendoza speaks again.\n\n\"This is our proposal, Your Majesty. If it does not please you, we will accept whatever command structure you impose.\" He pauses. \"But we believe this can work.\"\n\nThe tent falls silent, waiting for Juan's verdict.",

Up close, she is even more impressive—her hull freshly caulked and painted, the Castilian lions gleaming gold against crimson. The high sterncastle rises like a small fortress. Rigging stretches overhead in a complex web that speaks of journeys across vast waters.\n\nCaptain Sotomayor meets them at the rail as they climb aboard.\n\n\"Your Majesties. Welcome to the Princesa Catalina.\" He bows, then gestures broadly at the deck. \"She completed sea trials in December. Stable in heavy swells. Handles better than any carrack I've commanded in thirty years.\"\n\nThe deck is scrubbed clean, ropes coiled with precision, brass fittings polished bright. Sailors stand at attention along the rail.\n\n\"The queen's chambers, Your Majesty.\" Sotomayor leads them toward the sterncastle. \"Fitted exactly as specified.\"\n\nHe opens a heavy oak door.\n\nThe cabin beyond is surprisingly spacious—paneled in dark wood, with windows of thick glass looking out over the stern. A bed built into the bulkhead, wide enough for two. Cushioned benches along the walls. A writing desk secured to the deck. Tapestries hang to soften the wood and muffle the creak of timber.\n\nIt was designed for Isabel. She never saw it.\n\nLucia steps inside, her hand trailing along the polished wood. Her expression is unreadable.\n\nCatalina pushes past, exploring with the fearlessness of a child.\n\n\"This is mine?\" she asks.\n\n\"This is the queen's cabin, little one,\" Sotomayor explains gently. \"For your mama.\"\n\n\"Lucia-mama,\" Catalina corrects.

The king's cabin (separate from queen's?)\n\nLet me make this immersive and historically appropriate.\n\nTHE TOUR OF THE PRINCESA CATALINA\n\nCaptain Sotomayor leads them from the queen's cabin with the pride of a man showing off his life's work.\n\nTHE KING'S CABIN\n\nAdjacent to the queen's chambers, connected by an internal door. Smaller, more functional—a soldier's space rather than a lady's retreat. A narrow bed, a desk with charts already spread across it, racks for weapons along one wall. A crucifix above the bed. Windows looking out over the wake.\n\n\"His Majesty can reach the deck in moments if needed,\" Sotomayor explains. \"And the queen's cabin without going outside.\"\n\nTHE GREAT CABIN\n\nBelow the royal chambers, spanning the width of the stern. This is where councils will be held, meals taken, decisions made. A long table dominates the space, bolted to the deck, with chairs that lock into place against the roll of the sea. Maps line the walls. Lanterns hang from brass hooks, designed to swing with the ship's motion without spilling flame.\n\n\"Room for twelve at table,\" Sotomayor notes. \"More if we squeeze.\"\n\nCatalina immediately climbs onto one of the chairs and declares herself \"Captain.\"\n\nTHE MAIN DECK\n\nThey emerge into salt air and winter sunlight. The deck stretches before them—longer than it seemed from the boat. Sailors work at tasks Juan cannot name, their movements efficient and purposeful.\n\nSotomayor points out the features:\n\n\"Three masts. Fore, main, and mizzen. Square sails on the fore and main for running before the wind, lateen on the mizzen for maneuvering.\" He gestures upward at the rigging. \"She can make eight knots in good wind. Five against it, tacking.\"\n\nCoils of rope thick as a man's arm. Barrels lashed along the rails. The great capstan for raising anchor, its bars worn smooth by generations of hands.\n\n\"Where are the cannons?\" Catalina asks loudly.\n\nSotomayor grins.\n\nTHE GUN DECK\n\nThey descend a ladder into the waist of the ship. Here the light dims, filtering through grated hatches. And here, crouching like iron beasts, are the guns.\n\n\"Twelve bombards,\" Sotomayor announces. \"Six to each side. Not the heaviest—we sacrificed weight for speed and stability—but enough to discourage pirates and punish any galley foolish enough to close with us.\"\n\nThe cannons are smaller than siege weapons, mounted on wheeled carriages that can be run out through ports in the hull. Powder kegs and shot are stored in locked compartments nearby.\n\n\"She's not a warship,\" Sotomayor clarifies. \"Not built to stand in a battle line. But she can fight if she must, and outrun what she cannot fight.\"\n\nCatalina reaches toward one of the bombards. Lucia catches her hand.\n\n\"Those are not for touching, cariño.\"\n\n\"But I want to see it boom.\"\n\n\"Perhaps when we are at sea,\" Juan's captain says diplomatically.\n\nTHE HOLD\n\nDeeper still, into the belly of the ship. Here the smell changes—bilge water, tar, the mustiness of stored provisions. Lanterns cast dancing shadows.\n\n\"Stores for three months if we must,\" Sotomayor explains. \"Water barrels here—\" he gestures at rows of casks, \"—salt meat, biscuit, dried fish. Wine. Oil. Everything a crew of eighty needs to cross any sea.\"\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\"And space for passengers. The knights will be distributed across the fleet, but we can carry fifty additional souls if needed. Not comfortable, but possible.\"\n\nThe hold is cramped, low-ceilinged. Catalina is the only one who can stand fully upright.\n\n\"It smells funny,\" she observes.\n\n\"All ships smell funny, little one,\" Sotomayor agrees. \"You get used to it.\"\n\nTHE FORECASTLE\n\nThey climb back to the deck and forward, past the mainmast, to the raised forecastle at the bow. This is the fighting platform—higher than the main deck, with wooden screens that can be raised to protect archers and crossbowmen.\n\n\"If we're boarded, this is where we make our stand,\" Sotomayor says. \"Thirty men can hold this against a hundred, with the right discipline.\"\n\nThe view from the bow is extraordinary. The harbor spreads before them, Barcelona's spires rising beyond. The sea stretches to the horizon, grey-green and endless.\n\nCatalina grips the rail, the wind whipping her dark hair.\n\n\"Where is Constanti-popple?\" she asks.\n\n\"Constantinople,\" Lucia corrects gently. \"Far away, cariño. Many days sailing. Past Rome, past Naples, past many islands.\"\n\nCatalina squints at the horizon, as if she might see it if she looks hard enough.\n\nTHE CREW\n\nSotomayor introduces his officers: the sailing master, a weathered Basque named Iñigo who has crossed to the Canaries and back; the boatswain, a barrel-chested man responsible for the rigging and deck; the ship's surgeon, a quiet Catalan who nods respectfully.\n\n\"Eighty souls, Your Majesty. Sailors, marines, gunners, officers. Every man knows his duty. Every man has sailed with me before.\"\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\"She is ready, Your Majesty. The Princesa Catalina will carry you wherever you need to go.\"\n\nLucia stands at the rail, looking back toward the city. Her hand rests on her belly—where the new child grows, still secret, still safe.\n\n\"It is a good ship,\" she says quietly.\n\nCatalina tugs at Juan's hand.\n\n\"Papa. Can we sail now?\"",

The Consell de Cent meeting where Juan signed a letter establishing equal treatment for Aragonese merchants\n4. The Count of Pallars meeting (rolled 41 - grudging respect, no ground given; then rolled 9 - frustrated disappointment)\n5. Time with Catalina in the nursery\n6. The next day - Bishop's Mass at Cathedral of Santa Eulàlia where Juan asked for prayers for fallen sons of Naples (rolled 73 - resonates)\n7. Interaction with the grieving widow (rolled 4 - Catalina loses courage)\n8. Meeting with Don Guillem de Vic\n9. Days of exploring Barcelona - Festa de Sant Pau, Drassanes, La Llotja, Crossbow Guild, Falconry, Boqueria Market\n10. Letter arrives from Alfonso (February 4)\n11. The Regency Council meeting (February 6):\n    - Rocabertí's challenge and María's rebuke (rolled 98)\n    - Constantinople discussion (rolled 59 - mixed reception)\n    - Juan's offer regarding reciprocity on Constantinople commitments\n    - Naples letter vote (4-1 in favor, María abstains)\n    - Pallars' acknowledgment of Juan's honorable conduct\n12. Private conversation with María in the garden\n13. María's visit the next day with ensaïmadas, time with Catalina\n14. The remaining weeks - María joining the family regularly\n15. Catalina's survival and traits rolls:\n    - Survival: 73 (survives childhood)\n    - Intelligence: 87 (Brilliant)\n    - Temperament: 76 (Commanding)\n    - Special Talent: 34 → 5 (Voice - singing)\n    - Piety: 7 (Indifferent)\n    - Beauty: 70 (Beautiful)\n\nI notice Catalina's traits reveal a complex personality. The military and administrative aspects continue with Juan's leadership challenges. He inspects 700 knights with mixed results, delivering a speech that receives only grudging acknowledgment. Despite initial troubles, Juan successfully addresses camp issues, ultimately achieving a unified command structure through strategic interventions.\n\nThe naval preparations advance with a fleet inspection involving Lucia and Catalina, setting the stage for departure on March 5, 1434.\n\nCreate File: Creating Chapter 2.16 summary document with all events from the Barcelona visit and preparations for departure\n\nThought process\n\nThe file has been created. Now I need to copy it to the outputs directory so the user can access it.\n\nThe file has been successfully created and copied to the outputs directory. Let me provide the user with the link and wrap up the chapter.\n\nCHAPTER 2.16 COMPLETE\n\nThe summary document has been created: View Chapter 2.16 Summary\n\nThe sun sets over Barcelona harbor as Juan, Lucia, and Catalina return to shore. The Princesa Catalina rides at anchor behind them, waiting for March 5th.\n\nFour days remain.\n\nThe sick rest in hospital beds. The knights eat well and drink clean water. The commanders have found unity. The supplies are coming. María has found something she thought lost forever.\n\nAnd somewhere in the great cabin of the flagship, charts already show the route: Barcelona to Rome. Rome to Naples. Naples to Constantinople.\n\nThe edge of the world awaits.\n\nWhat an extraordinary chapter, Sicco.\n\nFrom the political triumph at the Consell de Cent to the painful meeting with Pallars, from María's tears in the garden to Catalina's fierce declaration that \"family gets hugs\"—this chapter wove together statecraft and family in ways that felt deeply human.\n\nAnd Catalina herself—brilliant, commanding, beautiful, with the voice of an angel and no faith to give those songs meaning. What a character to watch grow. What a tension to explore with Juan, who built everything on divine purpose.\n\nThe camp crisis was a perfect reminder that kings must solve problems, not just inspire. And the fleet inspection brought it full circle—the ship named for a princess, originally built for a queen who never lived to see it.\n\nReady for Rome when you are.",
