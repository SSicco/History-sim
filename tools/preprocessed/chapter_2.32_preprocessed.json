Let me search project knowledge for the financial summary from chapter 2.31 which contains the treasury position.\n\nI now have a comprehensive picture of the situation. Let me provide a short introduction for Chapter 2.32. The key details:\n\n1. It is now Winter 1434/35\n2. Juan is in Toledo with his family (Lucia, Catalina ~3 years old, Fernando ~1.5 years, and newborn Bianca)\n3. Treasury is healthy at 502,237 florins (end of 1434)\n4. Key upcoming events:\n   - King Duarte's visit - Early Spring 1435\n   - Meeting with Sultan Murad II at Tenedos - Spring 1435\n   - First settler convoy to Constantinople - Spring 1435\n   - Barbarigo (Venetian glass master) expected to arrive via smuggling route\n\n5. Recent developments from chapters 2.29-2.31:\n   - Isaac de Baeza established as secret spymaster\n   - Demetrios Komnenos recruited as shadow guardian (en route from Venice)\n   - Arms workshops established in Bilbao (German masters)\n   - Glass workshop secretly being set up in Burgos (awaiting Barbarigo)\n   - Textile workshop established in Segovia (limited quality)\n   - Paper mill recruitment failed\n   - Naval development plan approved\n   - Henry the Navigator visited, shared caravel designs\n   - Portuguese diplomatic breakthrough\n\nI should provide a short, atmospheric introduction about winter 1434/35 in Toledo without advancing the timeline, as the user requested.\n\nI now have a comprehensive picture. Let me provide the introduction for Chapter 2.32.\n\nChapter 2.32: The Waiting Season\n\nWinter 1434/35 — Toledo\n\nThe cold months have settled over Castile like a wool blanket drawn tight against the world. Snow dusts the Sierra de Gredos to the north, and ice forms nightly on the fountains of the Alcázar. Toledo's ancient streets grow quiet after vespers, its inhabitants retreating to hearths and braziers as the short days darken early.\n\nFor Juan II, this is a season of patient investment—the unglamorous work of building foundations while waiting for seeds to sprout.\n\nThe Current State of Affairs:\n\nThe Royal Family is united in Toledo for the first time in years: Lucia (now Queen), Catalina (nearly three, speaking an endearing jumble of Castilian, Portuguese, and Italian), Fernando (sixteen months, walking now and getting into everything), and baby Bianca (three months old, a calm infant unlike her older siblings).\n\nThe Treasury stands at approximately 502,237 florins—healthy, with projections to exceed one million by 1438 if current programs continue. The naval reserve of 200,000 florins remains untouched.\n\nIndustrial Development proceeds: Heinrich Steinmann's German armorers are establishing their workshops in Bilbao, the modest textile operation functions in Segovia, and somewhere on a circuitous route from Venice through Ragusa-Ancona-Genoa-Bilbao, Alessandro Barbarigo—the Murano glass master whose son Venice \"disappeared\"—makes his way toward a new life in Burgos.\n\nIsaac de Baeza's network continues expanding. Demetrios Komnenos, the shadow guardian recruited from Venice, should arrive any week now.\n\nWhat Awaits in Spring:\n\nKing Duarte I of Portugal plans to visit Toledo in early spring—a family visit to see his niece Catalina, though surely political matters will arise.\n\nThe meeting with Sultan Murad II at Tenedos is scheduled for spring—the most consequential diplomatic encounter of Juan's reign.\n\nThe first settler convoy to Constantinople must depart before summer winds make the voyage more difficult.\n\nThe fire crackles in the hearth of the private solar. Outside, a January wind rattles the shutters. Lucia sits nearby with embroidery while Catalina plays on the floor with her collection of wooden blocks—she has been sorting them by color lately, a new fascination. Fernando naps in the nursery with his wet nurse. Bianca sleeps in her cradle by the fire.\n\nÁlvaro de Luna is expected shortly to discuss the week's business. Diego de Daza has sent word that there are matters requiring attention regarding the infrastructure program. And there are dispatches from Isaac—always dispatches from Isaac now.\n\nThe kingdom turns slowly toward spring, and everything you have built waits to be tested.\n\nWhat would you like to address, Your Majesty?",

He is dressed as always in the sober dark wool of a prosperous merchant, unremarkable in every way. Only his eyes betray the sharp mind behind the forgettable face.\n\nHe glances briefly at Lucia and the children, then approaches and speaks in a voice pitched for Juan's ears alone.\n\n\"Guardian, Your Majesty. Not assassin.\" A faint smile. \"An important distinction—for his pride, if nothing else. Demetrios Komnenos does not murder for coin. He... prevents murders. Usually by ensuring those who might attempt them understand the consequences.\"\n\nIsaac draws a folded paper from his sleeve.\n\n\"He arrived three days ago. I have kept him at a house in the judería while assessing him personally. The Venetians trained him well—twenty years in the service of the Council of Ten, protecting those the Republic wished protected and... discouraging those who threatened them.\"\n\nHe pauses, choosing his next words carefully.\n\n\"He is not young. Forty-three years. But still dangerous—I watched him move, and I would not wish to face him even now. More importantly, he is intelligent. He understands that protecting a king is not merely standing between the king and a blade. It is knowing where the blades are before they are drawn.\"\n\nIsaac tilts his head slightly.\n\n\"He is ready to be presented whenever Your Majesty wishes. Though I would suggest a private introduction first. He has... a manner about him. Direct. Greeks of Constantinople do not bow and scrape as Castilians expect. He will serve you unto death, but he will not flatter you. If that will offend, better to know now.\"\n\nHe waits, dark eyes watching Juan's reaction.",

Isaac's reaction to the assignment\n2. Demetrios's arrival and presentation\n3. His character - direct, professional, Greek pride\n4. The moment of accepting the charge\n\nThis is a dialogue/conversation scene, so I should keep it SHORT (2-4 paragraphs per response) and stop to let the player respond to Demetrios.\n\nIsaac's eyebrows rise slightly—a rare display of surprise from the spymaster.\n\n\"The family. Not yourself.\"\n\nIt is not a question, but there is something in his tone that suggests he had expected differently. After a moment, he inclines his head.\n\n\"A wise choice, in truth. You are surrounded by guards, by soldiers, by men who would die for you. The Queen and the children... they are softer targets. And you have enemies who might calculate that striking at them wounds you more deeply than any blade to your own flesh.\"\n\nHe tucks the paper back into his sleeve. \"I will send for him.

No towering brute, no scarred giant. Demetrios Komnenos is of medium height, lean, with the weathered olive skin of the Eastern Mediterranean and gray threading through dark hair cropped short in the practical manner of soldiers. He moves with an economy that speaks of a body trained to waste nothing—no excess motion, no unnecessary sound.\n\nHis face is composed, watchful. Dark eyes take in the room in a single sweep—the windows, the doors, Lucia and the children, the placement of furniture, the shadows where a man might hide. Only then do they settle on Juan.\n\nHe does not bow deeply as a Castilian courtier would. Instead, he offers a measured inclination of the head—respect without servility.\n\n\"Your Majesty.\" His Castilian is accented but clear, learned well. \"Isaac de Baeza tells me you have need of my skills.

      "text": "Juan is being very direct and honest with Demetrios, explaining his vulnerability and his need. This is a character-defining moment - Juan is admitting weakness to a stranger, which shows both his honesty and his trust in Isaac's judgment.\n\nDemetrios is a Greek from Constantinople, trained by Venice's Council of Ten for twenty years. He's 43, experienced, intelligent, and direct. He doesn't flatter. He's seen the shadow world Juan is describing firsthand.\n\nHow would Demetrios respond to this? He would:\n1. Assess Juan - is this king genuine or performing?\n2. Appreciate the directness - Greeks of his background would respect honesty over courtly games\n3. Give an honest answer about his capabilities\n4. Perhaps probe to understand what Juan truly wants\n\nHe wouldn't immediately pledge undying loyalty - that would be too easy. He'd want to understand the situation, the threats, what's expected. He's a professional.\n\nLet me write his response in character - direct, professional, slightly probing, but with underlying respect for Juan's honesty.\n\nDemetrios grips Juan's hand firmly—a soldier's grip, callused and sure. His expression shifts subtly at the gesture; kings do not typically shake hands with hired men. He releases after a moment and studies Juan's face with those watchful dark eyes.\n\n\"I know who you are,\" he says. \"The Defensor Romaniae. The king who completed the Reconquista in two years when his ancestors failed for seven centuries. The man who walked into Constantinople with seven hundred knights and somehow convinced the Emperor to name him protector of an empire he cannot possibly defend.\"\n\nThere is no flattery in the words—merely assessment.\n\n\"I also know you nearly died there. The plots you sensed but could not see? I could name three that were in motion during your visit. Two from within the palace. One from... elsewhere.\" He does not elaborate. \"You survived because you left before they ripened. And because God favors fools and honest men, and you appear to be both.\"\n\nA ghost of something—not quite a smile—passes across his weathered face.\n\n\"You ask if I am the man you need.\"\n\nHe glances toward Lucia and the children. Catalina has stopped playing with her blocks and watches the stranger with the unblinking curiosity of the very young. Lucia's hand has stilled on her embroidery.\n\n\"I cannot make your family safe, Your Majesty. No one can promise that. What I can do is make them dangerous to threaten. I know how shadow wars are fought—the poisons, the hired blades, the servants who report to other masters, the gifts that carry death inside them. I know because I spent twenty years in that world.\"\n\nHe turns back to Juan.\n\n\"You are an honorable man. I see this. You fight enemies who stand before you. But you have made enemies who do not stand before anyone—they work through others, through patience, through the slow insertion of a knife you never see coming.\"\n\nHis voice hardens slightly.\n\n\"If you give your family into my keeping, I will need authority. To question servants. To inspect gifts. To be suspicious of everyone, including men you trust. This will make me hated in your household. Can you accept that?\"",

      "text": "Juan is introducing Demetrios to his daughter Catalina, who is nearly three years old. This is a sweet family moment where Juan is establishing Demetrios's authority with his children. I need to narrate Catalina's response - she's a toddler, nearly 3, who has been established as precocious, curious, and somewhat imperious in the way of young children. She speaks a mix of Castilian, Portuguese, and Italian.\n\nI should have Catalina react in a way that's authentic to a nearly-three-year-old - curious, perhaps a bit wary of this stranger, but also potentially accepting if her father says so. I should also show Demetrios's reaction to being introduced to his new charge in this way.\n\nLucia should also have some reaction - this is her family's new shadow guardian being introduced.\n\nCatalina looks up from her blocks, studying the stranger with the solemn intensity that only small children possess. She has her mother Isabel's eyes—though she will never know it—and they fix on Demetrios with neither fear nor warmth. Simply... assessment.\n\n\"De-mee-tree-os,\" she sounds out carefully, frowning at the unfamiliar syllables. Then, with the imperiousness of a princess who has never known a world where her commands are not obeyed: \"Why?\"\n\nLucia sets down her embroidery, watching the exchange with quiet attention. Her hand moves instinctively toward the cradle where Bianca sleeps.\n\nDemetrios, to his credit, does not smile condescendingly or speak to the child as if she were simple. He lowers himself to one knee—bringing his eyes level with hers—and regards her with the same seriousness she has shown him.\n\n\"Because there are people in the world who might wish to hurt you or your family,\" he says simply. \"And it is my task to make certain they cannot.\"\n\nCatalina considers this for a long moment. Then she holds up a red wooden block.\n\n\"You can have this one,\" she announces. \"But not the blue ones. The blue ones are mine.\"\n\nSomething shifts in the Greek's weathered face—a softening around the eyes that suggests this hard man is not entirely made of stone.\n\n\"I will guard it well, Highness,\" he says, accepting the block with the gravity of a man receiving a holy relic.\n\nHe rises and turns to Lucia, offering her the same measured bow he gave Juan.\n\n\"Your Majesty.

Isaac does the same, though his expression suggests he had perhaps expected this moment—or hoped for it.\n\nOnce the Greek has been shown to quarters near the royal family's chambers and has had time to walk the Alcázar's corridors—studying, always studying—Juan summons him privately.\n\nAt the question, Demetrios does not flinch. He has been asked such things before.\n\n\"You honor me by asking directly,\" he says. \"Most men do not wish to hear the answer.\"\n\nHe moves to the window, glancing out at the courtyard below, then turns back.\n\n\"The Queen. Three methods present themselves immediately.\"\n\nHe raises one finger.\n\n\"First: the food. Your kitchens are large, your servants numerous. How many hands touch a dish between fire and table? A cook, an under-cook, a servant who carries it, another who presents it. Any one of them could be bought or threatened. Poison need not kill quickly—the slow poisons are better. A little each day, and within a month she sickens. Within two, she dies. The physicians call it fever, or weakness of the blood. No one suspects.\"\n\nA second finger.\n\n\"Second: the women. The Queen has ladies who attend her, who dress her, who bring her wine when she is thirsty. How well do you know them? Who are their families? Their debts? Their lovers? A lady-in-waiting with a brother who owes money to the wrong people... she becomes a weapon without even knowing it.\"\n\nA third finger.\n\n\"Third: the children. The Queen is a mother. If Catalina wanders toward an open window, the Queen will rush to catch her. If Fernando toddles toward a staircase, she will throw herself after him. You need not poison the Queen if you can arrange for her to fall.\"\n\nHe lowers his hand.\n\n\"These are the simple methods. I have not spoken of the gifts that arrive from foreign courts—the perfumed gloves, the ornamental boxes. Nor of the physicians who might be summoned if she takes ill. Nor of the wet nurse who feeds your son.\"\n\nHis dark eyes hold Juan's steadily.\n\n\"I do not say these things to frighten you, Your Majesty. I say them so you understand: I must be suspicious of everything. The servants, the food, the gifts, theRoutines. I will make enemies in your household. The Queen's ladies will despise me.

This is a practical question about cooperation between the new shadow guardian and the spymaster.\n\nDemetrios should respond thoughtfully. He's a professional - he understands the value of intelligence networks. But he's also Greek, from Constantinople, and Isaac is a converso Jew running a spy network. There might be some professional considerations about how they divide responsibilities.\n\nLet me think about what Demetrios would say:\n1. He would acknowledge Isaac's value - intelligence is crucial for protection\n2. He might want to clarify roles - Isaac gathers information externally, Demetrios focuses on immediate physical security and household security\n3. He's professional enough to work with anyone who's competent\n4. He might have observations about Isaac already\n\nI should have Demetrios respond, and perhaps Isaac as well since he's likely still present or nearby. This is a good moment for these two shadow operatives to establish their working relationship.\n\nDemetrios glances toward Isaac, who has remained in the room—a shadow against the wall, watching the exchange with those dark, unreadable eyes.\n\n\"The spymaster and I have already spoken,\" Demetrios says. \"At length. He is... competent.\"\n\nFrom Demetrios, this appears to be high praise.\n\nIsaac steps forward, a faint smile playing at the corner of his mouth. \"Such flattery. I shall have to write it down for posterity.\"\n\nThe Greek ignores the jest. \"Our roles are different but complementary. Isaac watches the world beyond these walls—the courts of foreign princes, the whispers in Venice and Rome, the movements of men who might wish Castile harm. He will know of threats before they arrive at your door.\"\n\nHe gestures to himself. \"I watch the world within. The household. The servants. The routines. The small things that seem innocent until they are not. When Isaac tells me that a certain Venetian merchant has arrived in Toledo asking questions, I will know to watch for new faces among the kitchen staff.\"\n\nIsaac nods. \"We have already begun sharing information. Demetrios has identified several... vulnerabilities in the Alcázar's arrangements that I confess I had not considered. The passages behind the walls, for instance. Who knows of them? Who has keys?\"\n\n\"Too many,\" Demetrios says flatly. \"This will change.\"\n\nHe turns back to Juan.\n\n\"We can work together, yes. The question is whether your court can tolerate two suspicious men asking uncomfortable questions.\" A pause. \"Isaac tells me you have enemies even among those who smile at you. Great lords who lost influence when you rose. Men who served the Infantes. We will find them. But it will take time.\"",

Even low rolls shouldn't be failures - he's been putting in the work consistently. The question is just how well his body responded.\n\nLet me draft a table:\n\n1-10: Modest Improvement\n- Noticeable gains in endurance and strength\n- Can wear armor longer without fatigue\n- Poleaxe technique solid but still developing\n- Body has adapted but not transformed\n\n11-30: Solid Development\n- Clear improvement in muscle mass and definition\n- Significantly better endurance in armor\n- Poleaxe becoming natural extension of arm\n\n- Guards and trainers notice the difference\n\nThe training reveals subtle yet meaningful physical changes. Trainers observe Juan's growing comfort with the poleaxe, his movements becoming more fluid and purposeful. His muscular development shows promise, with increased strength and stamina emerging from dedicated practice. The constant armor wear is paying dividends, building resilience and conditioning his body for extended combat scenarios.\n\nKnights begin acknowledging Juan's potential, noting his impressive progression. His technique transforms from awkward to calculated, with each training session revealing greater mastery. The physical transformation becomes evident - not just in muscle, but in confidence and precision of movement. His body adapts remarkably, responding to the rigorous training with accelerating skill development.\n\nThe progression suggests a trajectory of exceptional martial capability. Juan's potential extends beyond mere physical conditioning, demonstrating an innate aptitude for warrior skills. His poleaxe technique evolves from basic competence to genuine threat, with knights quietly recognizing his emerging prowess.\n\nThe approach seems balanced, tracking potential outcomes across different stages of training. Low and high-end results remain possible, but the middle range appears most probable - reflecting realistic expectations of human physical and martial development.\n\nD100 TABLE: PHYSICAL TRAINING RESULTS (Summer-Winter 1434)\n\nContext: Juan has been training consistently for 4-6 months—poleaxe work with Sancho de Ávila, wearing armor daily to condition his body, developing cavalry techniques. He is in his early thirties, already a competent warrior from the Granada campaigns, with good nutrition and expert instruction. The question is not whether he improved, but how much.\n\nRoll\nResult\n1-10\nModest Improvement. The body resists. Perhaps age, perhaps the demands of kingship stealing sleep and focus. Noticeable gains in endurance, armor feels somewhat lighter than before, poleaxe technique solid but still requires concentration. Trainers note progress but not transformation.\n11-30\nSolid Development. The work shows. Clearer muscle definition, better wind, can spar longer without exhaustion. Armor that once felt burdensome now sits more naturally. Poleaxe becoming familiar rather than foreign. Guards notice the king moves differently.\n31-50\nStrong Progress. Substantial improvement across all measures. Extended periods in full armor no longer drain him. Poleaxe technique increasingly instinctive—Sancho has to work harder to find openings. Physical presence subtly more imposing. The foundation of a dangerous fighter.\n51-70\nExcellent Results. The training has paid off handsomely. Impressive gains in both strength and endurance. Armor feels like a second skin. Poleaxe work genuinely threatening—quick, precise, with power behind it. Knights who spar with the king must take him seriously now.\n71-85\nRemarkable Transformation. Body has responded exceptionally well. Endurance rivals professional soldiers half his age. Poleaxe technique approaching mastery—fluid combinations, excellent footwork, instinctive responses. Physical transformation visible to all who knew him before.\n86-95\nOutstanding Achievement. Near-optimal results for a man of his age and station. Can match most knights in sustained combat. Poleaxe skills formidable—Sancho admits the king could hold his own against all but the finest warriors. A genuinely dangerous man in battle.\n96-100\nExtraordinary Results. The king's body has taken to this regimen as if born for it. Exceptional conditioning—tireless in armor, powerful, quick. Poleaxe technique masterful. Sancho de Ávila tells others he has rarely trained a more dedicated or capable student. Juan has become not merely competent but lethal.\n\nReady to roll when you are, Your Majesty.",

Hesitated. You still think—but now your body moves while you think.

He can train for hours, attend to business, train again. The bone-deep exhaustion that plagued him in the early weeks has faded.\n\nStrength: Not the bulk of a tournament champion, but functional power—the kind that matters when a poleaxe must be controlled through a long engagement. His strikes carry weight now.\n\nTechnique: The poleaxe is becoming familiar rather than foreign. The basic combinations—thrust, hook, hammer-strike—flow more naturally. Sancho still finds openings, still scores hits, but he has to work for them now.\n\nPresence: Guards and courtiers have noticed. The king moves differently. Sits differently. There is a physicality to him that was not there before—not threatening, exactly, but present.\n\n\"Another six months,\" Sancho says, retrieving his practice weapon, \"and you will be genuinely dangerous to anyone who isn't a master.

      "text": "Actually, looking at the summaries more carefully:\n- Chapter 2.30 mentions \"King Duarte\" visiting in early Spring 1435\n- But the Character Database mentions King João I attending the Te Deum in April 1433\n\nWait, there's a timeline issue here. João I of Portugal was king until 1433 historically, and Duarte succeeded him. Let me check the summaries again...\n\nFrom Chapter 2.30 summary: \"King Duarte expressed desire to visit Toledo in early spring 1435\" - this suggests Duarte is now king.\n\nFrom Chapter 2.28: \"King Duarte wrote that the gift 'undone' him\" - this also references Duarte as king.\n\nSo it appears that in the campaign timeline, João I has died (historically he died August 14, 1433) and Duarte is now King of Portugal. The campaign is now in early 1435, so this makes sense.\n\nLet me write the Christmas celebration and Duarte's arrival scene, keeping it relatively brief for Christmas and setting up the Portuguese visit properly.\n\nCHRISTMAS 1434 — Toledo\n\nThe feast of Christ's birth brings warmth to the cold Alcázar. Boughs of holly and ivy deck the great hall, candles burn in every window, and the kitchens labor for days to produce a feast worthy of a victorious king.\n\nFor Juan, it is the first true family Christmas—Lucia beside him, Catalina old enough now to understand the excitement if not the theology, Fernando toddling about in the new shoes he received as a gift, and Bianca passed from arm to arm among the ladies who coo over her.\n\nMass at the cathedral is solemn and beautiful. The Archbishop speaks of light entering the darkness, of hope born in humble circumstances. Juan finds himself thinking of Constantinople—of walls that still stand, of settlers who will soon sail east, of a Sultan he has yet to meet.\n\nCatalina receives a carved wooden horse that she immediately names \"Hidalgo\" after her father's destrier. Fernando receives a ball he cannot stop throwing. Lucia receives a pearl necklace from the treasury, and if her eyes grow moist when Juan clasps it around her neck, neither mentions it.\n\nDemetrios stands in the shadows throughout, watching. Always watching.\n\nEARLY FEBRUARY 1435 — The Portuguese Arrival\n\nWord comes in late January: King Duarte I of Portugal rides north with Queen Leonor and a modest retinue. Not a state visit—he was explicit about this. A family visit. An uncle coming to meet his niece.\n\nBut kings are never simply uncles, and even family visits carry weight.\n\nThey arrive on a gray February morning, perhaps forty riders bearing the Portuguese arms. Duarte himself is a scholarly-looking man of forty-three, with the same quiet intelligence that marked his sister Isabel. He has ruled Portugal for less than two years since old João's death, and the crown still sits uncertainly on his brow.\n\nQueen Leonor rides beside him—a striking woman, daughter of the King of Aragon, which makes the web of Iberian royal marriages even more tangled.\n\nJuan waits in the courtyard with Lucia and the children. Catalina has been scrubbed and dressed in her finest, with strict instructions to curtsey properly. She clutches her wooden horse and eyes the approaching riders with suspicion.\n\nDuarte dismounts and approaches. His eyes find Catalina first—searching, perhaps, for traces of the sister he lost.\n\n\"Juan,\" he says, his voice thick with something unspoken. \"Brother.\"",

This is historically accurate - João I died in August 1433.\n\nDuarte is seeing his niece Catalina for the first time - the daughter of his sister Isabel who died in childbirth. This is an emotional moment. He's also meeting:\n- Lucia (Juan's new wife)\n- Fernando (Isabel's son, about 16-17 months old now)\n- Bianca (Juan and Lucia's daughter, about 4-5 months old)\n\nActually wait - let me recalculate Fernando's age:\n- Fernando was born in September 1433 (from Chapter 2.12 mentions the baptism in October 1433)\n- It's now February 1435\n- So Fernando is about 16-17 months old\n\nAnd Catalina:\n- Born January 28, 1432\n- Now February 1435\n- So she's just turned 3 years old\n\nThis is a deeply emotional moment for Duarte. \n\nI anticipate a profound personal encounter, fraught with complex emotions. Duarte will likely be overwhelmed by memories of his beloved sister, seeing her children who now represent her living legacy. His scholarly nature will blend with deep familial grief, creating a nuanced interaction where dignity meets raw emotional vulnerability.\n\nDuarte's composure wavers at Juan's words. He steps closer, his eyes fixed on the small girl clutching the wooden horse. For a long moment, he simply stares.\n\n\"Meu Deus,\" he breathes. \"She does. The eyes. The shape of the face. Even the way she holds herself—Isabel stood just so when she was uncertain of strangers.\"\n\nQueen Leonor moves to her husband's side, placing a gentle hand on his arm. She is a handsome woman with the sharp Aragonese features of her brother Alfonso, and she watches the scene with sympathetic understanding.\n\nDuarte collects himself and turns to Lucia, offering a bow that is perfectly correct but carries warmth.\n\n\"Your Majesty. Lucia of Este, now of Castile. My brother writes that you have been a mother to Isabel's children as well as your own. For that...\" His voice catches slightly. \"For that, you have my gratitude. Isabel would have wanted them loved, not merely tended.\"\n\nLucia curtseys gracefully. \"I could do no less, Your Majesty. They are wonderful children. Catalina speaks of her tia in heaven—we have made certain she knows.\"\n\nDuarte nods, blinking rapidly. Then he crouches down, lowering himself to Catalina's level—much as Demetrios had done weeks before.\n\n\"Catalina,\" he says softly. \"Do you know who I am?\"\n\nThe princess considers him with Isabel's eyes.\n\n\"You are the king of Portugal,\" she announces. \"Mama Lucia told me. You were my first mama's brother.\" She frowns. \"That means you are my tio.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Duarte manages. \"I am your uncle.\"\n\nCatalina thrusts the wooden horse toward him.\n\n\"This is Hidalgo. Papa gave him to me for Christmas. He is very fast.\"",

The tables are laden with roasted meats, fresh bread, cheese from La Mancha, dried fruits, and wine from Castile's finest vineyards. Nothing ostentatious—Duarte made clear this was not to be a state occasion—but warm, welcoming, abundant.\n\nThe Portuguese retinue is settled in the outer hall, where they fall upon the food with the gratitude of men who have spent weeks on winter roads. Duarte's household knights mingle cautiously with their Castilian counterparts, the universal language of soldiers bridging the gap between crowns.\n\nAt the high table, the family gathers. Duarte sits at Juan's right hand, Queen Leonor beside him. Lucia presides gracefully, directing servants with subtle gestures. Catalina has been permitted to sit at the table rather than eat in the nursery—a special occasion, she has been told—and she perches on cushions piled high on her chair, wooden horse propped beside her plate.\n\nFernando is with his wet nurse. Bianca sleeps in the arms of one of Lucia's ladies.\n\nDuarte eats slowly, his scholar's mind clearly elsewhere. He watches Catalina with an intensity that borders on painful—cataloguing every gesture, every expression, searching for his sister in this small stranger.\n\n\"The journey was not difficult,\" Queen Leonor offers into a brief silence. \"The roads through Extremadura have improved since... well, since your campaigns, I suppose. Fewer bandits when there are soldiers about.\"\n\nDuarte sets down his cup.\n\n\"Juan,\" he says quietly, \"I must thank you properly. For the painting. Henry wept when he saw it—and Henry does not weep. That you understood what it meant to us...\" He shakes his head. \"Treaties bind kingdoms. What you did binds families.\"",

Prior relationship: The painting gift, Henry's visit, established goodwill\n2. Juan's framing: He explicitly acknowledges Portugal's advantage/expertise\n3. Proportional sharing: Not demanding equal shares, but proportional to contribution\n4. No conditions on the earlier gift: The 10,000 florins came with no strings\n5. Family connection: Catalina sitting right there, Isabel's memory\n6. Juan waited to discuss in person - shows respect\n7. Henry already advocating for cooperation\n\n**What are the Failure Factors?**\n1. Castile is MUCH richer - potential to eventually dominate\n2. Portugal fought 200 years for independence from León-Castile\n3. Portuguese exploration is their thing - their unique advantage\n4. Sharing discoveries means sharing leverage\n5. Duarte is new to the throne - may feel need to prove independence\n\n6. Portuguese court/Cortes may resist foreign entanglement\n7. Ambiguity around \"proportional sharing\" could create future conflicts\n\nI see potential diplomatic landmines. The proposal's success hinges on precise definitions of cooperation and clear boundaries that protect Portuguese interests while allowing strategic collaboration. Duarte will carefully weigh the risks of entanglement against potential benefits of a measured alliance.\n\nJuan's diplomatic approach demonstrates nuanced understanding. By emphasizing fairness, waiting for personal discussion, and leveraging existing goodwill, he creates a framework for potential negotiation. The family context and prior positive interactions provide a supportive backdrop for delicate diplomatic maneuvering.\n\nThe power dynamics are complex - Castile's wealth against Portugal's maritime expertise requires delicate balance. Success probability seems moderate, with diplomatic skill and mutual respect being critical factors.\n\nD100 TABLE: KING DUARTE'S RESPONSE TO NAVAL COOPERATION PROPOSAL\n\nContext Assessment:\n\nSuccess Factors:\n\nPrior relationship strongly positive (painting gift rolled 97, Henry's visit)\n\nJuan explicitly acknowledges Portuguese expertise and primacy\n\n\"Proportional sharing\" framing respects Portugal's greater contribution\n\n10,000 florins gift came with no conditions—established good faith\n\nJuan waited for personal discussion rather than pressing through ambassadors\n\nHenry the Navigator already advocates for cooperation\n\nFamily connection (Catalina present, Isabel's memory)\n\nFailure Factors:\n\nPortugal fought 200 years for independence from León-Castile; sovereignty sensitivity runs deep\n\nPortuguese exploration is their unique advantage—sharing means diluting leverage\n\nCastile is far wealthier; risk of eventual domination even in \"partnership\"\n\nDuarte is new to throne (less than 2 years); may need to prove he protects Portuguese interests\n\nPortuguese Cortes and nobility may resist foreign entanglement\n\nProposal lacks specifics—\"proportional\" means different things to different men\n\nWhat Castile \"contributes\" versus what it \"gains\" remains undefined\n\nApproach Quality: Good. Respectful framing, acknowledges Portuguese superiority, builds on established goodwill. But vague on details, and the wealth imbalance creates inherent tension. Success likely at 30+.\n\nRoll\nResult\n1-10\nCautious Deflection. The weight of the crown presses on Duarte. Whatever his personal feelings, he is King of Portugal now—and Portuguese kings do not share their seas. He speaks warmly of friendship, of family, of gratitude for Juan's gifts... but when it comes to specifics, he retreats into vagueness. \"These are matters for councils and treaties, not family dinners.\" Henry's advocacy has not yet overcome the voices in Lisbon who whisper of Castilian ambition. The door is not closed, but no commitment is made.\n11-25\nInterested but Guarded. Duarte is clearly tempted. He speaks of Henry's enthusiasm, of the possibilities. But he raises concerns—gently, as befits family, but firmly. What does \"proportional\" mean precisely? Who decides what Castile contributes? What happens when Castilian ships outnumber Portuguese ones? He wants details before committing, and suggests continued correspondence and perhaps a formal embassy to negotiate terms. Goodwill remains, but Portugal will not be rushed.\n26-40\nWarm Reception, Conditional Agreement. Duarte acknowledges the wisdom of cooperation. He speaks of the Moors surrounded, of Christian ships on every sea. But he insists on safeguards: Portuguese primacy in the Atlantic must be recognized; any joint ventures require Portuguese captains; discoveries made with Portuguese knowledge remain Portuguese first. If Juan accepts these principles, Duarte is willing to formalize an agreement. A foundation, not a finished house.\n41-55\nGenuine Partnership Offered. The gifts, the respect, the family connection—they have done their work. Duarte speaks openly of his hopes and fears. Portugal cannot afford to explore alone forever; Castile cannot learn what Portugal knows in a generation. Together, they might achieve what neither can separately. He proposes specific terms: shared expeditions, divided costs, proportional claims to discoveries. Henry to coordinate with Castilian admirals. A true Iberian maritime alliance begins to take shape.\n56-70\nEnthusiastic Agreement. Duarte's scholarly caution gives way to genuine excitement. He has read Henry's letters, heard his brother's passion. Now, sitting across from Juan, seeing Isabel's daughter, he believes. \"Henry says you are different from other kings. He says you actually do what you promise.\" Duarte offers more than cooperation—he offers friendship between crowns. Shared charts, shared ports, shared dreams. Portugal's expertise wedded to Castilian resources. The details can be worked out; the commitment is real.\n71-85\nWholehearted Embrace. Something unlocks in Duarte. Perhaps it is Catalina's presence, perhaps Juan's evident sincerity, perhaps the memory of Isabel who loved this man. \"My father spent his reign building what Portugal has. I will not squander it on jealousy.\" He speaks of formalizing the alliance immediately—not vague promises, but treaties, shared expeditions planned for this very year. He offers Portuguese pilots for Castilian vessels, access to charts that have never left Lisbon. Henry will be overjoyed.\n86-95\nProfound Commitment. Duarte rises from his seat, moved beyond the reserve of kings. He speaks of destiny—of Iberian Christians united on every ocean, of Isabel watching from heaven. He pledges Portugal's full cooperation: shared exploration, mutual defense at sea, coordinated settlement of new lands. More than alliance—brotherhood between crowns, sealed not by parchment but by blood and memory. He asks only that Catalina know she has two kingdoms that love her.\n96-100\nTransformative Moment. What was meant to be a family dinner becomes something else entirely. Duarte, overcome by the confluence of grief and hope, proposes something unprecedented: a formal union of Portuguese and Castilian maritime interests under shared command, with Henry and Juan's future admiral as co-directors. \"Isabel would have wanted this. Our father would have wanted this. Let there be no more talk of Portuguese seas and Castilian seas—only Christian seas.\" A new era in Iberian cooperation dawns.\n\nReady to roll when you are, Your Majesty.",

Not as one king to another, but as... as Isabel's brother?\"\n\nHe does not wait for permission.\n\n\"When she died, I was in Lisbon.

Henry begged me not to squander it on caution, and I told him—I told him that kings must be careful.

The one thing you might have kept to remember her by—and you gave it back to us. Because you understood what it meant to us.\"\n\nHis voice breaks slightly.\n\n\"Henry wept. Henry. The man who has sailed into storms that would terrify Odysseus, who has buried more sailors than he can count, who has never once flinched from any danger—he wept like a child.

This man has a soul.'\"\n\nDuarte reaches out and grips Juan's shoulder—an intimacy that would be unthinkable between most monarchs.\n\n\"I came here to see my niece. To thank you for your gifts. To discuss cooperation.\" He almost spits the word. \"Cautious, careful cooperation. Terms and treaties and provisions.\"\n\nHe shakes his head.\n\n\"I cannot do it. I cannot sit here, looking at Isabel's daughter, and haggle like a merchant.\"\n\nHe releases Juan's shoulder and steps back, straightening to his full height. When he speaks again, his voice carries the weight of royal pronouncement.\n\n\"I propose something that has never existed. A union of Portuguese and Castilian maritime interests—not alliance, not cooperation, but union. One fleet serving two crowns. Henry and your admiral as co-directors, answerable to both thrones. Portuguese knowledge wedded to Castilian resources. No more talk of Portuguese seas and Castilian seas—only Christian seas.\"\n\nQueen Leonor's eyes widen. This is clearly not what they discussed on the road from Lisbon.\n\nDuarte does not notice. His gaze is fixed on Juan, burning with an intensity that transforms the mild scholar into something fiercer.\n\n\"Isabel would have wanted this. Our father, God rest him, would have wanted this. Let our children—\" he gestures toward Catalina, who has stopped playing and watches with wide eyes— \"let them inherit not two squabbling kingdoms fighting over scraps of ocean, but a brotherhood. Christendom united from the Atlantic to Constantinople.\"\n\nHe extends his hand.\n\n\"What say you, brother? Will you make history with me?\"\n\nThe great hall has gone utterly silent. Servants stand frozen. Portuguese and Castilian knights alike stare at their kings. Lucia's hand has found its way to her heart.\n\nCatalina's small voice breaks the stillness:\n\n\"Why is everyone so quiet?\"",

Two kings, two crowns, two nations that have warred and reconciled and warred again across centuries—bound now by clasped hands and a dead woman's memory.\n\nDuarte's eyes glisten. He does not hide it.\n\nQueen Leonor rises from her seat, her Aragonese composure finally cracking into something like wonder. She has just witnessed her husband commit Portugal's greatest treasure—its maritime future—to a foreign crown. And yet she does not protest. Perhaps she sees what everyone in this hall sees: that this is not politics. This is something rarer.\n\nLucia crosses herself, a tear sliding down her cheek.

It is that they will fear we will take advantage of them. You saw Duarte last night—he was moved, genuine, swept up in the moment. But he has advisors too. And when he returns to Lisbon with this agreement, they will whisper in his ear.\"\n\nHe turns back.\n\n\"'The Castilians have more gold,' they will say. 'More ships soon enough. More soldiers. What happens when they no longer need us? What happens when Castilian captains outnumber Portuguese ones? When Castilian merchants dominate the African trade?' These fears are not irrational. Portugal fought two centuries to escape our shadow.\"\n\nDiego looks up from his notes. \"The Constable speaks wisely. I have been calculating—if we commit even a fraction of our treasury to joint expeditions, we will outspend Portugal ten to one. Within five years, the 'union' becomes Castilian in all but name. Portugal provides expertise; we provide everything else.\"\n\nHe taps his papers.\n\n\"This may be desirable from our perspective, but it will breed resentment. If we wish this alliance to last beyond Duarte's reign—beyond your reign, Your Majesty—we must build in protections that make Portugal feel like a partner, not a vassal.\"\n\nÁlvaro nods. \"Proportional contributions, proportional gains. But also proportional control. If Henry and Vilaragut are co-directors, decisions must require both their approval. Portuguese captains must command Portuguese ships, even if we pay for them. The charts remain in Lisbon, copied but not surrendered.\"\n\nHe returns to his seat.\n\n\"Give Duarte something to take home to his nobles. Something that shows Portugal's interests are protected. Then this alliance might outlive us all.\"\n\nA knock at the door. A servant enters.\n\n\"Your Majesty—King Duarte and his advisors await your pleasure.\"",

This is a crucial scene - we need to figure out the practical details of the extraordinary agreement made last night.\n\nLet me think about who Duarte would bring:\n- Probably a senior advisor/chancellor type\n- Perhaps a maritime expert (though Henry isn't here - he's back in Portugal)\n- Maybe a financial advisor\n\nQueen Leonor might or might not be present - probably not for formal negotiations.\n\nI need to play Duarte as still enthusiastic from last night, but his advisors will be more cautious. They weren't swept up in the emotional moment. They're thinking about Portuguese interests.\n\nThe key tension: Duarte committed to something extraordinary, but now the details must be worked out. His advisors will try to protect Portuguese interests without undermining their king's word.\n\nLet me set the scene and introduce the Portuguese delegation, then have Duarte speak first to establish the tone.\n\nThe Council Chamber — Formal Negotiations\n\nThe doors open. King Duarte enters first, looking somewhat more composed than he did last night, though the warmth in his eyes remains when they meet Juan's. He has slept little, one suspects—but there is no regret in his bearing.\n\nBehind him come three men:\n\nDom Fernando de Castro, a silver-haired nobleman with the bearing of a soldier and the eyes of an accountant. Duarte's principal advisor, inherited from King João. His expression is carefully neutral, but there is tension in his shoulders. He was not present last night. He has heard reports.\n\nGonçalo Pacheco, younger, dark-bearded, carrying a leather satchel bulging with documents. A royal secretary, by the look of him—the sort of man who remembers details and worries about precedents.\n\nVasco Martins, weathered and sea-worn, with the calloused hands of a man who has hauled rope. A captain, perhaps, or a navigator. Henry's man, almost certainly—sent to represent Portuguese maritime interests.\n\nDuarte surveys the room—Álvaro, Diego, the modest furnishings—and smiles.\n\n\"Good. No thrones, no heralds, no ceremony. I told my men this morning: we are not here to negotiate as strangers. We are here to build something together.\"\n\nDom Fernando's expression flickers almost imperceptibly. He clearly expected negotiation.\n\nDuarte takes a seat across from Juan, his advisors arranging themselves behind him. He folds his hands on the table.\n\n\"I have not slept, brother. I have been thinking instead. About what I said last night, and what it means.\" He holds Juan's gaze steadily. \"I do not retract a word of it. But my advisors—\" a slight glance backward— \"have reminded me that grand visions require practical foundations.\"\n\nDom Fernando steps forward slightly.\n\n\"Your Majesty of Castile,\" he says, his voice respectful but measured. \"Portugal rejoices in the friendship between our crowns. But an undertaking of this magnitude requires... clarity. We must understand precisely what is proposed, what each kingdom contributes, and how decisions shall be made.\"\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\"We have questions.\"",

      "text": "Juan is making a significant proposal to Duarte. Let me think about how Duarte and his advisors would react.\n\nJuan is proposing:\n1. Castilian army at Portugal's disposal for Morocco campaign\n2. Castile focuses on the East (Ottoman fight), Portugal on Atlantic/Africa\n3. Sharing profits from Eastern conquests with Portugal\n4. Trade network from African coast to Black Sea\n5. Funding Henry's expeditions\n6. Helping establish trade posts\n7. Possibly deploying Castilian army in Africa to take lands (Mali?)\n8. Showing his fleet expansion plans\n\nThis is extraordinarily generous from Castile's perspective. Let me think about how the Portuguese would react:\n\n**Positive aspects for Portugal:**\n- Castilian gold funding their expeditions\n- Castilian army protecting/expanding their interests in Morocco\n- Access to Eastern markets for African goods\n- Their expertise valued and respected\n- No challenge to their Atlantic primacy\n\n**Concerns for Portugal:**\n- Mali is not really a \"target\" in the traditional sense - it's far inland, Muslim but also a major trading partner. The gold comes FROM Mali. Attacking Mali would be... complicated.\n- Morocco is not easy - the Portuguese have struggled there\n- This is almost TOO generous - what does Castile really want?\n- Dom Fernando will be suspicious - this sounds like Portugal becomes dependent on Castilian gold and military\n\n**Historical context:**\n- Portugal's interest is trade, not conquest in Africa (mostly)\n- They want trading posts, not territorial empire (at this point)\n- Mali controls the gold trade - they're more valuable as trading partners than enemies\n- Morocco is a real threat (pirates, raids on Portuguese shipping)\n\nThe fleet plans Juan shows would be impressive but also potentially alarming - Castile building a massive fleet could eventually challenge Portuguese naval dominance.\n\nLet me think about how to play this scene:\n\nDuarte was swept up in emotion last night. His advisors are more cautious. Dom Fernando in particular would be asking probing questions. Vasco Martins (Henry's man) would be interested in the practical naval aspects.\n \nThe Portuguese would likely respond diplomatically, emphasizing their strategic approach to African interactions. They see Mali as a crucial trading partner, not a conquest target. Their maritime strategy focuses on establishing trade routes around Africa, avoiding direct military confrontation. The proposal to \"take\" Mali would be met with diplomatic clarification, highlighting Portugal's preference for economic engagement over territorial expansion.\n\nVasco Martins shows keen interest in the fleet details, while Dom Fernando carefully probes Castile's underlying motivations. The negotiation will proceed constructively, with the Portuguese maintaining an open but cautious stance.\n\nThe Council Chamber\n\nDuarte studies the fleet projections with genuine interest, passing them to Vasco Martins, who pores over the numbers with the intensity of a man who speaks the language of ships.\n\n\"One hundred and eighty vessels by 1440,\" Vasco murmurs, half to himself. \"Mother of God.\"\n\nDom Fernando's neutral expression has shifted to something more complex—wariness mixed with reluctant admiration. He exchanges a glance with Gonçalo Pacheco, who is scribbling furiously.\n\nDuarte is quiet for a long moment. When he speaks, his voice is measured—the scholar-king reasserting himself after last night's passion.\n\n\"Brother, your generosity is... extraordinary. You offer your army, your gold, your fleet—all in service of a partnership where Portugal contributes expertise and little else.\" He raises a hand before Juan can respond. \"I do not say this to refuse. I say it because my advisors will ask, and your advisors should ask: what does Castile gain from such an arrangement?\"\n\nDom Fernando steps forward.\n\n\"If I may, Your Majesty.\" He addresses Juan directly now. \"Portugal has fought in Morocco for twenty years. Ceuta cost us dearly to take and costs us still to hold. The Moors do not yield their coast easily. Castilian armies are formidable—but Morocco is not Granada. The terrain, the distances, the supply lines...\"\n\nHe pauses diplomatically.\n\n\"We would welcome Castilian strength. But we must understand the scope of what is proposed. A raid? A campaign? Permanent conquest?\"\n\nVasco Martins looks up from the fleet plans.\n\n\"And regarding Mali, Your Majesty—\" His tone is respectful but careful. \"Mali is not... a target, precisely. The gold comes from Mali, yes, but through trade. The kingdom lies far inland, beyond the great desert. We cannot march armies there. Prince Henry's dream is to sail around—to find the sea route that bypasses the desert entirely and reaches the gold kingdoms by water.\"\n\nHe gestures vaguely southward.\n\n\"The trading posts we establish on the coast are waypoints toward that goal. We befriend local chiefs, trade European goods for gold and slaves and ivory. Conquest would... complicate this.\"\n\nDuarte nods slowly.\n\n\"What Vasco means, brother, is that Portugal's approach in Africa has been commerce, not crusade. We lack the men for empire. But with Castilian strength behind us...\" He trails off, thinking. \"Morocco is one thing. The pirates must be dealt with, the coast secured. But beyond that—the African interior, the gold kingdoms—we must be strategic, not ambitious.\"\n\nHe meets Juan's eyes.\n\n\"Tell me of your Morocco plans. And tell me what you would ask of Portugal in return for all you offer. I would know the shape of this partnership before we put quill to parchment.\"",

The question is whether his advisors can be brought along.\n\nI should have Duarte respond warmly but his advisors probe more - this is realistic. Dom Fernando especially should be asking hard questions. Vasco Martins (Henry's man) should be more enthusiastic since Henry already supports cooperation.\n\nLet me write the response showing this dynamic.\n\nThe Council Chamber\n\nA smile breaks across Duarte's face—genuine, almost boyish.\n\n\"A brother with a big stick.\" He laughs softly. \"Henry will love that. He has been saying for years that Portugal's reach exceeds its grasp. We find the routes, we build the posts, and then we lack the men to defend them when local chiefs grow bold or rivals circle.\"\n\nVasco Martins nods vigorously. \"It is true, Your Majesty. We lost a trading post on the Arguim coast last year—not to any great army, but to a dispute with a local chief we could not resolve by force. Thirty men cannot hold what thirty men can take. If we had known Castilian soldiers might answer a call...\"\n\nDom Fernando, however, has not relaxed.\n\n\"A Muslim vassal,\" he says, his tone carefully neutral. \"This is... pragmatic. But I wonder how Rome will view such an arrangement. You have the Pope's ear, Your Majesty of Castile. Will he bless a crusader king installing infidels to rule other infidels?\"\n\nHe steps forward.\n\n\"And the ports themselves—Tangier, Ceuta, Tétouan. If Castile takes them, who holds them? Castilian garrisons? Castilian governors?\" His eyes are sharp. \"Portugal has bled for twenty years to hold Ceuta.

But he asks what I too must understand.\" He leans forward. \"If Castile secures the Moroccan coast, how do we ensure Portugal is partner and not... dependent?

      "text": "Juan is proposing something quite significant here - essentially adding any African vassals to the maritime union they're creating. This would mean:\n\n1. Morocco (if conquered) would be added to the joint union\n2. This addresses Dom Fernando's concerns about Portuguese sovereignty - they wouldn't be dependent on Castile, they'd be partners in a shared enterprise\n3. It would reduce Portugal's costs of maintaining Ceuta\n4. Pirates would be driven away, benefiting both kingdoms\n\nThis is a clever proposal that addresses the Portuguese concerns directly. Let me think about how Duarte and his advisors would react:\n\n**Success Factors:**\n- Directly addresses Dom Fernando's concern about Portuguese sovereignty\n- Offers to share control rather than monopolize it\n- Reduces Portugal's burden (Ceuta costs)\n- Practical benefits are clear (pirates, trade access)\n- Builds on the spirit of last night's agreement\n- Shows Juan is thinking in terms of genuine partnership, not Castilian dominance\n\n**Failure Factors:**\n- This is an even MORE ambitious proposal than last night\n- Dom Fernando may see this as Castile trying to absorb Portuguese interests\n- \"Union\" controlling African vassals is unprecedented - what does governance look like?\n- Castile would be doing most of the conquering - does that give them more weight?\n- Portugal's Ceuta was won with Portuguese blood - sharing control might feel like dilution\n\nHowever, given the 99 roll from last night, Duarte is already deeply committed emotionally. This proposal actually HELPS him sell the arrangement back home because it addresses the key concern: Portugal won't be dependent, they'll be equal partners in shared holdings.\n\nI should show a range of reactions from his advisors - Dom Fernando still cautious but seeing the logic, Vasco Martins excited about the maritime implications, and Duarte himself recognizing this solves his political problem.\n\nI don't think this needs a roll - it's a natural extension of what was already agreed, and it actually makes the deal MORE palatable to Portuguese skeptics. Let me write the scene.\n\nThe Council Chamber\n\nDom Fernando opens his mouth—then closes it. His brow furrows.\n\nFor the first time since entering the chamber, the silver-haired advisor looks genuinely caught off guard. He glances at Gonçalo Pacheco, who has stopped scribbling and stares at Juan with something like astonishment.\n\nVasco Martins breaks the silence with a low whistle.\n\n\"Saints preserve us,\" he mutters. \"He means to put Morocco itself into the union.\"\n\nDuarte has gone very still. His scholar's mind is working visibly, turning the proposal over, examining it from every angle.\n\n\"You would... share Morocco,\" he says slowly. \"Not Castilian territory with Portuguese access. Not Portuguese territory with Castilian protection. But union territory. Governed jointly. Benefiting both crowns equally.\"\n\nHe sits back in his chair.\n\n\"Fernando. You asked how we ensure Portugal is partner and not dependent.\" A strange light enters his eyes. \"This is how. If African holdings belong to the union rather than to either crown, neither can be master of the other. We rise together or not at all.\"\n\nDom Fernando's expression has shifted from wariness to intense calculation.\n\n\"The governance would be... complex,\" he says carefully. \"Who appoints the vassal? Who commands the garrisons? Who adjudicates disputes?\" But his tone has changed. He is no longer looking for reasons to refuse. He is looking for ways to make it work.\n\nGonçalo Pacheco finally speaks, his voice quiet but precise.\n\n\"If I may, Your Majesties—what is proposed is not merely an alliance. It is a... a condominium. Joint sovereignty over shared territories. There are precedents. Andorra, governed jointly by the Bishop of Urgell and the Count of Foix. The arrangement has endured for two centuries.\"\n\nHe pauses, consulting his memory.\n\n\"The key is clear division of responsibilities. One party need not do everything. Perhaps Castile provides the armies that conquer and garrison. Perhaps Portugal provides the captains and pilots who manage the sea lanes. Revenues are shared according to contribution—or equally, if the crowns prefer simplicity.\"\n\nDuarte leans forward, energy building in his frame.\n\n\"And Ceuta?\"\n\nHe looks at Juan intently.\n\n\"Ceuta has been Portuguese for twenty years. My father took it. Portuguese blood holds it still. If Morocco enters the union, does Ceuta as well? Do we surrender what we have already won to gain a share of what Castile might win?\"\n\nDom Fernando's eyes narrow. This is the crux of it—the point where Portuguese pride meets practical partnership.",

This gives Juan military control, but he justifies it by saying Castilian armies will do most of the conquering\n7. Ceuta remains Portuguese - not part of this arrangement\n\nThis is actually quite clever - it addresses Portuguese concerns about sovereignty while still giving Juan strategic control through his Defensor title. The Portuguese get:\n- Equal share of income\n- Ceuta stays theirs\n- Their expertise valued\n- A seat at the table for future conquests\n\nBut Juan gets:\n- Military command through Defensor title\n- Strategic control over African coast\n- Portuguese naval expertise for his eastern ambitions\n\nI need to think about how the Portuguese delegation would react.

His eyes move from Juan to the Portuguese delegation, reading faces.\n\nDom Fernando's expression is unreadable. His jaw works slightly, as if chewing on the proposal.\n\nGonçalo Pacheco's quill has stopped entirely. He stares at his parchment as though the words he has written there have rearranged themselves into something unexpected.\n\nVasco Martins looks to Duarte, waiting.\n\nDuarte himself sits very still. His fingers are steepled before his face, pressing against his lips. The scholar-king is thinking—hard.\n\n\"Let me be certain I understand,\" he says finally, his voice measured. \"You propose a new entity. A kingdom in all but name. All overseas conquests—yours and ours—flow into it. Revenues divided equally, regardless of who shed blood to take the territory. Ceuta remains ours, outside this arrangement.\"\n\nHe lowers his hands.\n\n\"But this kingdom falls under the protection of the Defensor Romaniae. Which means its armies answer to you. You command where they march, where they sail, where they fight.\"\n\nDom Fernando stirs. \"Your Majesty—\"\n\nDuarte silences him with a slight gesture, his eyes never leaving Juan.\n\n\"You offer us half of everything you conquer. Half the revenue from Morocco, from whatever lies beyond. In exchange, you ask for military command of forces that will be—by your own admission—largely Castilian anyway.\"\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\"And the purpose of this arrangement is to aid the fight against the infidel. The Sultan. Constantinople. The crusade that Portugal cannot fight alone and has no particular desire to lead.\"\n\nSlowly, almost imperceptibly, a smile forms on his lips.\n\n\"You are asking Portugal to become your partner in empire. To share in wealth we could never win ourselves, in exchange for accepting your leadership in war.\"\n\nHe glances at Dom Fernando.\n\n\"Fernando. Your thoughts.\"\n\nThe silver-haired advisor takes a long breath.\n\n\"It is... not what I expected, Your Majesty.\" He chooses his words with care. \"The proposal is generous in revenue and respectful of Ceuta. The symmetry argument has merit—if Castilian blood takes these lands, Castilian command is reasonable.\"\n\nHe folds his arms.\n\n\"My concern is the precedent. The Defensor Romaniae is your title, King Juan—personal to you. What happens when you die? Does this kingdom pass to your heir? Does the arrangement survive? Or does it collapse into dispute the moment one crown or the other finds the terms inconvenient?\"\n\nHe looks between the two kings.\n\n\"If this is to outlive us all, we must define not only what it is, but what it becomes. Succession. Arbitration of disputes. What happens if one crown wishes to withdraw.\"\n\nDuarte nods slowly.\n\n\"Fernando asks the questions that must be asked.\" He turns back to Juan. \"But I find myself... inclined to accept the shape of this, brother. The details can be worked. The spirit is right.\"\n\nHe extends his hand across the table.\n\n\"Tell me: is this what you envision?

      "text": "Juan is asking for Portugal to provide an admiral for the combined fleet. This is a significant request - he's essentially offering Portugal the command position of this joint naval enterprise, which is both generous and politically smart. It gives Portugal something tangible and prestigious, balancing the fact that Castile is providing most of the money and military force.\n\nLet me think about how Duarte and his advisors would react:\n\n1. This is a position of real power and prestige\n2. It acknowledges Portuguese naval superiority\n3. It gives Portugal a concrete role in the partnership\n4. Dom Fernando should be pleased - this addresses his concerns about Portugal being a \"dependent\"\n5. Henry the Navigator would be the obvious candidate, but he's focused on exploration\n6. Portugal has experienced admirals from their African campaigns\n\nThis seems like something Duarte would accept readily - it's a generous offer that addresses Portuguese pride and gives them real authority in the partnership. The question is who they would nominate.\n\nI should have Duarte react positively but thoughtfully - perhaps discussing potential candidates or asking about the scope of the admiral's authority. This is a moment of real partnership building.\n\nThe Council Chamber\n\nVasco Martins inhales sharply. Dom Fernando's eyebrows rise toward his hairline.\n\nFor a moment, no one speaks.\n\nThen Duarte laughs—not mocking, but genuinely delighted.\n\n\"You give us half the revenues. You pledge your armies to defend what we discover. You place my nephew at the heart of succession. And now you offer Portugal command of the combined fleet.\"\n\nHe shakes his head slowly, wonderingly.\n\n\"Brother, my advisors came here prepared to fight for scraps. To negotiate access, to protect our interests, to ensure Portugal was not swallowed whole.\" He gestures at Dom Fernando. \"Look at him. He has nothing left to demand. You have given everything before he could ask.\"\n\nDom Fernando, to his credit, manages a wry smile.\n\n\"It is... an unusual negotiating position, Your Majesty of Castile. I confess I am not certain whether to be grateful or suspicious.\" He pauses. \"I choose grateful. Suspicion has cost Portugal too many friends.\"\n\nDuarte turns to Vasco Martins.\n\n\"Vasco. You know our captains better than any man alive. Who could command a fleet of this scale? Who has the experience, the temperament, the vision to lead a combined Iberian navy?\"\n\nThe weathered sailor strokes his chin thoughtfully.\n\n\"There are several possibilities, Your Majesty. Dom Afonso de Albuquerque commands respect among the captains—steady, experienced, fought at Ceuta.\" He hesitates. \"But for something of this magnitude... Prince Henry would say—\"\n\n\"Henry cannot,\" Duarte interjects gently. \"My brother's heart is set on exploration. He would wither commanding convoy escorts and patrol routes. He must remain free to chase his horizons.\"\n\nVasco nods. \"Then perhaps Dom Álvaro Gonçalves de Ataíde. He served your father for twenty years. Commanded the defense of Ceuta against three sieges. The men love him, and more importantly, they trust him. He is old—sixty winters—but his mind is sharp as any young captain's.\"\n\nHe glances at Juan.\n\n\"He speaks some Castilian, Your Majesty. Learned it trading in Seville in his youth. And he has no patience for politics—he cares only for ships and the men who sail them. Such a man might unite Portuguese and Castilian crews better than a courtier could.\"\n\nDuarte considers this.\n\n\"Ataíde.\" He nods slowly. \"Yes. I think... yes.\"\n\nHe looks to Juan.\n\n\"I will send for him. He can be in Toledo within a month, perhaps sooner if the roads hold. You may judge him yourself—if he does not suit, we will find another.\" A slight smile. \"But I think he will suit. He is not unlike you, brother. A man who does what he says he will do.\"\n\nHe extends his hand again.\n\n\"An admiral for your fleet. Teachers for your academy. Charts for your captains. Is there anything else Portugal can give to seal this brotherhood?\"",

Send the new Portuguese admiral (Ataíde) to Seville, not Toledo, to meet Vilaragut (Berenguer is likely a reference to Vilaragut whose first name might be Berenguer - I should check) who handles construction while Ataíde commands at sea.\n\n2. Request an accounting of the Portuguese fleet for emergency scenarios (Ottoman war).\n\n3. Another 10,000 florins gift to Henry for:\n   - Inland expedition to find salt sources\n   - Find sea route to Mali\n   - Re-colonize Arguin with proper support\n   - Punish the tribes who killed the previous Portuguese attempt\n\n4. Future punitive campaign against corsairs of Safi (but not immediate - need time to prepare and can't spare ships now).\n\nLet me think about what Duarte and his advisors would say to all this:\n\n1. Admiral to Seville - straightforward, makes sense. They'd agree.\n\n2. Fleet accounting - Dom Fernando might be slightly sensitive about this, as it's essentially asking for military intelligence. But given the alliance, it should be acceptable. They'd probably agree but note the sensitivity.\n\n3. Another 10,000 florins to Henry - This is incredibly generous. Henry would be overjoyed. But the specific requests (inland expedition, Mali sea route, Arguin re-colonization with punishment of hostile tribes) are significant commitments. Let me think:\n   - Salt sources inland - this aligns with Portuguese goals\n   - Sea route to Mali - this is Henry's dream\n   - Arguin re-colonization with \"proper support\" and punishment - this is where Castilian military muscle comes in. Portugal lost a trading post there. Now with Castilian backing, they can try again.\n\n4. Punitive campaign against Safi corsairs - this would require planning. Safi is a Moroccan port city. This aligns with Juan's broader Morocco strategy.\n\nI should also note that the player is being very generous - another 10,000 florins on top of the previous 10,000 gift. \n\nThe total of 20,000 florins represents an unprecedented level of financial support. This massive investment demonstrates a deep commitment to Portuguese exploration and strategic objectives. The Infante Henry will view this as a transformative moment, providing resources to pursue his most ambitious maritime and commercial ventures. The Portuguese court will likely see this as a powerful diplomatic gesture, solidifying the alliance and showing Castile's genuine interest in Portugal's expansion.\n\nRegarding the admiral's name, I'll verify the historical records. The reference to Vilaragut from Chapter 2.30 suggests some complexity in identifying the precise individual. I'll align with the player's terminology to maintain narrative consistency.\n\nThe Council Chamber\n\nGonçalo Pacheco's quill is flying now, struggling to keep pace. He has filled three pages already.\n\nDuarte turns to Vasco Martins. \"You heard the King. Seville, not Toledo. Send word to Ataíde—he is to present himself to...\" He glances at Juan. \"Berenguer, you said? The construction admiral?\"\n\n\"Vilaragut,\" Álvaro de Luna supplies quietly. \"Berenguer de Vilaragut. Aragonese. Experienced, methodical. He oversees the shipyards.\"\n\nVasco nods. \"I will dispatch a rider today, Your Majesty. Ataíde can be in Seville within three weeks if the weather holds.\"\n\nDom Fernando steps forward, his expression thoughtful.\n\n\"Regarding the fleet accounting, Your Majesty of Castile—Portugal currently maintains thirty-two seaworthy vessels of various sizes. Twelve are committed to African patrol and cannot be withdrawn without endangering our trading posts. Eight more support Ceuta's garrison.\" He pauses. \"That leaves perhaps twelve vessels that could answer an emergency summons. Not a great force, but experienced crews who know Mediterranean waters.\"\n\nHe glances at Duarte, who nods permission to continue.\n\n\"If the Sultan moves against Constantinople, Portugal would need... time. A month, perhaps six weeks, to recall ships from patrol and provision them for eastern waters. But they would come.\"\n\nDuarte leans forward at Juan's mention of Henry.\n\n\"Another ten thousand florins,\" he says quietly. \"Brother, you have already given—\"\n\nHe stops himself. There is no point in protesting generosity.\n\n\"Henry will weep again,\" he says instead, a fragile smile crossing his face. \"An inland expedition for salt, the sea route to Mali—these are his obsessions. He has sketched maps of coastlines he has never seen, convinced the gold kingdoms can be reached by water. With proper funding...\"\n\nVasco Martins interjects, his sailor's practicality cutting through.\n\n\"Arguin is the key, Your Majesty. We held it briefly—a wooden fort, thirty men. The local Sanhaja tribes tolerated us until they didn't. We lacked the strength to punish them, so we withdrew.\" His weathered face hardens. \"With Castilian soldiers backing a new attempt, the calculus changes. The tribes understand strength. Show them we can hurt them, and they will trade peacefully.\"\n\nHe looks at Juan with something approaching respect.\n\n\"The corsairs of Safi are another matter. They raid from a fortified port—not some beach encampment. A punitive expedition would require proper naval force. Twenty ships, perhaps more, with soldiers for landing.\" He strokes his chin. \"But if the Moroccan campaign proceeds as you envision, Your Majesty, Safi might fall as part of that larger effort rather than requiring a separate expedition.\"\n\nDuarte rises from his seat.\n\n\"Brother. You have given us an admiral's command, a seat at the table of empire, revenge for Arguin, funding for Henry's dreams, and a promise to cleanse the seas of corsairs.\" He spreads his hands. \"I came here hoping for friendship. You have offered us a future.\"\n\nHe turns to Dom Fernando.\n\n\"Fernando. Draw up the terms. The overseas kingdom under the Defensor's protection. Equal revenues. Portuguese admiral commanding the combined fleet. Joint academy. Ceuta remains ours, all else held in union.\" He pauses. \"And add a clause—a formal clause—recognizing Prince Fernando of Castile as heir to these arrangements, with Alfonso of Aragon as regent should the unthinkable occur.\"\n\nDom Fernando bows. \"It will be done, Your Majesty. I will work with...\" He looks to Álvaro and Diego. \"Your Constable and administrator, if they are willing.\"\n\nDuarte turns back to Juan.\n\n\"How long do we have? I would see this signed before I return to Lisbon—but I would also spend time with my niece, if you will permit it. Catalina should know her uncle.\"",

Dispute resolution\n3. Military command specifics\n4. Revenue distribution mechanics\n5. What happens if one party wants to withdraw\n6. Succession details beyond what's been discussed\n7. The role of the Defensor Romaniae title specifically\n\nLet me have him ask the hard practical questions that would need to be resolved for a workable treaty.\n\nThe Council Chamber\n\nDom Fernando pauses, his hand halfway to gathering his notes. He straightens slowly, a flicker of surprise crossing his features—he had not expected to be addressed directly by the King of Castile.\n\n\"Your Majesty honors me by asking.\"\n\nHe sets down his papers and folds his hands behind his back, composing his thoughts. When he speaks, it is with the measured precision of a man who has drafted a hundred treaties and seen half of them fail.\n\n\"Several questions, yes. Forgive me if they seem tedious—but ambiguity in documents breeds conflict in generations.\"\n\nHe raises one finger.\n\n\"First: this overseas kingdom. It must have a name, a seat of governance, a seal. Where shall its capital be? Ceuta is excluded from the arrangement, so not there. Tangier, once taken? Or some administrative fiction—a council that meets alternately in Lisbon and Seville?\"\n\nA second finger.\n\n\"Second: the governor you mentioned. A capable Castilian or Portuguese noble, you said. Who appoints him? Both crowns jointly? One crown in alternation? What is his term—life, or a fixed period? And who may remove him, and for what cause?\"\n\nA third finger.\n\n\"Third: revenues. You say equal division. But revenues from what, precisely? Tariffs on trade? Tribute from vassals? Plunder from conquest? The sale of slaves?\" He pauses delicately. \"And who collects these revenues before division? A joint treasury, or separate accounting reconciled annually?\"\n\nA fourth finger.\n\n\"Fourth: disputes. When—not if, Your Majesties, but when—Portugal and Castile disagree on some matter concerning this kingdom, who arbitrates? The Pope? A council of nobles drawn from both realms? Some other mechanism?\"\n\nA fifth finger.\n\n\"Fifth: the Defensor Romaniae.\" He chooses his words carefully. \"This is a title granted by the Byzantine Emperor, yes? It is personal to King Juan. You have said it passes to Alfonso as regent, then to Prince Fernando. But what if Byzantium falls? What if a future Emperor revokes the title? Does the overseas kingdom's structure collapse, or does it persist independent of Constantinople's recognition?\"\n\nHe lowers his hand.\n\n\"Sixth, and last: withdrawal. God forbid, but we must consider—what if some future King of Portugal, or some future King of Castile, wishes to dissolve this union? Is it permanent and irrevocable? Or may either party withdraw, and if so, under what terms? What becomes of the shared territories?\"\n\nHe offers a slight, apologetic bow.\n\n\"These are the bones upon which the flesh of brotherhood must hang, Your Majesties. Answer them clearly now, and our children will bless us. Leave them vague, and our grandchildren will curse us.\"\n\nDiego de Daza is nodding vigorously, his own quill poised.

He wants to establish the basic principles first and work out the details later when they actually have territory to govern.\n\nThis is a reasonable position, but Dom Fernando is a cautious advisor who has seen treaties fail. He'll need to respond appropriately - not hostile, but perhaps with some concern about leaving things vague. Duarte may step in to mediate between his advisor's caution and Juan's pragmatism.\n\nLet me have Dom Fernando respond diplomatically but with a touch of concern, then have Duarte step in to find a middle ground.\n\nThe Council Chamber\n\nDom Fernando's expression flickers—a brief tightening around the eyes. He is a man who has spent a lifetime ensuring every clause is airtight, every contingency addressed. Being told his questions are premature clearly does not sit comfortably.\n\nBut he is also a diplomat.\n\n\"Your Majesty speaks with the confidence of a man who has conquered Granada in two years,\" he says carefully. \"Perhaps such confidence is warranted.\"\n\nHe glances at Duarte, a silent question in his eyes.\n\nDuarte raises a hand gently.\n\n\"Fernando.

A declaration of intent rather than a comprehensive treaty.\" He picks up his papers again. \"The basic principles, as King Juan says: equal profit sharing, merged fleets, protection under the Defensor's aegis. Seville as provisional capital. Details of governance to be established once there is something to govern.\"\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\"And a clause committing both parties to negotiate those details in good faith when the time comes. So that neither crown can later claim the other is imposing terms unilaterally.\"\n\nGonçalo Pacheco looks up from his notes. \"A framework agreement, Dom Fernando. Not a constitution. The constitution comes later.\"\n\n\"Just so.\" Dom Fernando nods slowly, warming to the approach. \"A document that binds us to partnership without pretending to answer questions we cannot yet answer.\"\n\nHe looks between the two kings.\n\n\"This I can draft. Today, if Your Majesties wish. Something brief, clear, and honest about what it is and what it is not.\" A faint, dry smile crosses his weathered face. \"And considerably shorter than the document I had been imagining.\"\n\nÁlvaro de Luna speaks for the first time in several minutes.\n\n\"A wise approach. Let the thing grow before you decide its final shape.\" He glances at Juan. \"It is how Your Majesty has handled Constantinople, after all. Principles first, structures after.\"\n\nDiego de Daza nods, already calculating. \"I can work with Gonçalo on the financial provisions. Simple language—equal division of net revenues, collected jointly, disbursed annually. The mechanisms can be refined as we learn what works.\"\n\nDuarte looks to Juan.\n\n\"Brother? Does this satisfy? A declaration of partnership, signed before I return to Lisbon, with the understanding that the fuller treaty awaits the conquest it will govern?\"",

The campaign is now in winter 1434/35. Catalina was born January 28, 1432. So by February 1435, she would be almost exactly 3 years old.\n\nThe character database entry doesn't mention singing. Let me search the project knowledge for more information about Catalina's talents and personality.\n\nI found the key information about Catalina's traits in Chapter_2_16_Summary.md:\n\n**Special Talent: Voice (Roll: 34 → 5)**\n- Sings like an angel—clear, pure, extraordinary range\n- Gift manifests early; silences rooms by age five\n- Cathedral choirmasters will weep to hear her\n\nSo Catalina has an extraordinary singing voice. She's now almost 3 years old (born January 28, 1432, and it's February 1435).

Let me narrate this touching family moment.\n\nThe Great Hall — Later That Day\n\nThe formal business concluded, the mood in the hall shifts. Servants clear away the documents and inkpots. Wine is poured. The fire crackles warmly against the February chill.\n\nCatalina has been playing in a corner with Queen Leonor, who seems utterly charmed by her grand-niece. But at Juan's words, the little princess looks up.\n\n\"Sing?\" She considers this seriously, as if evaluating whether the request meets her standards. Then she nods with the gravity of a performer preparing for a great stage.\n\nShe toddles to the center of the room, still clutching her wooden horse. She hands it solemnly to Demetrios—who has materialized from somewhere, ever watchful—and announces: \"Hold Hidalgo. He likes singing too.\"\n\nThe Greek accepts the toy without expression, though something flickers in his eyes.\n\nCatalina smooths her dress with exaggerated care, the way she has seen ladies do before important moments. She takes a breath.\n\nAnd then she sings.\n\nIt is a simple song—a lullaby, something Lucia has taught her. Duérmete, niño pequeño. The words are imperfect; she stumbles over a phrase, invents a word where memory fails.\n\nBut the voice.\n\nIt is pure. Impossibly pure for a child not yet three. The notes hang in the air like crystal, each one placed with an instinctive precision that owes nothing to training and everything to something inexplicable. The melody fills the hall—not loudly, but completely, as if the stones themselves have stopped to listen.\n\nDuarte's wine cup halts halfway to his lips. Queen Leonor's hand rises to her heart. Dom Fernando, the skeptical diplomat, stares at the child with undisguised astonishment.\n\nVasco Martins crosses himself.\n\nWhen Catalina finishes, there is silence. Not awkward silence—awed silence.\n\nThen she curtseys, exactly as Lucia taught her, and announces: \"That is the end. You may clap now.\"\n\nThe hall erupts—not in polite applause, but in genuine, startled wonder. Duarte rises from his seat, approaching the child slowly, as if she might vanish like a dream.\n\n\"Meu Deus,\" he breathes. \"Isabel's daughter. With the voice of an angel.\"\n\nHe looks at Juan, eyes bright with unshed tears.\n\n\"She has her mother's eyes. And something else—something not from either of you. A gift.\" He shakes his head slowly. \"Guard her well, brother. Voices like that are given once in a generation.\"\n\nCatalina, utterly unimpressed by the fuss, tugs at Demetrios's sleeve.\n\n\"Hidalgo back now, please.\"",

The pregnancy proceeds with remarkable ease. Child due September 1435. The d'Este line breeds true.\n\nThis is wonderful news for Juan. Let me narrate this moment appropriately.\n\nROLL: 97 — Immediate Conception, Exceptional Health\n\nIt is Lucia herself who tells him, one quiet evening in late February.\n\nThe children are asleep—Fernando in the nursery, Catalina in her small bed clutching a wooden horse, Bianca in her cradle. The Alcázar is still. Duarte and his retinue departed three days ago, riding south with signed documents and full hearts.\n\nJuan sits by the fire, reviewing Diego's latest reports on the infrastructure program. Lucia enters softly, wrapped in a wool shawl against the chill. She settles beside him, close enough that her shoulder touches his.\n\nFor a moment, she says nothing. Then:\n\n\"I have been speaking with the physicians.\"\n\nJuan looks up from his papers. Something in her tone—\n\n\"I am with child again.\" She says it simply, without drama. But her eyes are bright. \"They believe I conceived before the new year. Perhaps Christmas week, perhaps just after.\"\n\nShe takes his hand and places it on her belly—still flat, too early to show, but there.\n\n\"The physicians say they have rarely seen a woman carry so well. No sickness. No weakness. I feel strong, Juan. Stronger than I did with Bianca, even.\" A soft laugh escapes her. \"The d'Este women are bred for this, my mother used to say. I thought it was vanity. Perhaps it was simply truth.\"\n\nShe leans into him.\n\n\"September, they think. Perhaps October. You will have another child before the year is out.\"\n\nThe fire crackles. Outside, a winter wind rattles the shutters.\n\nLucia looks up at him, and there is something fierce beneath her gentleness.\n\n\"I know you must go east. To meet the Sultan. To do what only you can do. But know this—\" She squeezes his hand. \"When you return, there will be four children waiting for you. Four, Juan. And I intend to give you more after that.\"\n\nShe smiles, and it is the smile of a woman who has found her purpose and embraced it utterly.\n\n\"The House of Trastámara will not lack for heirs. This I promise you.\"\n\nSummary:\n\nConception: Late December 1434 / Early January 1435\n\nConfirmation: Late February 1435\n\nDue Date: September 1435\n\nPregnancy Status: Exceptional health; no complications expected\n\nLucia's Condition: Strong, thriving, showing none of the typical discomforts\n\nThe dynasty grows. Four children by autumn—Fernando, Catalina, Bianca, and one yet unnamed. The future of Castile takes shape.",

He'll be going to Tenedos to meet Sultan Murad II in Spring 1435, which will keep him away for potentially a significant portion of the year. This is an intimate family moment.\n\nI should have Lucia respond appropriately - she's a strong woman who has accepted her role, but she will also feel the separation keenly. She's pregnant, caring for four children (well, three now and one on the way), and her husband is going to negotiate with the Ottoman Sultan - a dangerous mission.\n\nLet me write a warm, intimate scene that reflects their relationship and the weight of the upcoming separation.\n\nThe Private Solar — Late Evening\n\nLucia is quiet for a moment, her head resting against his shoulder. The fire has burned low, casting long shadows across the room.\n\n\"A year,\" she says softly. Not a complaint—simply acknowledgment. \"You will miss the birth.\"\n\nIt is not an accusation. She knew what she married. A king who conquered Granada, who sailed to Constantinople, who now rides to meet the Sultan of the Ottomans as an equal. Such men do not stay home.\n\n\"I will have Demetrios,\" she continues. \"And Álvaro. And the children will keep me busy enough that I will not have time to worry.\" A small, wry smile. \"Much.\"\n\nShe turns to look at him fully, her dark eyes serious.\n\n\"Catalina will miss you terribly. She has become so attached since Naples. Every morning she asks where Papá is, what Papá is doing.\" Lucia laughs softly. \"She has decided that you are the most important person in the world, and she is very rarely wrong about such things—in her own estimation, at least.\"\n\nShe reaches up, touching his face gently.\n\n\"Fernando will not remember this absence. Bianca will not know you were gone. But Catalina...\" She trails off. \"Write to her, if you can. Even if she cannot read the words herself, I will read them to her. She will treasure them.\"\n\nLucia is silent for a moment, then speaks again, her voice lower.\n\n\"I know why you must go. I know what you are building—not just for Castile, but for Christendom. For our children's children.\" She takes a breath. \"I am proud to be part of it. Proud to hold what you have built while you ride to build more.\"\n\nShe kisses him softly.\n\n\"Come back to me, Juan. Come back to us. That is all I ask.\"",

His eyes glitter in the firelight.\n\n\"It was... elegantly done, Your Majesty. The painting, the gift to Henry, waiting for Duarte to come to you rather than pressing through ambassadors.\" He tilts his head. \"You have learned that the best negotiations are the ones where the other party convinces themselves.

He left believing the union was his idea.\"\n\nHe rises and moves to the window, gazing out at the dark courtyard below.\n\n\"As for France...\"\n\nA long pause. Isaac is thinking—weighing information, calculating probabilities.\n\n\"France cannot attack you. Not now. They are bleeding themselves white against the English. Orléans, the Maid, the endless sieges—they have no armies to spare for Iberian adventures. Charles VII sits on a throne that wobbles with every English victory.\"\n\nHe turns back to Juan.\n\n\"But you are right to think of them. France has long memories and longer ambitions. They will note what you are building. They will remember.\"\n\nIsaac begins to pace slowly, his voice taking on the measured cadence of a man laying out pieces on a board.\n\n\"Consider what they see: Castile has conquered Granada—something France talked of helping with for centuries but never did. Castile has allied with Aragon, ending generations of Iberian rivalry. Castile has now merged its maritime future with Portugal. And Castile champions Alfonso's claim to Naples over René of Anjou—a French prince, Your Majesty. A prince of the blood.\"\n\nHe stops pacing.\n\n\"Naples. That is where French interests and yours will collide. Not today. Not this year. But when the English war ends—and it will end, eventually—France will look south. They will see an Iberian bloc stretching from Lisbon to Constantinople, and they will see Naples flying Aragonese banners instead of Angevin ones.\"\n\nIsaac's smile is thin, humorless.\n\n\"They will not forgive that. The question is not whether France will oppose you, but when—and whether you will be strong enough by then that opposition is merely irritating rather than dangerous.\"\n\nHe settles back into his chair.\n\n\"For now? Watch Navarre. It is the hinge between France and Iberia. If France wishes to meddle without committing armies, Navarre is where they will do it. And watch Burgundy—Duke Philip plays his own game, and a Burgundy aligned with you is a Burgundy that threatens France from the north while you threaten from the south.\"\n\nHe spreads his hands.\n\n\"You asked if they will attack. My answer: not while England bleeds them. But cultivate friends on their borders. Give them reasons to look elsewhere. And build your strength quickly, Your Majesty. The window of French weakness will not last forever.\"",

Blanca was the actual hereditary Queen. Their son Carlos would have been heir.\n\nIf both died in this alternate timeline... the throne might pass to:\n\n1. Blanca I herself (if she's still alive) - she was the hereditary Queen\n2. Other children of Blanca and Juan (historically there were daughters)\n3. Some other relative\n\nI'll investigate the potential successors, focusing on Blanca's lineage and any surviving family members who might have a claim to the throne. The complex royal succession requires careful tracing of familial connections and legal inheritance rights.\n\nThe timeline presents a critical inconsistency. Chronicles suggest Juan and Carlos were simultaneously dead and alive - attending the Te Deum ceremony in Granada in April 1433. This temporal paradox demands meticulous cross-referencing of historical documents to resolve the discrepancy.\n\nThe character database notes indicate Juan's rebellion and potential death, yet another source places him as an honored guest. I need to reconcile these conflicting historical accounts, examining each source's credibility and potential errors in recording royal movements and status.\n\nSuccession becomes the key question. With Juan and Carlos potentially deceased, the focus shifts to Queen Blanca I's potential direct rule or the possibility of her daughters inheriting the Navarrese throne. The precise line of succession requires careful verification to understand the true political landscape of this period. Her precarious royal status makes Navarre susceptible to external political manipulation, with France potentially seeking to leverage her vulnerable position through strategic marriage proposals or diplomatic pressure.\n\nThe Private Solar\n\nIsaac pauses. A flicker of something—surprise, perhaps—crosses his face. It is rare for the spymaster to be caught off-guard, but the question has touched on something he perhaps assumed Juan knew.\n\n\"Blanca,\" he says after a moment. \"Queen Blanca of Navarre. She was always the true heir—the Infante Juan held the crown only through marriage to her, not by his own blood.\"\n\nHe steeples his fingers.\n\n\"When the Infante died in rebellion, and young Carlos was taken by fever shortly after... the crown reverted to Blanca in her own right. She rules from Pamplona now. A widow, childless, forty years old.\"\n\nIsaac's eyes narrow thoughtfully.\n\n\"She is... vulnerable, Your Majesty. A queen without an heir, without a husband, caught between France to the north and your growing power to the south. The French will be whispering in her ear already—perhaps offering a marriage to some French prince, or promising protection against Castilian ambition.\"\n\nHe rises and moves to the fire, stirring the embers with an iron poker.\n\n\"Navarre is small, but its position is strategic. Whoever controls those mountain passes controls movement between France and Iberia. If Blanca remarries a Frenchman, France gains a foothold on your border. If she remains alone, she becomes a target—for you, for France, for Aragon.\"\n\nHe glances back at Juan.\n\n\"Have you considered, Your Majesty, what Navarre might be worth to you? And what you might offer a widowed queen who finds herself very much alone in a world of ambitious kings?\"",

      "text": "Historically, Blanca I of Navarre (1385-1441) was Queen of Navarre. She married John II of Aragon (the Infante Juan in our game) in 1420. They had three children:\n1. Charles, Prince of Viana (1421-1461)\n2. Blanca (1424-1464)\n3. Eleanor (1426-1479)\n\nBut in our alternate timeline, the Infantes died in rebellion (early 1431), and Carlos, Prince of Viana, died of fever around the same time. So the succession has changed dramatically.\n\nIf Blanca I dies without heirs in our timeline:\n- Her children are all dead (Carlos died)\n- Wait, did she have other children? In history she had daughters too - Blanca and Eleanor. The game timeline only mentioned Carlos dying... let me check.\n\nLooking at the CHARACTER_DATABASE.md, it says:\n- Infante Juan de Aragón died early 1431\n- Carlos, Prince of Viana died of fever in early 1431\n\nBut what about the daughters? The character database doesn't mention them. I should be careful here - the game may or may not have established whether the daughters exist.\n\nIn history:\n- Blanca of Navarre (daughter) was born 1424 - she would be about 11 in 1435\n- Eleanor of Navarre was born 1426 - she would be about 9 in 1435\n\nIf these daughters exist in our timeline, they would be the heirs to Navarre.\n\nIf they don't exist or have died, then succession gets complicated. Historical claims might include:\n- The House of Foix (through earlier marriages)\n- The Crown of Aragon (through various connections)\n- France might assert some claim\n\nIsaac should present this carefully, noting what he knows and doesn't know. He should mention:\n\nI'll investigate the potential heirs and political ramifications. The daughters Blanca and Eleanor could be key successors if they're alive. If not, we're looking at complex territorial claims from Foix, Aragon, and potentially France. The succession isn't straightforward - multiple powerful houses have potential legal or strategic interests in Navarre's future.\n\nThe Private Solar\n\nIsaac sets down the poker and returns to his chair, his expression sharpening. This is the kind of question he lives for—the cold calculus of succession and opportunity.\n\n\"Blanca's marriage to the Infante Juan produced three children,\" he says slowly, counting on his fingers. \"Carlos, who died of fever. But also two daughters—Blanca the Younger and Eleanor. Both still live, unless my information is outdated.\"\n\nHe pauses, calculating.\n\n\"Blanca the Younger would be... ten, perhaps eleven now. Eleanor a year or two younger. Children, both of them. Unmarried. And therein lies the opportunity.\"\n\nIsaac leans forward.\n\n\"If Queen Blanca dies tomorrow, the crown passes to her elder daughter—Blanca the Younger. A child queen, requiring a regent. Who becomes regent determines who truly rules Navarre. France will fight for that regency. Aragon will fight for it. And Castile...\"\n\nHe spreads his hands.\n\n\"But there is a cleaner path, Your Majesty. The daughters are unmarried. Young enough that betrothals are not yet fixed. If one of them were promised to Prince Fernando...\"\n\nHe lets the implication hang in the air.\n\n\"Your son is Isabel's child—he carries Portuguese royal blood. If he marries into Navarre's succession, you do not conquer Navarre. You inherit it. Peacefully. Legally. In a generation, your grandson sits in Pamplona, and no one can call it Castilian aggression.\"\n\nIsaac's eyes glitter.\n\n\"Of course, France will see this coming. They will be maneuvering even now to secure those girls for French matches. The question is whether you can move faster—and what you can offer Queen Blanca that France cannot.\"",

Betrothal of her eldest daughter (Blanca the Younger, ~10-11) to a Castilian noble of HER choice\n2. Membership in the Defensor arrangement - protection under Castile's military umbrella\n\n**Success Factors:**\n- Navarre needs protection - France is a real threat\n- Juan is now extremely powerful - completed Reconquista, allied with Aragon, Portugal, has papal favor\n- The Defensor arrangement preserves Navarre's independence as a kingdom\n- Letting her CHOOSE the noble is generous - gives her agency\n- Juan didn't execute the Infantes - they died in rebellion, which removes some bad blood\n- Practical protection against French encroachment\n\n**Failure Factors:**\n- Her husband died rebelling against Juan - there may be personal animosity or at least wariness\n- France will be offering counter-proposals\n- The Navarrese nobles may fear becoming a Castilian satellite\n- \"Defensor arrangement\" is new and unproven - what does it really mean?\n- She may want MORE than just a noble marriage for her daughter - why not a prince?\n\n- She might perceive this as subtle Castilian territorial ambition\n\nI see potential political complications. Her potential remarriage to a French nobleman could dramatically alter the diplomatic landscape. Small kingdoms like Navarre typically struggle to maintain true independence in protective arrangements. The long-term implications are uncertain - what guarantees exist for Navarre's continued autonomy after her death? Historically, such kingdoms often ended up absorbed by more powerful neighbors, with Navarre eventually falling under Spanish control.\n\nThe proposed arrangement offers limited benefits. While providing some protection and marriage choice, it feels strategically underwhelming. The offer seems deliberately vague - a \"noble of her choice\" suggests diplomatic hedging rather than genuine commitment. Her personal agency is acknowledged, yet the proposal lacks substantive royal investment.\n\nA nuanced probability assessment seems appropriate. Success potential appears moderate, perhaps around 35-40% likelihood of meaningful implementation.\n\nThe Private Solar\n\nIsaac is silent for a long moment, turning the proposal over in his mind like a jeweler examining a stone for flaws.\n\n\"It has merit,\" he says finally. \"But also complications.\"\n\nHe rises and begins to pace again—his thinking posture.\n\n\"Consider what you offer: protection under the Defensor's aegis, and a marriage for her daughter to a Castilian noble of her choosing. Generous in some ways. You preserve Navarrese independence. You give her agency in selecting the husband—a courtesy many kings would not extend.\"\n\nHe pauses by the window.\n\n\"But consider what she hears: 'Join my arrangement, and your daughter marries a noble.' Not a prince. Not even an infante. A noble.\" He turns back to Juan. \"Blanca the Younger is a princess of Navarre, heir presumptive to a crown. Her marriage is her mother's single greatest diplomatic asset. And you ask her to spend it on... a count? A duke? Even a great house like Mendoza or Enríquez?\"\n\nIsaac shakes his head slowly.\n\n\"It may work. But Queen Blanca will wonder why Fernando is too good for her daughter while her daughter is not too good for a mere lord. She will suspect—correctly—that you are keeping Fernando in reserve for a greater match while binding Navarre to you cheaply.\"\n\nHe settles back into his chair.\n\n\"There is also the matter of her husband. The Infante Juan died in rebellion against you. Their marriage was not happy, by all accounts—she was the true heir, he merely the consort who styled himself king. She may feel no loyalty to his memory. Or she may harbor resentment that Castile drove him to his death, however justified.\"\n\nIsaac spreads his hands.\n\n\"And then there is France. Charles VII is weak, but he is not stupid. The moment you approach Blanca, French ambassadors will arrive with counter-offers. A French prince for Blanca the Younger. Perhaps a new husband for Blanca herself—some cousin of the King, binding Navarre to France through her bed as well as her daughter's.\"\n\nHe meets Juan's eyes.\n\n\"Your offer is reasonable. It may even succeed. But it is not overwhelming. You ask her to trust a new and untested arrangement, accept a lesser match for her heir, and align against France—all while you keep your own son uncommitted.\"\n\nA pause.\n\n\"What else might you offer to sweeten the cup? Gold? Trade privileges? A guarantee regarding her younger daughter Eleanor? Something that makes Castile's friendship irresistible rather than merely sensible?\"",

This might provide some pretext, but it's weak—he was King of Navarre through marriage, not a Castilian subject when he rebelled.\n\n3. **Blanca's position:** She is the legitimate Queen in her own right. The crown passed through her bloodline, not through the Infante's.\n\n4. **Practical considerations:**\n   - Navarre is small but mountainous—difficult terrain\n   - France would almost certainly intervene if Castile invaded\n   - It would alarm Portugal and Aragon (Juan's new allies) to see Castile gobbling up neighbors\n   - It would undermine Juan's reputation as an honorable king who keeps his word\n   - The Pope might object—Juan has built his reputation on being a crusader and defender of Christendom, not a conqueror of Christian kingdoms\n\n5. **Legal claims:** I don't think Castile has a strong direct claim to Navarre at this point. The kingdom has been independent for centuries. Any claims would be tenuous at best.\n\nIsaac would be honest about this—he's a realist. He would point out:\n- The legal claims are weak or nonexistent\n- The practical difficulties are significant\n- The diplomatic fallout could be catastrophic\n- But he might also note that \"reasons for war\" can be manufactured if needed\n- He might suggest that patience and marriage politics are a better path than conquest\n \nI recognize this is a critical strategic moment where Isaac must carefully counsel Juan. The advisor understands Juan's aggressive instincts but sees the potential diplomatic disaster. Isaac would frame his pushback as a pragmatic warning, highlighting the potential consequences that could unravel Juan's carefully constructed political position. His approach isn't about moral restraint, but about preserving Juan's strategic advantages and preventing a potentially ruinous military adventure.\n\nThe Private Solar\n\nIsaac goes very still.\n\nFor a long moment, he simply looks at Juan. There is no judgment in his eyes—Isaac does not traffic in morality. But there is calculation. Careful, precise calculation.\n\n\"You could take it,\" he says slowly. \"You have the army. Navarre fields perhaps four thousand men in extremity. You could muster twenty thousand without straining. The mountain passes are difficult, but not impossible. Militarily, it would be over in a season.\"\n\nHe holds up a finger.\n\n\"But.\"\n\nIsaac rises and moves to the fire, staring into the embers.\n\n\"Claims. You asked about claims.\" He turns back. \"Castile's claims to Navarre are... ancient. Tenuous. There were disputes two centuries ago, borders that shifted, oaths of vassalage that were sworn and then renounced. A skilled lawyer could construct an argument. But no one would believe it. Everyone would know it for what it was—naked conquest.\"\n\nHe begins to pace.\n\n\"Reasons for war are easier to manufacture than claims. Perhaps Blanca shelters bandits who raid Castilian territory. Perhaps she insults your ambassador. Perhaps she secretly corresponds with your enemies.\" A thin smile. \"These things can be arranged, if you wish them arranged.\"\n\nThe smile fades.\n\n\"But consider what you spend, Your Majesty. Not gold. Not soldiers. Reputation.\"\n\nIsaac stops pacing and faces Juan directly.\n\n\"You have built something remarkable. Not just an army, not just alliances—a name. Juan the Crusader. Juan the Liberator of Granada. Juan who returns sacred relics to Rome, who defends Constantinople, who keeps his word even to defeated enemies. The Sultan agrees to meet you because you are interesting—because you are not like other Christian kings.\"\n\nHis voice hardens.\n\n\"Conquer Navarre without just cause, and what are you? Another hungry king grabbing land because he can. Portugal will wonder if their 'union' is simply the first step to absorption. Aragon will watch their border with new eyes. The Pope will question whether his Defensor Romaniae is truly God's instrument or merely ambitious. France will have cause to rally others against you—not because you threaten them, but because you threaten everyone.\"\n\nIsaac returns to his chair and sits heavily.\n\n\"You asked if you could take it. Yes. You could take it tomorrow. But I would counsel against it—not because it is wrong, Your Majesty, but because it is expensive. The cost is not measured in florins or lives. It is measured in trust. And trust, once spent, is very difficult to earn again.\"\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\"There is also the matter of France. If you invade Navarre, France will respond. Perhaps not with armies—they are too busy with England. But with gold, with diplomats, with whispers. They will fund rebellions in your new conquest. They will turn every Navarrese into a patriot. They will make Navarre your ulcer, bleeding you for a generation.\"\n\nA long silence.\n\n\"The slow path is slower, Your Majesty. Marriage. Diplomacy. Patience. But it is also permanent. Conquer Navarre and you hold it by the sword forever. Marry into it, bring it into your arrangements willingly, and in two generations no one remembers it was ever separate.\"\n\nIsaac spreads his hands.\n\n\"What would you have me do?\"",

Trusted physicians who can identify and treat poisoning\n5. Varying routines to make assassination harder\n6. Body doubles (though this might be difficult for a king who needs to be seen)\n7. Trusted inner circle who watch for infiltrators\n\nIsaac would know about Byzantine practices especially - the Eastern Roman emperors had elaborate security measures including:\n- The Varangian Guard (elite foreign bodyguards)\n- Food tasters\n- Complex court protocols that kept potential assassins at distance\n- Networks of spies and informants\n- Trusted eunuchs in sensitive positions\n\nIsaac might also mention Ottoman practices - the Sultan has his own elaborate security.\n\nThe user mentioned they're still recruiting a toxicologist (mentioned earlier in the conversation). This is still an outstanding need.\n\nIsaac should give practical advice while also noting the limitations - no system is perfect, and Juan takes risks that cannot be fully mitigated.\n\nThe Private Solar\n\nIsaac nods slowly, his expression thoughtful.\n\n\"A wise question. And one that reveals you have learned from Constantinople.\"\n\nHe settles deeper into his chair, his voice taking on the measured tone of a lecturer.\n\n\"The Byzantine emperors—the ones who survived, at least—understood that protection is not one man. It is layers. Demetrios is one layer. An excellent layer. But a single man sleeps, eats, attends to nature's calls. A single man can be distracted, drugged, or simply overwhelmed.\"\n\nIsaac counts on his fingers.\n\n\"The emperors employed several systems simultaneously. First: the Varangian Guard. Foreign warriors with no ties to court factions, no family in the city who could be threatened, no ambition beyond their oath. The Varangians were Norsemen, Englishmen, Rus—outsiders who owed everything to the Emperor and nothing to anyone else. They could not be bribed by Byzantine gold because Byzantine gold was already theirs.\"\n\nA second finger.\n\n\"Second: food tasters. Not one—several. Rotating, so no single taster could be bought. The Emperor's meals were prepared in a sealed kitchen, watched at every stage, tasted by multiple people before reaching his lips. Tedious. Humiliating, even. But effective.\"\n\nA third finger.\n\n\"Third: physicians. Not merely healers, but men trained to recognize the signs of poison—the subtle ones that kill slowly over weeks, not just the dramatic ones that kill in hours. Your Tomás de Cuenca is a start, but he remains in Toledo. You need someone who travels with you. Someone who examines every cup, every dish, every gift.\"\n\nA fourth finger.\n\n\"Fourth: intelligence. The best protection is knowing of the plot before the knife is drawn. The emperors maintained networks of informants in every court that mattered—and in their own court most of all. Servants, eunuchs, minor officials—anyone who might overhear a whisper. I am building this for you in foreign courts, but your own household must also be watched.\"\n\nIsaac lowers his hand.\n\n\"And fifth—the one most kings neglect—routine disruption. Sleep in different chambers. Eat at irregular hours. Vary your routes. Never be exactly where you are expected to be. Assassins plan carefully. Deny them the certainty their plans require.\"\n\nHe pauses, studying Juan's face.\n\n\"For your journey to Tenedos, I would suggest this: Demetrios remains with your family—his skills are wasted on shipboard, and the Queen needs him more than you do while at sea. But you need someone. A shadow who watches while you sleep, who tastes your wine, who stands between you and every stranger.\"\n\nIsaac's eyes glitter.\n\n\"I have... a candidate. Not as skilled as Demetrios, but younger, faster, and—importantly—unknown. No one has seen his face in any court. He could travel as a servant, a squire, a minor clerk. Invisible until needed.\"\n\nHe tilts his head.\n\n\"His name is Álvaro de Mendoza—no relation to the great house, despite the name. A converso's son from Seville. I found him in circumstances I will not trouble you with. He has certain talents with a blade, a gift for going unnoticed, and—most valuably—no past that anyone can use against him.\"\n\nA pause.\n\n\"Shall I bring him to you? Or would you prefer a different arrangement?\"",

But they are trained for battle—for enemies who announce themselves with war cries and charging horses. They are not trained for the shadow war.\"\n\nHe rises and moves to the fire, warming his hands.\n\n\"It can be done. Demetrios could train them before you depart—a few weeks of intensive instruction. Not enough to make them masters, but enough to change how they think. To watch hands, not faces. To note who stands too close, who reaches into a cloak, who positions themselves near doorways. To taste wine before it reaches your cup without being asked. To vary formations so an archer cannot predict where you will stand.\"\n\nIsaac turns back.\n\n\"The preserved food is wise. Salt meat, hardtack, sealed casks of wine—these are difficult to poison without obvious signs of tampering. And if you eat only what comes from your own ship, prepared by your own men, you eliminate the most common vector. The Sultan may find it... eccentric. But eccentricity is better than death.\"\n\nHe returns to his chair.\n\n\"What you lack is expertise. A physician who knows poisons—who can examine a gift for contact toxins, who can recognize the early signs of slow poisoning before it is too late. And ideally, a food taster who understands what they are tasting for. Not merely someone who eats first and waits to die, but someone trained to detect the bitterness of arsenic, the sweetness of certain plant extracts, the metallic tang of antimony.\"\n\nIsaac spreads his hands.\n\n\"These are rare skills, Your Majesty. The Byzantines cultivated them over centuries. We must find what we can in weeks.\"\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\"I have put out inquiries. Discreetly. A physician in Valencia who studied in Constantinople before the troubles. A Jewish apothecary in Segovia whose knowledge of compounds is... extensive. A former servant of the Doge who fled Venice under unclear circumstances and may have experience in these matters.\"\n\nA thin smile.\n\n\"None are certain. All carry risks. But if you wish, I will pursue them and see who can be brought into your service before spring.\"\n\nD100 TABLE: RECRUITMENT OF PROTECTIVE SPECIALISTS\n\nContext: Isaac is attempting to recruit individuals with specialized knowledge in poison detection, food safety, and counter-assassination techniques. Time is short—only weeks before the spring departure. The pool of candidates is limited, and each carries potential complications.\n\nRoll\nResult\n1-10\nFailure. The inquiries come to nothing. The Valencian physician has died. The Segovia apothecary refuses to serve a Christian king. The Venetian fled further east when he heard someone was asking questions. You depart for Tenedos with only Demetrios's hasty training of the guards and your own caution.\n11-20\nSingle Recruit, Unreliable. Only the Venetian can be found and persuaded. He is knowledgeable but nervous—a man running from something. He may be useful, but he may also bolt at the first sign of danger. His loyalty is to survival, not to you.\n21-35\nSingle Recruit, Competent. The Jewish apothecary, Mordecai ben Shlomo, agrees to serve—not from loyalty, but for substantial payment and a guarantee of protection for his family. He knows poisons intimately, can train your food tasters, and has no political entanglements. A professional, nothing more.\n36-50\nTwo Recruits, Mixed Quality. Mordecai agrees to train your household in poison detection but will not travel east himself. However, he recommends a former student—a young converso named Diego who lacks his master's depth but has steady nerves and genuine skill. Diego will travel with you. Additionally, the Venetian is located and proves more stable than feared—he can advise on Byzantine methods.\n51-65\nTwo Recruits, Good Quality. The Valencian physician, Berenguer Martí, still lives—the death report was exaggerated. He studied under Greek masters and knows both medicine and toxicology. He agrees to join your household permanently. Mordecai provides training and reference materials before your departure. You have expertise both traveling and at home.\n66-80\nStrong Team Assembled. Berenguer Martí joins as your traveling physician. Mordecai trains your household and provides a detailed manual of known poisons and their signs. The Venetian, one Marco Contarini, proves to have genuine experience in the Doge's security apparatus and offers insights into how the Byzantines and Venetians protect their leaders. Three layers of protection established.\n81-90\nExcellent Results. All three recruits prove exceptional. Berenguer Martí is not merely competent but brilliant—he has developed techniques for detecting poisons that even Constantinople has forgotten. Mordecai agrees to enter royal service permanently, bringing his family under your protection. Marco Contarini reveals he was once tasked with administering poisons for Venice, and thus knows exactly what to look for. Your protection rivals that of the Byzantine emperors.\n91-95\nExceptional Network. Beyond the three primary recruits, Isaac's inquiries turn up an unexpected prize: a former member of the Varangian Guard, a Norse veteran named Erik Sigurdsson, who served three emperors before Constantinople's decline drove him west. He is old but still deadly, and more importantly, he knows how imperial protection worked at its height. He agrees to train your guards personally.\n96-100\nExtraordinary Success. Isaac's network delivers beyond all expectation. Berenguer Martí, Mordecai ben Shlomo, Marco Contarini, and Erik Sigurdsson all enter your service. But there is more: through Marco's Venetian contacts, you acquire a library—a collection of documents detailing centuries of assassination attempts in Constantinople and Venice, and how they were prevented or detected. Your household gains not just protectors but institutional knowledge. The foundations of a permanent royal security apparatus are laid.\n\nReady to roll when you are, Your Majesty.",

He is a professional—not a zealot, not a patriot, but a man of skill who sells that skill for fair compensation. The question now is: what exactly does Juan gain from this arrangement?\n\nRoll\nResult\n1-10\nReluctant and Limited. Mordecai's fear outweighs his greed. He provides basic instruction—a list of common poisons, their symptoms, general precautions—but refuses to travel, refuses to train others extensively, and makes clear he will flee at the first sign of danger to his family. His knowledge helps, but his commitment is shallow. A foundation, nothing more.\n11-20\nCompetent but Conditions. Mordecai is skilled, but he drives a hard bargain. He demands 500 florins annually, a house in the judería under royal protection, and a written guarantee that his family will not be subject to Inquisitorial investigation. He will train food tasters and advise on poison detection, but he will not travel east. He provides a capable apprentice instead—young, nervous, but teachable.\n21-35\nSolid Professional. Mordecai proves exactly what Isaac promised: knowledgeable, discreet, and uninterested in politics. He trains three members of the royal household as food tasters, provides a detailed written guide to common poisons, and examines the ship's stores before departure. He remains in Segovia but makes himself available by courier for consultation. Reliable, if uninspiring.\n36-50\nHidden Depths. Mordecai initially presents himself as a simple apothecary, but as trust builds, he reveals more. He once served a Moorish emir in Granada—before the conquest—and knows poisons used in Islamic courts that Christian physicians have never encountered. His training is more comprehensive than expected. He still will not travel, but he provides a former apprentice, Samuel, who is steadier than anticipated.\n51-65\nNetwork Access. Mordecai himself is merely competent, but his connections prove valuable. Through the Jewish communities that span the Mediterranean, he can send inquiries to Constantinople, Venice, Cairo. Within weeks, he provides intelligence on Ottoman poisoning methods gathered from Jewish physicians who serve in the Sultan's court. Knowledge your enemies did not expect you to have.\n66-80\nUnexpected Loyalty. Something about Juan's treatment of him—the respect, the lack of condescension—moves Mordecai beyond mere professionalism. He begins to care about the king's survival. His training becomes more thorough, his warnings more urgent. He volunteers information he was not asked for. He is still not a warrior, but he has become genuinely invested.\n81-90\nFamily Treasure. Mordecai reveals that his grandfather served the Nasrid sultans of Granada for thirty years, and kept records—detailed accounts of every poisoning attempt, successful and failed, in the Alhambra. These documents have been hidden since the conquest. He offers them to Juan in exchange for permanent protection of his extended family. A treasure trove of shadow warfare knowledge.\n91-95\nThe Apprentice Exceeds the Master. Mordecai's training produces unexpected fruit. One of the food tasters he trains—a quiet young man named Tomás—proves to have extraordinary sensitivity to tastes and smells. He can detect compounds that Mordecai himself would miss. A natural talent, rare and invaluable. Mordecai recommends he travel with the King; Tomás agrees.\n96-100\nConversion of Purpose. Mordecai, a man who has spent his life surviving by staying invisible, experiences something unexpected: belief. In Juan's mission. In the Defensor's purpose. He requests baptism—not from fear, but from genuine conviction. He pledges his knowledge, his family's knowledge, and his remaining years to the crown. A converso by choice, not coercion. Isaac is stunned.\n\nReady to roll when you are, Your Majesty.",

A natural talent, rare and invaluable. Mordecai recommends he travel with the King; Tomás agrees.\n\nThis is an excellent result! From a mediocre initial roll of 24, the player has gotten a very good specific outcome. Let me narrate this discovery.\n\nROLL: 91 — The Apprentice Exceeds the Master\n\nSegovia — Two Weeks Later\n\nIsaac's message arrives with typical brevity: Come. There is something you should see.\n\nThe journey to Segovia is brief—a day's hard ride through winter-brown hills. Mordecai ben Shlomo receives Juan in a modest house in the judería, its rooms cluttered with dried herbs, glass vessels, and the sharp scent of compounds Juan cannot name.\n\nThe apothecary is a small man, perhaps fifty, with ink-stained fingers and eyes that have spent too many years squinting at fine measurements. He bows correctly but without servility.\n\n\"Your Majesty honors my humble house.\" His Castilian is precise, educated. \"Isaac de Baeza tells me you require instruction in the arts of poison detection. I have agreed to provide it—for appropriate compensation and certain... protections.\"\n\nThe negotiations are brief. Five hundred florins annually. A guarantee of safety for his family. No Inquisitorial investigations. Juan agrees without haggling; there is no time for it.\n\nBut it is not Mordecai who proves the revelation.\n\nThe Testing\n\nOver the following days, Mordecai trains a rotating group of royal servants in the basics of food tasting. Most are adequate—they learn to recognize the bitter almond scent of certain compounds, the metallic aftertaste of arsenic, the suspicious cloudiness that indicates tampering.\n\nOne is different.\n\nTomás de Córdoba is perhaps twenty, quiet to the point of invisibility. A servant's son, unremarkable in every visible way. He sits in the back during Mordecai's lectures, says little, and watches everything.\n\nOn the third day, Mordecai conducts a test. Ten cups of wine, nine pure, one containing a minute quantity of antimony—so small that Mordecai himself can barely detect it.\n\nThe other trainees fail. They taste, frown, guess. Most choose wrong.\n\nTomás lifts the poisoned cup without drinking, sniffs it once, and sets it aside.\n\n\"This one,\" he says simply. \"It smells of tin. Faintly. And something else beneath—something sweet that should not be there.\"\n\nMordecai stares at him.\n\n\"How did you—\" The apothecary stops. He prepares another test, more difficult. Four compounds this time, mixed in varying concentrations. Tomás identifies three immediately and hesitates only briefly on the fourth.\n\nThat evening, Mordecai sends for Isaac.\n\nThe Assessment\n\n\"I have worked with many students,\" Mordecai tells Juan privately, his voice unusually animated. \"Trained dozens. Some were skilled. A few were gifted. This boy...\"\n\nHe shakes his head slowly.\n\n\"Your Majesty, I do not know how to explain it. His tongue, his nose—they perceive things that should be imperceptible. Compounds I can only detect with careful preparation and reference samples, he identifies by instinct. It is as if God gave him senses meant for a different creature entirely.\"\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\"I can teach him the names of what he perceives. I can give him the knowledge to understand what his senses tell him. But the gift itself? That cannot be taught. It simply is.\"\n\nMordecai meets Juan's eyes.\n\n\"He should travel with you, Your Majesty. I am an old man with a family; I will not survive the journey east, and I would slow you down. But Tomás? He is young, steady, and utterly without ambition. He wishes only to be useful.\"\n\nA slight smile crosses the apothecary's weathered face.\n\n\"I have given you what training I can. But in Tomás de Córdoba, I believe I have given you something better. A living instrument. Guard him well—such gifts are rarer than rubies.\"\n\nTomás de Córdoba\n\nThe young man is summoned. He stands before Juan with the quiet composure of someone who has spent his life being overlooked and has made peace with it.\n\n\"Your Majesty.\" A simple bow. No flourishes.\n\n\"Mordecai says you have a gift.\"\n\nA pause. Tomás considers the words carefully.\n\n\"I taste things others do not, Your Majesty. I smell things others miss. I do not know why. It has always been so.\" He hesitates. \"My mother said it was a curse. I could not eat half of what other children ate—too bitter, too sour, too wrong. But Master Mordecai says it can be useful.\"\n\nHe meets Juan's eyes directly—an unusual boldness for a servant.\n\n\"I am told you go to meet the Sultan of the Turks. That there may be those who wish you dead.\" A simple statement of fact. \"If you take me with you, I will taste everything before it reaches your lips. If there is poison, I will know.\"\n\nA pause.\n\n\"I am not a soldier, Your Majesty. I cannot protect you from swords or arrows. But I can protect you from what hides in cups and dishes. If that is useful to you, I am yours to command.\"\n\nSummary:\n\nMordecai ben Shlomo enters royal service as consultant and trainer\n\nHe provides comprehensive poison detection training to household staff\n\nHe creates written guides to common poisons and their signs\n\nHe remains in Segovia but is available for consultation\n\nTomás de Córdoba discovered as extraordinary natural talent\n\nPossesses superhuman sensitivity to taste and smell\n\nCan detect compounds that trained experts would miss\n\nWill travel with Juan to Tenedos as personal food taster\n\nQuiet, steady, without ambition—utterly reliable\n\nThe shadows recede slightly.

The knowledge of poisons is dangerous knowledge. Not merely to those who might be poisoned, but to those who possess it. In Granada, the Moorish physicians who served the emirs were both treasured and feared. Some were executed when their masters died—on suspicion alone. Others were kept close, watched always, lest they sell their secrets to rivals.\"\n\nHe moves to a shelf, running his fingers along dusty jars.\n\n\"If I build what you describe—a workshop, apprentices, a repository of this knowledge—I create something valuable. Something others will want. The French. The Venetians. The Ottomans.\" He turns back. \"And something your own nobles may fear. A Jewish apothecary who knows every poison in Christendom, who trains others in these arts, who has the King's protection...\"\n\nHe spreads his hands.\n\n\"There will be whispers. Accusations. The Inquisition may take interest, despite your guarantees. My people have learned to be cautious about visibility, Your Majesty. The tallest tree catches the most wind.\"\n\nA pause. Mordecai's eyes search Juan's face.\n\n\"And yet...\"\n\nHe moves to a locked cabinet, produces a key from around his neck, and opens it. Inside are rows of small vials, carefully labeled in Hebrew script. Books, old and crumbling. Scrolls.\n\n\"This is my grandfather's work. And his father's before him. Four generations of knowledge, hidden away because it was too dangerous to share.\" His voice grows quieter. \"I have no son. Tomás has the gift, but not the learning—not yet. When I die, this dies with me.\"\n\nHe closes the cabinet and faces Juan directly.\n\n\"If you offer me protection—true protection, not merely words—I will build what you ask. A workshop in Toledo, near the court, where I can serve your household directly. Two apprentices to start, chosen carefully. A library of compounds, their effects, their antidotes. Training for your physicians, your food tasters, your guards.\"\n\nHis eyes narrow slightly.\n\n\"But I will need more than florins, Your Majesty. I will need your word. That when the whispers come—and they will come—you will not sacrifice me to silence them. That my family will be untouchable.

Not in Toledo—too many eyes, too many whispers. Segovia is better. Mordecai is already here, already known as a simple apothecary. We do not move him; we simply... expand his operations quietly. A larger house, perhaps. A private courtyard where deliveries can arrive unseen.\"\n\nHe glances at Mordecai.\n\n\"The tasters train here, in small groups, never more than two or three at a time. They arrive as customers seeking remedies for minor ailments. They leave the same way. No livery, no royal insignia, nothing to connect them to the crown.\"\n\nIsaac turns back to Juan.\n\n\"The antidotes travel separately. A locked chest, as you say, delivered by trusted couriers who do not know what they carry. The court physicians receive it with instructions but no explanations. If anyone asks, the compounds come from... Venice. Or Constantinople. Purchased at great expense through merchants who value discretion.\"\n\nA thin smile.\n\n\"The tasters themselves become the visible face of this knowledge.

Mordecai's name never surfaces.\"\n\nHe stops pacing.\n\n\"The apprentices are the vulnerability. They must be chosen with extreme care—orphans, perhaps, or conversos with no family connections who might talk. They live here, with Mordecai, and they do not leave until their training is complete. Years, not months.\"\n\nIsaac looks at Mordecai directly.\n\n\"You would become a ghost, in a sense. Known to a handful of people, all of whom answer to the crown. Your work continues, your knowledge grows, but you disappear from the world's notice.\"\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\"It is not a small thing I describe. It is a life lived in shadow.

Your enemies cannot target what they cannot find.\"\n\nIsaac turns to Juan.\n\n\"We will need perhaps three thousand florins to establish this properly. The house, the equipment, the supply chains, the couriers. And ongoing costs—five hundred annually, perhaps more as the operation grows.\"\n\nHe folds his hands.\n\n\"But yes, Your Majesty.

Juan has addressed Mordecai's concerns directly, offered concrete protections, and shown he values both the man and his knowledge. The offer is generous and practical. However, Mordecai is a cautious man by nature and experience.\n\nGiven that Mordecai has already shown willingness to serve (he agreed to the initial arrangement), and Juan is now offering even MORE protection and resources, the baseline should be fairly favorable. Success likely at 25+.\n\nD100 TABLE: MORDECAI'S RESPONSE TO THE SHADOW ARRANGEMENT\n\nContext: Mordecai has already agreed to serve in principle. The question now is whether he accepts this deeper commitment—a life hidden from public view, training apprentices, building a secret repository of poison knowledge under royal protection. Juan has addressed his fears directly and offered concrete assurances.\n\nSuccess Factors:\n\nJuan has listened and adapted the offer to Mordecai's stated concerns\n\nThe arrangement directly addresses his fear of Inquisitorial attention\n\nHis legacy concern (knowledge dying with him) is solved by apprentices\n\nIsaac has laid out a practical, believable plan\n\nFinancial terms are generous\n\nJuan speaks to him with respect, not condescension\n\nMordecai has already seen Tomás's gift validated—proof Juan values this work\n\nFailure Factors:\n\nA lifetime of caution is not easily overcome\n\nRoyal promises to Jews have been broken before in Iberia\n\n\"The crown will shield you\" requires trusting a king he has just met\n\nHis family's fate rests entirely on this decision\n\nThe Inquisition is not a hypothetical threat—it is real and growing\n\nBecoming more valuable also means becoming more dangerous to possess\n\nRoll\nResult\n1-10\nFear Prevails. Mordecai's hands tremble slightly. He has heard such promises before—or his father did, or his grandfather. Kings change. Policies change. The protection offered today becomes the persecution of tomorrow. He agrees to the limited arrangement already discussed—training, consultation, Tomás—but refuses the deeper commitment. He will not build a workshop, will not take apprentices, will not make himself indispensable. He will remain small, invisible, survivable. Isaac's plan dies stillborn.\n11-20\nConditional Acceptance. Mordecai agrees, but with conditions that reveal his distrust. He demands written guarantees—signed by Juan, witnessed by notaries, sealed with the royal seal. He wants an escape route: funds held in a Genoese bank, passage arranged to Constantinople or Alexandria if circumstances change. He will serve, but with one foot always near the door. The arrangement functions, but Mordecai's heart is never fully committed.\n21-35\nReluctant Agreement. Mordecai sighs heavily—the sigh of a man who sees no better option. \"I accept, Your Majesty. Not because I trust kings, but because I trust Isaac's cunning and my own caution.\" He will build the workshop, take the apprentices, create the repository. But there is no warmth in it. He serves from calculation, not conviction. The arrangement is professional, effective, and utterly without loyalty.\n36-50\nPractical Acceptance. Mordecai nods slowly, weighing the offer against alternatives. \"You offer more than I expected. More than I dared hope.\" He accepts the arrangement as described—the hidden workshop, the apprentices, the shadow life. He is not joyful, but he is genuinely satisfied. A fair bargain, fairly struck. He will serve competently and keep his word. Trust may come in time, or it may not.\n51-65\nCautious Hope. Something in Juan's manner—the directness, the lack of condescension—reaches past Mordecai's defenses. \"I have spent fifty years expecting the worst from Christian kings,\" he says quietly. \"Perhaps I have been wrong. Or perhaps you are different.\" He accepts fully, and for the first time, there is a flicker of something beyond calculation in his eyes. He wants to believe. The workshop will be built with care, the apprentices chosen with diligence.\n66-80\nGenuine Commitment. Mordecai straightens, and years seem to fall from his shoulders. \"My grandfather served emirs. My father hid from inquisitors. I have spent my life waiting to be discovered and destroyed.\" He meets Juan's eyes. \"You offer me something none of them did: purpose. A reason for this knowledge beyond mere survival.\" He accepts wholeheartedly. The workshop becomes not merely a job, but a calling. His expertise flows freely; his counsel becomes invaluable.\n81-90\nA Burden Lifted. Mordecai's composure cracks. His eyes glisten. \"Your Majesty does not understand what you offer. Not merely safety—meaning. For four generations, my family has carried this knowledge like a curse. Too dangerous to share, too precious to destroy.\" His voice thickens. \"You offer to make it a gift instead. To use it for protection rather than destruction.\" He bows—not the formal bow of a subject, but something deeper. He is Juan's man now, truly. The workshop will become the finest of its kind in Christendom.\n91-95\nTransformation. What begins as negotiation becomes something else. Mordecai looks at Juan for a long moment, then at Isaac, then at the locked cabinet holding four generations of secrets. \"I have prayed for this,\" he says softly. \"I did not know I was praying, but I was. A king who sees value rather than threat. Purpose rather than danger.\" He unlocks the cabinet and removes the oldest scroll—crumbling, precious. \"This is my grandfather's masterwork. The antidotes he developed for the emirs of Granada. I have never shown it to anyone.\" He offers it to Juan. \"It is yours now. All of it. I am yours.\"\n96-100\nA Life Redeemed. Mordecai is silent for a very long time. When he speaks, his voice is strange—wondering, almost bewildered. \"Do you know what you have done, Your Majesty? You have made me matter. Not as a tool to be used and discarded. Not as a secret to be hidden and feared. But as a man with knowledge worth preserving, serving a purpose worth serving.\" He falls to his knees—not in subservience, but in something like gratitude. \"I will build you more than a workshop. I will build you a school. Not just for poisons, but for all the hidden arts—the medicines, the compounds, the secrets of the East that Christendom has forgotten. Let my apprentices teach apprentices. Let this knowledge grow and spread under your protection. Let my family's curse become Castile's blessing.\" He looks up, tears on his weathered cheeks. \"This is what I was born for. I know it now.\"\n\nReady to roll when you are, Your Majesty.",

His gaze moves from Juan to Isaac to the locked cabinet, and something shifts in his weathered face—a tension releasing, a weight redistributing.\n\nWhen he speaks, his voice is different. Steadier. Younger, somehow.\n\n\"My grandfather served the Nasrid emirs of Granada for thirty years.\" He moves to the cabinet, resting his hand on its worn surface. \"He was valued. Protected. When he died, the emir himself attended the burial—a Jew, mourned by a Muslim king. My father told me that story a hundred times. 'This is what we can be,' he would say. 'When the powerful see our worth instead of our strangeness.'\"\n\nHe turns back to Juan.\n\n\"My father never found such a master. He hid. He scraped. He taught me to be invisible, because visibility meant death. I have spent fifty years following his advice. Keeping small. Keeping quiet. Waiting for the knock on the door that would end everything.\"\n\nMordecai straightens, and it is as Isaac described—years falling from his shoulders.\n\n\"You offer me something none of them did, Your Majesty. Not merely safety. Purpose. A reason for this knowledge beyond mere survival. A chance to build something that outlasts me.\"\n\nHe walks to the cabinet and unlocks it. From within, he removes a leather-bound book, its pages brittle with age.\n\n\"This is my grandfather's formulary. Every compound he mastered, every antidote he developed, every technique he learned from physicians in Cairo, Damascus, Constantinople. I have guarded it like holy scripture. Showed it to no one.\"\n\nHe holds it out—not offering it, not yet, but displaying it.\n\n\"If I do what you ask—if I build this workshop, train these apprentices, create this repository—this book becomes the foundation. Its secrets pass to new hands. Hands you choose. Hands that will serve Castile long after I am dust.\"\n\nMordecai meets Juan's eyes directly.\n\n\"I accept, Your Majesty. Not from calculation. Not from fear. Because you have seen what my family carries and called it valuable rather than dangerous. Because you speak to me as a man with something to offer, not a problem to be managed.\"\n\nHe bows—a deep bow, the bow of genuine respect.\n\n\"Tell me where you want the workshop built. Tell me what apprentices you can find. I will make them into instruments of protection such as Castile has never possessed. This I swear on my grandfather's memory.\"\n\nHe rises, and there is a light in his eyes that was not there before.\n\n\"Your enemies will find that poisoning you has become... considerably more difficult.\"",

If not found, acknowledge this and perhaps ask for clarification or introduce the concept appropriately\n\nLet me search the project knowledge for more information about crown soldiers, professional soldiers, or standing army.\n\nActually, looking at the context again - Juan is asking about training his forces in counter-assassination techniques. He mentioned \"the royal guard\" and \"elite soldiers\" earlier. \n\nI recognize this as an emerging military concept for Juan's kingdom. Medieval rulers often experimented with professional standing forces to complement traditional military structures. The distinction between royal guard and crown soldiers suggests a strategic approach to military organization, potentially allowing for specialized training and deployment beyond typical feudal levies.\n\nI'll investigate potential historical precedents that might validate this organizational model.\n\nThe search results don't show a specific \"professional crown soldiers\" unit separate from the royal guard. Let me think about what exists in the campaign:\n\n1. The Royal Guard - under Captain Fernán Alonso de Robles - personal protection for Juan\n2. Crusaders - the 800 crusaders who fought in Granada\n3. Military Order knights - from Santiago, Calatrava, Alcántara\n4. Feudal levies - noble contributions\n\nThe user is asking about \"professional crown soldiers... directly paid by the crown\" as distinct from the royal guard. This could be:\n- A standing army unit that I should check for in the records\n- Or something the user wants to establish/develop\n\nLooking at the Kingdom of Castile 1433 document, I don't see a specific professional standing force beyond the guard.\n\nGiven that I can't find this specific unit, I should ask the user for clarification or present what exists and let them direct me. The GM instruction says to never generate dialogue or action for Juan, and to stop when needed.\n\nLet me present the situation as the GM and ask for clarification about which unit they're referring to.\n\nToledo — The Alcázar\n\nGM Note: I've searched the project files and don't find a specific reference to a separate corps of \"professional crown soldiers\" distinct from the Royal Guard under Captain Fernán. The military forces established in the campaign include:\n\n1. The Royal Guard — Captain Fernán Alonso de Robles, personal protection\n2. The Crusaders — approximately 800 men who fought in Granada\n3. Military Order knights — serving under their respective Masters\n4. Feudal levies — noble contributions when called\n\nCould you clarify which unit you're referring to? Or are you looking to establish such a force now — a small standing professional army paid directly by the crown, separate from the guard? This would be historically innovative for 1430s Castile, but not impossible given your resources and vision.\n\nAlternatively, if you mean Captain Fernán's Royal Guard, I can summon him for you.",

The budget includes 150 Crown Soldiers at 6,000 florins annually (40 florins per man). These are distinct from Captain Fernán's Royal Guard, which serves as personal protection.

A professional soldier in the 15th century might earn anywhere from 2-4 florins per month depending on skill and region. Let's say 2.5 florins/month = 30 florins/year in wages.\n- Food/provisions: Perhaps 5-6 florins/year if supplied by the crown\n- Equipment maintenance: 2-3 florins/year (armor repair, weapon upkeep)\n- Housing/barracks: Minimal if using existing fortifications\n- Miscellaneous: 1-2 florins/year\n\nThat roughly adds up to 40 florins per man.\n\n**Scaling considerations:**\n- Economies of scale: Bulk purchasing of food, equipment might reduce per-unit costs slightly\n- Diseconomies of scale: Need more officers, more logistics, more administration\n- Infrastructure: 150 men can garrison existing castles. 2,000 or 10,000 would need barracks, training grounds, supply chains\n- Officers: Need a command structure - sergeants, lieutenants, captains\n- Equipment: Initial outfitting costs for new recruits (armor, weapons, horses if cavalry)\n\n**2,000 men:**\n- At 40 florins/man = 80,000 florins/year (just maintenance)\n- Plus initial equipment costs: maybe 20-30 florins per man for basic kit = 37,000-60,000 one-time\n- Plus officers, infrastructure\n\n**10,000 men:**\n\nA staggering financial and logistical challenge. Maintaining such a force would consume 400,000 florins annually, representing an unprecedented military investment. This scale would fundamentally transform the kingdom's military capabilities and economic structure. Recruiting, equipping, and sustaining such a large force would strain royal resources, requiring extensive administrative infrastructure and complex supply networks. The recruitment itself would be a monumental task, potentially disrupting local economies and social structures to fill the ranks.\n\nThe Solar — Toledo\n\nCaptain Gonzalo's eyebrows rise slightly—the only indication of surprise. Kings do not typically ask garrison commanders about budgets. But he recovers quickly, his mind shifting to the practical matters he knows intimately.\n\n\"Your Majesty wishes to understand the costs.\" He pauses, organizing his thoughts. \"I can speak to this, though Diego de Daza would have more precise figures.\"\n\nHe counts on his fingers, the gesture of a man more comfortable with swords than ledgers but competent nonetheless.\n\n\"One hundred fifty men. Six thousand florins. That is forty florins per man, per year.\"\n\nHe breaks it down:\n\n\"Wages: Thirty florins per man. Two and a half florins monthly. This is fair pay—enough to keep good men, not enough to attract glory-seekers who cause trouble. A man can feed a family on this, barely. They stay because the pay is steady, not because it is generous.\"\n\n\"Food and provisions: Five florins per man. We draw from royal stores when garrisoned, purchase locally when deployed. Bulk purchasing helps—one hundred fifty men eat cheaper per head than fifteen.\"\n\n\"Equipment maintenance: Three florins per man. Armor needs repair. Weapons dull. Boots wear through. We do not replace full kits yearly, but something always needs mending.\"\n\n\"Sundries: Two florins per man. Candles, rope, medicine, replacement cloaks, bribes to informants when needed, the thousand small costs of keeping soldiers in the field.\"\n\nHe spreads his hands.\n\n\"There is little fat to trim, Your Majesty. We do not feast. We do not parade in gilded armor. The men sleep four to a room when garrisoned, two to a tent when deployed. If you wished to save money, you could reduce wages—but then you would lose your best men to noble households or merchant guards, and keep only those too poor or too incompetent to find other employment.\"\n\nGonzalo pauses, considering the second part of the question more carefully.\n\n\"Two thousand men.\"\n\nHe takes a breath.\n\n\"The arithmetic is simple: two thousand men at forty florins is eighty thousand florins annually. But the true cost is higher.\"\n\nHe begins listing:\n\n\"Officers. One hundred fifty men need me, two sergeants, and a handful of corporals. Two thousand men need a proper command structure—perhaps ten captains, forty sergeants, a staff of clerks and quartermasters. Officers cost more than common soldiers. Add five thousand florins for officer pay.\"\n\n\"Initial equipment. Each new soldier needs kit: armor, weapons, boots, cloak, pack. Twenty-five to thirty florins per man for basic infantry equipment. For eighteen hundred and fifty new men, that is forty-six to fifty-five thousand florins—once, not annually, but a heavy blow to the treasury in the first year.\"\n\n\"Infrastructure. My one hundred fifty men fit into existing royal castles. Two thousand cannot. You would need barracks—purpose-built or converted—in several locations. Training grounds. Armories. Storehouses. Perhaps twenty thousand florins to establish, then ongoing maintenance.\"\n\n\"Recruitment. Finding one hundred fifty reliable men is not difficult. Finding two thousand...\" He shakes his head slowly. \"You would need recruitment across the kingdom. Signing bonuses to attract quality. Time to train raw recruits into soldiers. A year, perhaps two, before they are truly ready.\"\n\nHe tallies mentally.\n\n\"First year: eighty thousand in wages, plus fifty thousand in equipment, plus twenty thousand in infrastructure, plus five thousand in officer pay, plus perhaps ten thousand in recruitment and training. One hundred sixty-five thousand florins to establish. Thereafter, eighty-five thousand annually.\"\n\nGonzalo's expression grows more serious.\n\n\"Ten thousand men.\"\n\nA long pause.\n\n\"Your Majesty, ten thousand professional soldiers paid year-round would be... unprecedented. The French do not maintain such a force. The English cannot afford one. Even the great Italian condottieri companies rarely exceed five thousand, and they disband between contracts.\"\n\nHe works through the numbers slowly.\n\n\"Four hundred thousand florins in wages alone. Plus twenty-five thousand for officers—you would need generals now, not merely captains. Plus two hundred fifty thousand in initial equipment. Plus one hundred thousand or more in infrastructure—you are building a city for soldiers at that point, with its own supply chains, hospitals, training academies.\"\n\nHe meets Juan's eyes directly.\n\n\"Seven hundred fifty thousand florins in the first year. Perhaps four hundred fifty thousand annually thereafter.\"\n\nHe lets that sink in.\n\n\"But the cost in gold is not the greatest challenge, Your Majesty. The cost in men is. Where do you find ten thousand men willing to serve as professional soldiers? Not farmers—they are needed in the fields. Not craftsmen—they earn more at their trades. You would drain the kingdom of its young men, or you would recruit foreigners—and foreign soldiers have loyalties that can be... purchased.\"\n\nA pause.\n\n\"And there is the matter of purpose. One hundred fifty men garrison castles and escort treasuries. Two thousand men can enforce royal will across the kingdom, suppress rebellions, project power. But ten thousand men sitting idle become restless. They drink, they fight, they cause trouble. A standing army of that size needs a war to fight, or it becomes a danger to the crown it serves.\"\n\nHe straightens.\n\n\"If Your Majesty intends to campaign continuously—against Morocco, against the Ottomans, in Italy—then ten thousand professional soldiers becomes an investment rather than a burden. But if you raise such a force and then have nothing for them to do...\"\n\nHe trails off, the implication clear.\n\n\"May I ask what Your Majesty envisions?\"",

His weathered face shows something rare—genuine uncertainty. This is beyond his experience, beyond his training. He commands one hundred fifty men. The King speaks of facing forty thousand.\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" he says slowly, \"I am a garrison captain. I know how to hold a castle, escort a treasury, maintain discipline in a company of soldiers. What you speak of...\"\n\nHe shakes his head.\n\n\"I have heard of the Janissaries. Every soldier has. They say the Sultan takes Christian boys as tribute—tears them from their families, raises them as slaves who know no loyalty but to him. They train from childhood. They fight as one body, one mind. They have no wives, no lands, no divided loyalties. The Sultan is their family.\"\n\nGonzalo's voice carries a note of grim respect.\n\n\"Castile cannot do this. Our men have families, villages, obligations. They serve for pay, not because we stole them from their mothers as children. We cannot create Janissaries. And even if we could...\"\n\nHe pauses, something uncomfortable crossing his face.\n\n\"Would we want to, Your Majesty? Build an army of slave-soldiers loyal only to the crown? What happens when your heir is weak, or cruel, or simply unlucky—and forty thousand men with no other loyalty decide they prefer a different master?\"\n\nHe straightens, returning to firmer ground.\n\n\"But you ask how to match him. Perhaps the answer is not to match him soldier for soldier.\"\n\nGonzalo moves to the window, gazing out at the winter courtyard.\n\n\"I am no general, Your Majesty. But I have listened to men who are. Sir Thomas Beaumont speaks of English longbowmen who broke French cavalry—peasants defeating knights because they had the right weapon and the right ground. The Hussites in Bohemia, I am told, fight from wagon fortresses and defeat armored cavalry with handgonnes and crossbows.\"\n\nHe turns back.\n\n\"The Ottomans are fearsome in open battle. Their discipline, their numbers, their cavalry—these are real advantages. But they are not invincible. They were broken at Ankara by Timur, thirty years past. They have failed at sieges when the walls were strong and the defenders determined.\"\n\nHe hesitates, then speaks more carefully.\n\n\"Your Majesty has spoken with János Hunyadi, yes? The Hungarian who actually fights them? And Demetrios—the Greek who served in Constantinople? These men know the Ottomans as I know the roads between Toledo and Segovia. They could tell you where the Sultan is strong, and where he is weak.\"\n\nGonzalo folds his arms.\n\n\"If you asked me—a simple captain—I would say this: do not try to build what the Sultan has built. You cannot, and if you could, it would take a generation. Instead, build what Castile can build. Knights who fight for faith and glory. Artillery that breaks walls. Ships that control the seas—the Ottomans are not sailors, Your Majesty; their galleys are rowed by slaves who would flee if they could. Alliances that surround them—Hungary from the north, Byzantium from within, Castile from the west.\"\n\nHe shrugs, the gesture of a man reaching the limits of his knowledge.\n\n\"Forty thousand Janissaries cannot be everywhere at once. They cannot fight in Hungary and defend Constantinople and watch the Adriatic. Make the Sultan divide his forces, and then strike where he is weak.\"\n\nA pause.\n\n\"But these are questions for generals and kings, Your Majesty. Not garrison captains. I can tell you how to feed two thousand soldiers and keep them from deserting. How to defeat the Sultan...\"\n\nHe shakes his head.\n\n\"That is above my station.\"",

Álvaro de Luna, who has been quietly reviewing documents in the corner, sets aside his papers and approaches.\n\n\"Outstanding matters.\" He pulls a small ledger from his sleeve—Álvaro always has a ledger somewhere. \"Let me see.\"\n\nHe flips through pages.\n\n\"Morocco. Yes, Commander Martín returned in late autumn. I have his report here—I was waiting for an appropriate moment, given the Portuguese negotiations.\" He produces a folded document. \"The news is... mixed. Encouraging, but not triumphant.\"\n\nÁlvaro summarizes from memory:\n\n\"He established presence in two of the three target cities—Tangier and Tétouan. Salé remains too hostile; the corsairs there would not even speak with him. But in Tangier and Tétouan, the reception was cautiously receptive. His reputation preceded him—the honorable enemy who treated prisoners well during the conquest. The freed prisoners we sent home spoke well of Castilian treatment. This opened doors.\"\n\nHe glances at the report.\n\n\"A basic intelligence network is functioning. Twenty to twenty-two of our delegates remain in place, operating safely. Small trade is developing—nothing significant yet, but relationships are forming. The local emirs are weak, caught between the Sultan in Fez and their own ambitions. They are... curious about Castile. Not allies, not yet. But not enemies either.\"\n\nÁlvaro sets down the report.\n\n\"Commander Martín believes the foundation is laid, but expansion requires patience. Years, not months. He recommends continued small gestures—trade, respectful contact, occasional gifts to local leaders. He advises against military action until we better understand the political landscape. The wrong move could unite factions that currently quarrel with each other.\"\n\nÁlvaro flips to another page.\n\n\"The Dominicans. Fray Tomás de Torquemada and his brothers remain in Granada, preparing the apparatus as you instructed. They have secured buildings near the cathedral, trained familiares from among the Christian settlers, and prepared procedures and documents.\"\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\"They await the papal mandate. You intended to petition Pope Eugenius during your Rome visit—but of course, that journey was... overtaken by events in Naples and Constantinople. The petition has not yet been formally submitted.\"\n\nÁlvaro's expression is carefully neutral.\n\n\"Torquemada has written twice asking for guidance. He is eager to begin—perhaps too eager, in my estimation. But he follows your instruction that the Holy Office will not act until properly authorized. The apparatus exists, but it remains dormant.\"\n\nHe closes the ledger.\n\n\"Do you wish me to arrange a meeting with Torquemada before your departure? He could travel to Toledo within a week, or you could see him in Granada if your route takes you that way.\"\n\nA pause.\n\n\"Is there anything else, Your Majesty? The Portuguese treaty documents are being finalized—Dom Fernando and Diego have been working through the nights. King Duarte wishes to sign before he departs for Lisbon. And there is the matter of Admiral Ataíde's arrival in Seville—Vilaragut will need to be informed of the command arrangements.\"",

      "text": "1. To visit the Dominican priory himself to speak with Fray Alonso de Burgos\n2. To establish a cadre of warrior-priest bodyguards from the Order of Calatrava - about 10 men - to protect the royal family, working alongside Demetrios\n\nThis is an interesting development. The Varangian Guard comparison is apt - foreign warriors with no local ties who are utterly loyal to the ruler. The Calatrava knights would be different but could serve a similar function: men bound by religious vows whose loyalty is to God and the crown, not to noble factions.\n\nLet me have Álvaro respond to both points.\n\nFor the Calatrava guards:\n- Calatrava is a Military Order - warrior monks essentially\n- They have vows of obedience, chastity (though this was loosely observed), and poverty\n- They are already sworn to fight for Christ and the faith\n- Juan now has authority over the Military Orders thanks to the papal decree\n- 10 men is a small number - this shouldn't be difficult to arrange\n- The key is finding the RIGHT 10 men - absolutely dedicated, intelligent enough to learn Demetrios's shadow-warfare techniques\n\nThis is a good idea that Álvaro would probably support, though he might have some practical concerns about integrating religious knights with a Greek former-assassin.\n\nThe Solar — Toledo\n\nÁlvaro's eyebrows rise sharply. Then, slowly, a smile spreads across his weathered face.\n\n\"You will go yourself. To the Dominican priory.\" He chuckles softly. \"The friars will not know what to make of it. Kings summon priests; they do not walk to their doors uninvited.\"\n\nHe waves a hand dismissively. \"But that is your way, and it has served you well. I will arrange a small escort—nothing ostentatious. Captain Fernán can have men ready within the hour.\"\n\nBut it is the second idea that truly captures Álvaro's attention. He stops near the door, turning back with a calculating gleam in his eyes.\n\n\"Warrior priests. Calatrava knights as a personal guard.\" He speaks slowly, testing the concept. \"Not merely soldiers who happen to be faithful. Not merely priests who happen to fight. But men whose very identity is both warrior and holy man, sworn to vows that transcend feudal loyalty.\"\n\nHe begins pacing again—his thinking habit.\n\n\"The Varangians served the Byzantine emperors for five centuries because they had no ties to court factions. No families in Constantinople to threaten. No lands to covet. No ambition beyond their oath. They were outside the web of politics, and thus incorruptible by it.\"\n\nÁlvaro nods slowly.\n\n\"Calatrava knights are similar. They are sworn to poverty—they cannot be bribed with gold they are forbidden to keep. They are sworn to chastity—they have no wives or children who can be threatened. They are sworn to obedience—to God, to the Order, and now, by papal decree, to you as master of all the Military Orders.\"\n\nHe stops pacing, facing Juan directly.\n\n\"Ten men. Hand-selected for intelligence, not merely martial skill. Men who can learn what Demetrios teaches—the watching, the suspicion, the shadow arts. Men whose faith makes them incorruptible and whose training makes them lethal.\"\n\nA pause.\n\n\"It is brilliant, Your Majesty. But it requires careful selection. Not all Calatrava knights are suited to this. Many are second sons of nobles, serving their required years before returning to secular life. You need men who have chosen the Order as their true calling. Men whose faith burns hot enough to sustain them through the... moral complexities of what Demetrios will teach them.\"\n\nÁlvaro strokes his chin.\n\n\"The Master of Calatrava—Don Pedro González de Padilla—would know which brothers fit this description. He fought beside you for two years; he understands what you value in men. Shall I write to him? Or would you prefer to select them personally when you pass through Calatrava lands on your way to Barcelona?\"\n\nHe hesitates, then adds more carefully:\n\n\"There is one complication. Demetrios is... Greek. Orthodox. Some of the more rigid brothers may bristle at learning the arts of protection from a man they consider schismatic. The selection must account for this—men who value competence over theological purity, at least in matters of practical survival.\"",

He would see both the advantages and the risks. He might suggest starting small and letting the institution grow organically rather than creating elaborate structures for just ten men.\n\nI should have Álvaro engage thoughtfully with this idea, presenting both possibilities and concerns, but ultimately supporting Juan's vision while offering practical guidance.\n\nThe Solar — Toledo\n\nÁlvaro is quiet for a long moment. His eyes have taken on that distant look he gets when he is thinking several moves ahead—not merely solving the immediate problem, but seeing its implications across years and decades.\n\n\"A separate name. A separate institution.\" He speaks the words slowly, tasting them. \"You are not merely thinking of ten bodyguards, are you, Your Majesty? You are thinking of something that outlasts you. Something that protects your son, and his son, and his son's son.\"\n\nHe moves to the window, gazing out at Toledo's ancient walls.\n\n\"The Varangians began as a few hundred Norse mercenaries. By the time Constantinople fell into its current misery, they had served for five centuries. They had their own barracks, their own traditions, their own identity. Emperors came and went; the Varangians remained.\"\n\nÁlvaro turns back.\n\n\"If you create such an institution—give it a name, a charter, a purpose beyond your personal protection—you create something that can grow. Ten men today. Fifty in a decade. A hundred in a generation. An institution with its own memory, its own standards, its own loyalty to the crown rather than merely to the man who wears it.\"\n\nHe begins pacing again, thinking aloud.\n\n\"But there are dangers. The Military Orders began as humble brotherhoods protecting pilgrims. Now they are powers unto themselves, with lands and armies that rival kings. If you create a new order within Calatrava—or beside it—you must bind it tightly to the crown from the very beginning. No lands. No independent income. No authority except what flows from the monarch they protect.\"\n\nÁlvaro stops, facing Juan.\n\n\"A name. Yes, they should have a name. Something that speaks to their purpose.\" He considers. \"The Papal Swiss Guard are simply 'the Swiss Guard.' The Varangians were 'the Varangians'—foreigners, axe-bearers, northmen. What are your men?\"\n\nHe offers possibilities:\n\n\"Los Guardianes de la Fe—the Guardians of the Faith. It speaks to their religious nature, their holy purpose.\"\n\n\"Los Caballeros del Defensor—the Knights of the Defender. It ties them to your title, to the office rather than the man.\"\n\n\"La Orden del Escudo—the Order of the Shield. Simple. Clear. They are the shield that stands between the crown and its enemies.\"\n\n\"Los Hermanos de la Sombra—the Brothers of the Shadow. More... honest about what Demetrios will teach them. Though perhaps too honest for public consumption.\"\n\nÁlvaro shrugs.\n\n\"As for institution—I would counsel patience. Begin with ten men. Let them train under Demetrios. Let them prove themselves. Let traditions form organically before you codify them in charters. A name, yes. A separate identity, yes. But a full institution with rules and hierarchies and recruitment procedures?\"\n\nHe shakes his head slowly.\n\n\"That comes later, when you know what works. The Varangians did not have a charter when they first swore to Emperor Basil. They simply were. The charter came after centuries of service.\"\n\nA pause.\n\n\"Select the ten. Give them a name. House them separately from the regular guard. Let Demetrios shape them. And in five years, ten years, you will know what institution should grow from that seed.\"\n\nHe tilts his head.\n\n\"What would you call them, Your Majesty?\"",

Juan walks among his people like a pilgrim rather than a monarch. A few recognize him; most do not. Those who do fall to their knees, crossing themselves, murmuring blessings.\n\nThe priory of Santo Domingo el Real rises ahead—a complex of stone buildings clustered around a modest church, its bell tower reaching toward the gray winter sky. It is not grand like the cathedral, but there is a quiet dignity to it. The walls are clean, the grounds well-tended. A group of friars in black and white habits crosses the courtyard, their voices raised in quiet discussion.\n\nAt the gate, a young novice looks up from his sweeping. His eyes widen as he takes in the escort, the bearing of the man at its center. The broom clatters to the ground.\n\n\"Your—Your Majesty—\"\n\nHe falls to his knees, trembling.\n\n\"I—we—the prior is—please, I will fetch him immediately—\"\n\nThe boy scrambles to his feet and runs into the priory, habit flapping behind him.

He is lean—the Dominicans practice genuine austerity, unlike some orders—but there is strength in his frame. His eyes are keen, intelligent, and currently filled with barely-concealed astonishment.\n\nHe approaches Juan with measured steps, neither rushing nor delaying. His bow is correct, respectful, but not servile.\n\n\"Your Majesty.\" His voice is calm, steady—a preacher's voice, trained to carry without shouting. \"Santo Domingo el Real is honored beyond measure by your presence. I am Fray Alonso de Burgos, prior of this house.\"\n\nHe straightens, studying Juan with those scholar's eyes.\n\n\"Forgive the confusion—we do not often receive kings unannounced. If Your Majesty had sent word, we would have prepared a proper welcome. As it is...\"\n\nHe gestures to the stunned friars gathering in the courtyard.\n\n\"You find us as we are. Brothers at prayer, at study, at work. No ceremony. No pretense.\"\n\nA slight smile crosses his weathered face.\n\n\"Perhaps that is what Your Majesty intended?\"\n\nHe gestures toward the main building.\n\n\"Will you come inside?

The studium here in Toledo trains young friars in theology, philosophy, Scripture. San Esteban in Salamanca is one of the great theological schools of Christendom. We have produced more doctors of the Church than any order save the Franciscans—and we would dispute even that.\" A flicker of scholarly pride crosses his face, quickly suppressed.\n\n\"Third, we write. Commentaries on Scripture. Theological treatises. Manuals for confessors. Guides for preachers. Brother Thomas Aquinas was one of ours—his Summa Theologica is the foundation of all serious theological study. We believe that truth, properly articulated, is the greatest weapon against error.\"\n\nHe pauses, his expression softening.\n\n\"Fourth, we care for the suffering. This priory maintains a hospital for the poor—those who cannot afford physicians, who would otherwise die in the streets. We feed the hungry when we can. We visit prisoners. We comfort the dying. This is not our primary mission, but it is... necessary. How can we preach God's love to those who see only God's absence in their misery?\"\n\nFray Alonso meets Juan's eyes directly.\n\n\"Fifth, we advise. Bishops, nobles, kings—those who shape the world often seek counsel from those who have studied it. We serve as confessors, as consultants, as voices of conscience when conscience is inconvenient.\" A slight, dry smile. \"Not all welcome such counsel. But we offer it nonetheless.\"\n\nHe spreads his hands.\n\n\"And yes, sixth—the Inquisition. When the Church requires it, we investigate heresy. We examine the accused. We determine truth from falsehood. It is grim work, Your Majesty. Necessary, perhaps, but grim. I will not pretend otherwise.\"\n\nHe falls silent for a moment, studying Juan with those keen scholar's eyes.\n\n\"That is what we do. Preach. Teach. Write. Heal. Advise. And when required, judge.\" He tilts his head slightly. \"But I suspect Your Majesty did not walk to our priory in the February cold to hear a catalogue of Dominican activities. What is it you truly wish to discuss?\"",

      "text": "Fray Alonso should respond thoughtfully. He's a scholarly, practical man - not as intense as Torquemada. He would likely be surprised and pleased by this offer, but also cautious. He would think carefully about what genuine support would look like.\n\nHe might mention:\n- Funding for more hospitals, schools\n- Protection for friars who preach in remote areas\n- Support for their educational mission\n- Perhaps help reaching populations that are underserved\n- The challenge of reaching the poor in isolated villages\n\nHe should be genuine but not immediately ask for everything. A wise prior would want to understand the king's motives before making requests.\n\nThe Chapter House — Santo Domingo el Real\n\nFray Alonso is silent for a long moment. His keen eyes search Juan's face—looking, perhaps, for the calculation that usually underlies royal generosity. Kings do not offer support without expecting something in return.\n\nWhatever he sees seems to satisfy him, at least partially. He leans back, considering.\n\n\"That is... not a question we are often asked, Your Majesty.\" A slight, wondering smile. \"Usually we are told what the crown requires of us. To pray for victory. To preach obedience. To bless this campaign or that treaty. Support flows from us to the throne, not the reverse.\"\n\nHe rises and moves to the fire, warming his hands as he thinks.\n\n\"If you ask what we need...\" He speaks slowly, choosing words with care. \"I would say this: we are stretched thin. The Order has perhaps three hundred friars in Castile. Three hundred men to preach to three million souls. We cannot be everywhere. We cannot reach everyone.\"\n\nHe turns back to Juan.\n\n\"The great cities are served well enough. Toledo, Burgos, Valladolid, Seville—there are priories, churches, schools. But the villages? The remote valleys of Asturias, the scattered farms of Extremadura, the mountain hamlets where a priest visits once a year if at all?\" He shakes his head. \"These people are baptized Christians who have never heard a proper sermon. Who cannot recite the Creed. Who mix the faith with old superstitions because no one has taught them better.\"\n\nFray Alonso returns to his seat.\n\n\"Gold helps, of course. It always does. More friars require more food, more books, more buildings to house them. Our hospital here turns away ten sick poor for every one we can treat—not from lack of will, but lack of beds, lack of medicines, lack of hands to tend them.\"\n\nHe holds up a weathered hand.\n\n\"But gold alone is not enough. We can only train so many friars. The formation takes years—theology, philosophy, Scripture, preaching. We cannot simply hire men off the street and call them Dominicans.\"\n\nHe pauses, his expression thoughtful.\n\n\"What would help most, Your Majesty, is reach. Ways to extend our presence beyond what our numbers allow.\"\n\nHe ticks off on his fingers:\n\n\"First: safe passage. Friars who travel to remote villages sometimes meet... difficulties. Bandits. Suspicious local lords who see outside priests as threats to their authority. A royal letter of protection—something that marks our traveling preachers as under the crown's shield—would allow us to go where we currently cannot.\"\n\n\"Second: partnership with parish priests. Many village priests are barely literate. They mean well, but they cannot teach what they do not know. If we could train them—short courses, a few weeks each year, here in Toledo or in regional centers—they could carry our teaching back to their flocks. We multiply our reach tenfold without requiring tenfold more Dominicans.\"\n\n\"Third: the hospitals. We have one here in Toledo. There could be more—in Seville, in Burgos, in the new settlements of Granada. Places where the poor can receive care and hear the Gospel. Where healing of the body accompanies healing of the soul. But such institutions require not just gold to build, but ongoing support to maintain.\"\n\nFray Alonso hesitates, then adds more quietly:\n\n\"Fourth: protection from... interference. Not all bishops welcome our presence in their dioceses. We answer to our own Master General in Rome, not to local prelates, and some resent this. A word from the crown—making clear that Dominican work has royal favor—would smooth many paths.\"\n\nHe falls silent, studying Juan again with those penetrating eyes.\n\n\"I have answered your question, Your Majesty. But I find myself curious about the question behind the question.\" He speaks carefully, without presumption. \"Kings support the Church for many reasons. Piety. Politics. The salvation of their souls. The stability of their realms.\"\n\nHe leans forward slightly.\n\n\"Why does the King of Castile walk unannounced to a modest priory and ask how he might help Dominican friars preach to peasants and heal the sick poor? What is it you truly seek to build?\"",

I need to have Fray Alonso respond thoughtfully to these ideas - he's a scholar, a man of the cloth, someone who cares about the poor and about proper theology. He should be intrigued but also careful, perhaps raising some concerns or asking clarifying questions.\n\nI should NOT generate any dialogue or action for Juan. I should stop after Fray Alonso speaks and let the player respond.\n\nLet me craft Fray Alonso's response. He would be:\n- Genuinely moved by Juan's vision\n- Theologically careful about the \"kingdom of heaven\" language\n- Practically minded about implementation\n- Aware of the complexities around foundling homes and orphanages\n- Interested in the settlements abroad\n- Perhaps raising the tension between charity and the complexities of \"unwanted\" children\n\nI'll have him respond substantively and then stop, waiting for Juan's response.\n\nThe Chapter House — Santo Domingo el Real\n\nFray Alonso is very still. The fire crackles softly in the silence.\n\nWhen he speaks, his voice has changed—softer, more wondering. The careful scholarly detachment has cracked, revealing something more human beneath.\n\n\"The kingdom of heaven.\" He repeats the words slowly. \"Your Majesty, I have counseled lords and bishops for thirty years. They speak of power, of order, of stability. They invoke God's name to bless their ambitions. But they do not speak of building the kingdom of heaven. Not... not like this.\"\n\nHe rises and moves to a small window, gazing out at the fading winter light.\n\n\"What you describe—caring for the poor, saving children who would otherwise perish, spreading the faith to new lands—this is not statecraft as kings usually practice it. This is...\" He pauses, searching for words. \"This is what the Church should be doing. What we too often fail to do because we lack resources, lack protection, lack a champion with the power to make it real.\"\n\nHe turns back, his eyes bright with something that might be hope—or might be caution.\n\n\"Orphanages. Foundling homes. Yes.\" He nods slowly. \"In Rome, in Florence, in Venice—such institutions exist. The Ospedale degli Innocenti in Florence takes in abandoned infants, raises them, teaches them trades. It is funded by the wool guild and blessed by the Church. Hundreds of children who would have died in gutters instead grow to become workers, craftsmen, even priests and nuns.\"\n\nFray Alonso returns to his seat, leaning forward intently.\n\n\"In Castile, we have... less. Some monasteries take in orphans. Some convents raise abandoned girls. But it is haphazard, dependent on local charity, insufficient to the need. Every city has women who—\" He hesitates, choosing words carefully. \"Who find themselves with child and no husband, no family, no means of support. Some leave their infants at church doors, hoping for mercy. Some...\"\n\nHe does not finish the sentence. He does not need to.\n\n\"If the crown were to establish such institutions—properly funded, properly staffed, with Dominican brothers and sisters to provide both care and Christian education—many lives could be saved. Children who would have died or grown up as beggars could instead become productive Christians. Settlers for your new lands, even.\"\n\nBut now a note of caution enters his voice.\n\n\"However, Your Majesty, I must speak frankly on certain matters.\"\n\nHe folds his hands carefully.\n\n\"First: the tensions I mentioned. If the crown simply decrees that Dominicans shall go everywhere and do everything, you will create resentment. Bishops who feel their authority undermined. Parish priests who feel judged and replaced. Local lords who suspect outside friars of reporting on them to Toledo. The work must be framed as partnership, not imposition. We come to help, not to supplant.\"\n\n\"Second: foundling homes are... complicated. The Church teaches that every child is a gift from God. Yet if we make it too easy to abandon children, do we not encourage the sin that created them? There must be... discretion. Women who leave children must not be celebrated for it. The homes must be places of last resort, not first convenience.\"\n\n\"Third: you speak of increasing children, of populating settlements. This is a noble goal. But children require families, Your Majesty. A foundling raised by friars is better than a foundling dead in a ditch, but better still is a child raised by a mother and father in a Christian home. If you wish to increase the children of the kingdom, the greater work is ensuring that families can afford children. That fathers have work. That mothers do not die in childbirth. That villages have enough food to feed another mouth.\"\n\nHe pauses, then adds more gently:\n\n\"The orphanages save those who fall through the cracks. But the true work—the work that builds the kingdom of heaven—is making the cracks smaller.\"\n\nFray Alonso studies Juan with renewed intensity.\n\n\"What resources does Your Majesty envision committing to this? And where would you wish to begin—here in Castile, or in the new settlements abroad?\"",

He would likely:\n- Agree that this aligns with Church teaching\n- Point out that the Church already preaches this to some degree\n- Perhaps note that preaching alone won't solve the problem if material conditions don't support larger families\n- Possibly express some caution about the framing or approach\n\nI should have him respond thoughtfully, perhaps with some agreement but also with practical observations about what would make such preaching effective versus hollow.\n\nRemember: I must NOT generate dialogue or actions for Juan. I should end with Fray Alonso's response and wait for the player's next input.\n\nThe Chapter House — Santo Domingo el Real\n\nFray Alonso nods slowly, a scholar's appreciation for methodical thinking crossing his features.\n\n\"You would hear the objections before deciding.

Wiser than many who sit on thrones.\" He allows himself a slight smile. \"I can tell you what the bishops will say, what the parish priests will mutter, what the local lords will whisper.

The Church has always taught that marriage exists for the procreation and raising of children in the faith. Crescite et multiplicamini—be fruitful and multiply. It is Scripture itself.\"\n\nHe settles back onto his bench.\n\n\"But I take your meaning. You wish us to emphasize it. To make it central rather than incidental. To speak of large families not merely as permitted, but as holy. As service to God and kingdom alike.\"\n\nFray Alonso considers for a moment.\n\n\"This can be done. And it would not be false—it is God's work to raise children in the faith. Every baptized soul is a victory for Christ. Every child taught the Creed and the Commandments is a light against the darkness.\"\n\nHe holds up a cautionary finger.\n\n\"But words without deeds ring hollow, Your Majesty.

They will hear mockery.\"\n\nHis voice softens.\n\n\"If you wish this message to take root, it must be accompanied by visible change. The hospitals I mentioned—mothers who do not die in childbirth because a trained midwife attended them. The orphanages—children who survive because there is somewhere for the desperate to turn. Food enough that another mouth does not mean another grave.\"\n\nHe leans forward.\n\n\"Give us those things to point to, Your Majesty, and our preaching will be believed. The peasant wife who watched her neighbor's child saved by the Dominican hospital will hear 'children are God's work' and think, 'Yes, I have seen it.'

Faith must be built on something.\"\n\nA pause.\n\n\"I do not say this to discourage you.

Absentee clergy - benefice holders who collect income but don't actually serve\n4. Poorly trained priests - many parish priests are barely literate themselves\n5. Old traditions/superstitions mixed with Christianity\n6. The aftermath of the Black Death - depopulation left some areas without clergy\n\nI should have Fray Alonso explain this carefully and honestly.\n\nThe Chapter House — Santo Domingo el Real\n\nFray Alonso's expression shifts—something between sorrow and old frustration crossing his weathered features.\n\n\"Your Majesty asks a question that has troubled me for thirty years.\"\n\nHe rises and moves to the window, gazing out at Toledo's rooftops as the winter light fades toward evening.\n\n\"It is not one reason. It is many, tangled together like roots beneath a dying tree.\"\n\nHe begins to count on his fingers, his voice taking on the measured cadence of a man who has thought long on this subject.\n\n\"First: distance. Castile is vast. In the mountains of Asturias, in the high valleys of León, in the empty stretches of Extremadura—there are villages a day's walk from the nearest church. A peasant cannot abandon his fields every Sunday to walk ten miles each way. He will starve. So he stays home, says what prayers he remembers, and hopes God understands.\"\n\n\"Second: poverty. A parish requires a priest. A priest requires support—food, shelter, a stipend however modest. This comes from tithes, from the village itself. But what of villages with thirty souls? Fifty? They cannot support a priest. They share one with three other villages, and he visits once a month if the weather holds. The rest of the time, they have no one.\"\n\nHe turns back, his eyes heavy.\n\n\"Third: the benefice system.\" His voice grows harder. \"Your Majesty, I must speak frankly, even if it reflects poorly on Holy Mother Church. Many parishes exist as benefices—sources of income attached to a position. Wealthy churchmen, nobles' younger sons, even foreign cardinals hold these benefices. They collect the tithes. But they do not serve. They hire a vicar for a pittance—some half-literate peasant who can barely mumble the Mass—and pocket the rest. The village gets a man who cannot preach, cannot teach, cannot counsel. A warm body in a cassock, nothing more.\"\n\nFray Alonso returns to his seat, his movements tired.\n\n\"Fourth: the priests themselves. Even those who serve in good faith—many are poorly trained. They learned the Mass by rote from another poorly trained priest. They cannot read Latin, only sound it out. They do not understand the theology they are meant to teach. They know the rituals, but not the meaning. And so their flocks know only rituals as well—gestures without understanding, words without faith.\"\n\n\"Fifth: the old ways.\" His voice drops. \"In the remote places, Your Majesty, Christianity is... thin. A veneer over something older. The peasants are baptized, yes. They call themselves Christians. But they also leave offerings at ancient stones. They whisper charms against the evil eye. They fear the duende and the moura more than they fear the Devil. Because no one has ever taught them otherwise. No one has ever told them that Christ is stronger than the spirits of the wood.\"\n\nHe spreads his hands.\n\n\"And sixth: the Black Death.\" The words hang heavy in the air. \"Eighty years ago, a third of Christendom died. Whole villages were emptied. Priests died alongside their flocks—sometimes first, because they went to give last rites. In a single generation, we lost thousands of trained clergy. We have never fully recovered. There are still parishes that have not had a permanent priest since the Great Mortality.\"\n\nFray Alonso meets Juan's eyes directly.\n\n\"So when you ask why people do not go to Mass—it is because there is no Mass to attend. Or the Mass is a half-day's journey away. Or the priest who says it is a drunkard who cannot explain why it matters. Or the people have forgotten, across generations, that the faith is anything more than a few gestures to ward off bad luck.\"\n\nHe pauses, then adds quietly:\n\n\"This is the true state of Christ's kingdom in Castile, Your Majesty. The cathedrals gleam. The bishops grow fat. The theologians dispute angels on pinheads. And in the mountains, old women teach their granddaughters to pray to saints who were never saints at all, because no one has ever given them anything better.\"\n\nA long silence.\n\n\"If you wish to change this—truly change it—it is the work of a lifetime. Perhaps many lifetimes. Churches must be built where there are none. Priests must be trained who can actually teach. The benefice system must be reformed—and that means fighting bishops, cardinals, perhaps Rome itself. The Dominicans can help. We can preach, we can train parish priests, we can go where others will not. But we cannot do it alone.\"\n\nHe looks at Juan with something like hope, but tempered by decades of disappointment.\n\n\"Do you understand what you are proposing to undertake, Your Majesty? This is not a campaign that ends with a siege and a treaty. This is a war that never ends—a war for souls, fought village by village, generation by generation.\"",

Foundation is laid, but expansion requires patience.\n\nNow I need to create a d100 table for the current situation - this would be an update on how things have developed since the initial report (the 71 roll was for October/November 1433). Now we're in February 1435, so about 15-16 months have passed since the initial assessment. The question is: how has the network developed over this additional time?\n\nLet me draft a d100 table for the current state of the Morocco intelligence operation.\n\nThe Solar — Toledo\n\nJuan returns from the Dominican priory as evening falls, his mind full of hospitals and orphanages and villages that have forgotten how to pray. Álvaro is waiting with the Morocco report, a sealed packet bearing Commander Martín's distinctive mark.\n\n\"The full report, Your Majesty. I summarized earlier, but you should read the details yourself.\"\n\nD100 TABLE: MOROCCO INTELLIGENCE MISSION — CURRENT STATUS (February 1435)\n\nContext: Commander Martín's mission departed April 1433. The initial assessment (Roll 71 — Moderate Success) established presence in Tangier and Tétouan, with Salé remaining hostile. A basic intelligence network was functioning with 20-22 delegates operating safely. Small trade was developing. Now, nearly two years later, the question is: how has the operation evolved?\n\nSuccess Factors:\n\nInitial mission succeeded (Roll 71)\n\nCommander Martín's reputation as honorable enemy opened doors\n\nFernando (Ahmad al-Zarqali) provides scholarly credibility and connections\n\nFreed Moroccan prisoners spread goodwill\n\nMarinid Sultanate fragmented—local governors seek outside support\n\nTrade goods flowing (steel, leather, silk)\n\nTwo years to develop relationships and networks\n\nFailure Factors:\n\nSalé corsairs remain hostile and influential\n\nOperating in foreign, potentially hostile territory\n\nMarinid political situation unstable and dangerous\n\nDiscovery could mean death for all delegates\n\nLimited resources and backup\n\nDistance makes communication and support difficult\n\nLocal factions may have turned suspicious over time\n\nRoll\nResult\n1-5\nCatastrophic Collapse. The network has been exposed. Commander Martín sends desperate word: several delegates have been arrested or killed. He and Fernando are in hiding, attempting to flee to Ceuta. The two years of work are lost, and worse—the Moroccan authorities now know Castile was spying on them. Relations poisoned for a generation.\n6-15\nSerious Setback. A faction shift in Tétouan has turned dangerous. The new governor is suspicious of the Castilian traders. Five delegates have fled; three are missing. The Tangier operation survives but is compromised—contacts are afraid to meet. Martín recommends pulling out entirely and waiting years before trying again.\n16-25\nStagnation. The network exists but has not grown. The same contacts, the same small trade, the same limited intelligence. Local political chaos makes everyone cautious. Martín reports frustration—doors that seemed ready to open have remained shut. The foundation holds, but nothing has been built upon it.\n26-40\nModest Progress. The network has expanded slightly. A few new contacts in Tangier, better trade relationships, more detailed intelligence on local politics. Martín has identified which factions might be amenable to Castilian influence, but has not yet approached them. Salé remains completely hostile. Slow, careful work continues.\n41-55\nSolid Development. Two years of patient work have paid off. The network now includes reliable contacts in both Tangier and Tétouan, including minor officials and merchant families. Trade has grown to several hundred florins annually. Martín has mapped the political landscape thoroughly—he knows who hates whom, who might be bought, who is loyal to the boy Sultan. Ready for the next phase, if Juan wishes to proceed.\n56-70\nStrong Position. The network has exceeded expectations. Contacts now include a minor governor's secretary in Tangier and a qadi's assistant in Tétouan. Intelligence flows regularly—ship movements, political intrigues, military dispositions. Trade covers operational costs. Fernando has established himself as a respected scholar, opening doors Martín alone could not. Several local figures have quietly expressed interest in Castilian friendship.\n71-80\nExcellent Results. The operation has become self-sustaining. Trade profits fund further expansion. Contacts reach into both governors' households. Martín reports that one faction—the Wattasids, who oppose the weak Marinid Sultan—have made discreet inquiries about Castilian support. Salé's corsairs remain hostile, but Martín has identified rivals within the city who resent corsair dominance. Opportunities are ripening.\n81-90\nRemarkable Success. Martín has achieved something unexpected: a secret meeting with a Wattasid prince who controls territory south of Tangier. The prince is desperate for allies against both the Marinid Sultan and rival factions. He has proposed a formal arrangement—Castilian military support in exchange for trading rights and port access. This could be the vassal relationship Juan envisioned. Additionally, contacts in Salé report that the corsair leadership is fracturing over a succession dispute.\n91-95\nStrategic Breakthrough. Multiple factions are now actively courting Castilian favor. The Wattasids offer vassalage in exchange for military support. The governor of Tétouan has secretly approached Martín about switching allegiance if Castile can guarantee his position. Even in Salé, a dissident faction has reached out—they would welcome Castilian intervention against the current corsair chiefs. Martín reports that with modest military force, Castile could reshape the entire region. The question is no longer whether opportunities exist, but which to pursue.\n96-100\nTransformative Opportunity. The Marinid Sultanate is collapsing faster than anyone predicted. The boy Sultan has been effectively deposed by Wattasid forces; civil war looms. In this chaos, Martín has performed a masterstroke: he has negotiated a secret agreement with the governor of Tangier, who will declare for Castile if Juan provides military backing and guarantees his position. Tangier—the key to the Strait—could fall into Castilian hands without a siege, if Juan moves quickly. Tétouan's governor is wavering and may follow. Even Salé's corsairs are paralyzed by internal conflict. The window is narrow—months, perhaps only weeks—but Morocco lies open.\n\nReady to roll when you are, Your Majesty.",

      "text": "The Solar — Toledo\n\nÁlvaro hands Juan the sealed packet. The wax bears Commander Martín's mark—a crescent moon bisected by a cross, the symbol he adopted after his conversion.\n\nInside, several pages of close-written text in Martín's careful hand. The tone is markedly different from his earlier reports.\n\nReport of Commander Martín\nTétouan, January of Our Lord 1435\nTo His Majesty Juan II of Castile, Defender of the Faith\n\nYour Majesty,\n\nI write with a heavy heart. Not because we have failed—we have not. But because we have not succeeded as I had hoped.\n\nThe network survives. All twenty-two delegates remain safe and in position. Our cover as merchants holds. The small trade in steel, leather, and silk continues, generating enough revenue to sustain our presence. Fernando has made friends among the learned men of Tétouan and is respected as a scholar of unusual depth.\n\nBut that is all.\n\nIn two years, we have not advanced beyond where we stood after six months. The contacts we cultivated remain contacts—they share gossip over coffee, they trade goods at fair prices, they warn us when the mood in the souk turns suspicious. But they do not trust us with secrets. They do not open doors to men of power. They do not speak of alliances or arrangements.\n\nI have asked myself why, and I believe I understand.\n\nMorocco is chaos, Your Majesty. Not the chaos of war—that, at least, creates opportunities. This is the chaos of paralysis. The boy Sultan sits in Fez and commands nothing. The Wattasid viziers rule in his name but fight among themselves. The governors of Tangier and Tétouan watch and wait, unwilling to commit to any faction lest they choose wrong. The corsairs of Salé raid whom they please and answer to no one.\n\nEvery man of influence I have approached listens politely, nods thoughtfully, and then... does nothing. They are afraid. Not of us—of each other. To be seen dealing with Christians is dangerous when no one knows who will hold power tomorrow. A governor who welcomes Castilian friendship today may be denounced as a traitor next month by whoever emerges from the endless Wattasid intrigues.\n\nI had thought that chaos would create opportunity. Instead, it has created caution. Everyone waits for someone else to move first. No one moves.\n\nFernando has had similar experiences among the scholars. They admire his learning, they debate theology with genuine interest, they even express private sympathy for the Christian position on certain matters. But when he hints at deeper cooperation—intellectual exchanges, perhaps, or introductions to men of affairs—they grow vague. \"Perhaps someday,\" they say. \"When things are more settled.\"\n\nThings are never settled.\n\nSalé remains impossible. The corsairs rule there absolutely, and they hate us with a pure and uncomplicated hatred. Our one attempt to cultivate a contact there ended badly—the man was beaten and warned that speaking to \"Castilian dogs\" would cost him his life. We have not tried again.\n\nI do not recommend abandoning the mission. The foundation we have built is real. The contacts may yet prove valuable if circumstances change. But I cannot promise progress, Your Majesty. I can only promise patience.\n\nWe will continue to watch. To listen. To maintain our presence. And if the paralysis ever breaks—if some faction grows desperate enough to seek outside help—we will be positioned to respond.\n\nBut that day may be years away. Or it may never come.\n\nI remain Your Majesty's faithful servant,\n\nCommander Martín of Toledo\nFormerly of Granada\n\nÁlvaro waits as Juan finishes reading.\n\n\"Not what we hoped,\" he says quietly. \"But not disaster either. Martín is right—Morocco is frozen. Until someone there decides to move, we cannot force their hand. Not without conquest, and conquest would cost more than it would gain.\"\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\"Do you wish to continue funding the operation? Six hundred florins annually, more or less. It buys us eyes and ears, even if those eyes see only stalemate and those ears hear only whispers.\"",

Historically, she died on February 2, 1435 - so actually she's already dead by the current game date (late February 1435)!\n\nHowever, this is an alternate history, so we can adjust. The player wants to know how much longer she survives. Alfonso V of Aragon has claims to Naples and has been named her heir (though she changed her heir multiple times historically).\n\nLet me create a d100 table for how long she survives from the current date (late February 1435). Given her advanced age and historical death date, the table should weight toward her dying soon, but allow for some variance in an alternate timeline.\n\nSuccess factors for her surviving longer:\n- She's proven resilient historically\n- Has survived assassination attempts and political turmoil\n- Still has a functioning court\n\nFailure factors (reasons she might die soon):\n- Very old for medieval era (61-62)\n- Historically died February 1435\n- Stressful political situation\n- No heirs of her body, succession disputes\n\nI'll create a table that reflects the reality that she's very likely to die soon, but gives some range of outcomes.\n\nD100 TABLE: QUEEN GIOVANNA II OF NAPLES — SURVIVAL\n\nContext: Queen Giovanna II has ruled Naples since 1414. She is now sixty-one or sixty-two years old—ancient by medieval standards. She has survived assassination attempts, civil wars, and endless succession intrigues. She has named and un-named heirs repeatedly, most recently favoring Alfonso V of Aragon over René of Anjou. Alfonso has been preparing for years to claim his inheritance. The question is: when does that inheritance come due?\n\nFactors Favoring Longer Survival:\n\nHas proven remarkably resilient throughout her reign\n\nSurvived multiple crises that should have killed her\n\nStill maintains a functioning court\n\nStubbornness seems to sustain her\n\nFactors Favoring Shorter Survival:\n\nExtremely old for the era (61-62)\n\nHealth has been declining for years\n\nStressful political situation with competing heirs\n\nNo children of her own body; succession pressure constant\n\nReports suggest she has grown frail\n\nRoll\nResult\n1-15\nAlready Dead. Word has not yet reached Toledo, but Giovanna died in late January or early February 1435. A messenger is even now riding north with the news. Alfonso's moment has come—Naples is his to claim, if he can hold it against René of Anjou. The succession crisis begins immediately.\n16-30\nDies Within Weeks. Giovanna clings to life but barely. She will not see Easter. By late March or early April 1435, Naples will have a new ruler—or a war to determine one. Alfonso must move quickly.\n31-45\nDies by Summer 1435. The queen survives the winter but fades as the weather warms. She dies in May or June 1435, giving Alfonso time to position himself but also giving René of Anjou time to prepare a counterclaim. The succession contest will be closely fought.\n46-60\nDies by Autumn 1435. Giovanna proves more resilient than expected, lasting through summer before succumbing in September or October. This gives all parties time to prepare—Alfonso, René, the Neapolitan nobles who will ultimately decide who sits on the throne. A long, bloody contest seems likely.\n61-75\nDies by Winter 1435/36. Against all expectations, the old queen survives another year, dying in late 1435 or early 1436. The extended timeline allows for more diplomatic maneuvering, more alliance-building, more preparation. When the end comes, both claimants will be fully ready for war.\n76-85\nSurvives Through 1436. Giovanna defies mortality, lasting well into 1436 before finally succumbing. Her extended survival frustrates Alfonso, who has been preparing for years. But it also gives Juan more time to consolidate his own position before being drawn into the Neapolitan succession.\n86-93\nSurvives Into 1437. The queen seems preserved by pure spite. She lives on and on, confounding physicians and heirs alike. Alfonso grows increasingly impatient. The political situation in Italy grows ever more complex as alliances shift during the long wait.\n94-97\nSurvives Into 1438. Giovanna becomes a marvel of the age—an ancient queen who will not die. Some whisper of witchcraft; others say God preserves her to punish the ambitious men who circle her throne. The succession question hangs over Italian politics like a storm that never breaks.\n98-100\nSurvives Beyond 1438. Against all reason, Giovanna lives on. She may last until 1439 or even 1440, an impossibly old woman ruling an increasingly chaotic kingdom. When death finally claims her, a generation of princes will have spent their best years waiting. The world will have changed utterly before Alfonso finally sits on his promised throne.\n\nReady to roll when you are, Your Majesty.",
