The sounds of the city drift through the window - distant conversations, the bells marking the hour, the occasional horse passing in the street below.\n\nThe monk waits, his expression open and attentive. Despite the tension in your earlier conversation about certainty and pride, he remains your confessor and spiritual guide. His hands are folded in the sleeves of his habit, his posture patient.\n\nThe crusade banner rests carefully in the corner, the white silk seeming to glow faintly in the lamplight. The reliquaries have been returned to their secure case, guarded by Rodrigo and García outside your door.\n\nTomorrow you depart for Pisa, then Barcelona, then home to Seville. But tonight, there is this moment to give instruction.\n\nFray Hernando inclines his head slightly, ready to listen to whatever task you would set him.\n\nWhat do you tell him?",

I want to send them all to you for confession, not only to keep their souls pure, but also so I can judge their character. I really meant what I said about christian virtues in my speech in Florance and I want my followers to adhere to it. \nAre you able to tell me what I need to know about someone's soul without breaking the spirit by which the confession is performed?",

But also acknowledge there might be limited, careful ways to provide guidance without violating the seal\n4. He would be troubled by this request and need to think through the implications\n\nThis is another moment where Juan is mixing piety with politics in ways that trouble his confessor. It's consistent with their earlier conversation about Juan using sacred things as tools of kingship.\n\nLet me have Hernando respond thoughtfully but with clear concerns.\n\nFray Hernando's expression grows troubled. He takes a slow breath, choosing his words carefully.\n\n\"Your Majesty, I understand what you're asking. And I can see the wisdom in wanting men of virtue to serve you, especially for such a holy cause.\" He pauses, his brow furrowing. \"But you're asking me to walk a very narrow path - perhaps one that doesn't exist.\"\n\nHe moves to sit, gesturing for you to do the same if you wish. When he speaks again, his voice is gentle but firm.\n\n\"The seal of confession is absolute. Not 'mostly absolute' or 'absolute except when it serves a good purpose.' Completely inviolable. I cannot tell you what any man confesses - not their sins, not their doubts, not their intentions. If a man confessed to me that he planned to murder you tomorrow, I could not warn you. I could only refuse him absolution unless he abandoned that plan, and even then, I could not tell you why I refused him.\"\n\nHe meets your eyes directly.\n\n\"But here is what troubles me more, Your Majesty. If your men know that their confession to me might somehow inform your judgment of them - even indirectly - then confession becomes a performance. They will confess what they think sounds virtuous rather than what truly burdens their souls. The sacrament becomes corrupted into a test they must pass.\"\n\nHe folds his hands.\n\n\"I can perhaps tell you this much without violating any seal: I can tell you if a man refuses to confess, or if he approaches the sacrament with obvious dishonesty or mockery. I can observe a man's general character in our conversations outside confession. But I cannot be your judge of souls while also being their confessor. Those two roles poison each other.\"\n\nHe looks at you with both firmness and compassion.\n\n\"Would you have me be your confessor, Your Majesty? Or your intelligence gatherer? Because I don't believe I can be both without failing at one or corrupting the other.\"\n\nWhat is your response?",

I am looking for a way to integrate a good spiritual accountability into the crusade and this just seemed like a good way to do it.\n\n\nBut I understand what you mean about people confessing only what seems the right thing to say instead of truly what burdens their soul.\n\n\nAre you ready to perform confession for my crusade?

      "text": "But Hernando would still want to distinguish between:\n1. Being asked by a cardinal about the king's spiritual fitness (rare, extraordinary circumstance)\n2. Becoming a regular spiritual evaluator for hundreds of crusaders\n\nHe might find a middle ground here. Maybe he can serve as confessor to the crusade, and can speak in general terms about the spiritual health of the army as a whole, or can identify when someone is clearly unsuited (refuses confession, mocks sacraments), but won't be a regular evaluator of individuals.\n\nJuan's question \"How can we steel ourselves against sin?\" is also important and should be addressed seriously.\n\nFray Hernando's expression shifts - a slight widening of the eyes, a small nod of acknowledgment. You've caught him fairly.\n\n\"You're right,\" he says, a hint of rueful admiration in his voice. \"I did speak to Cardinal Orsini about your spiritual state. General observations - that you were genuinely seeking, genuinely uncertain, wrestling with real questions of discernment. I didn't reveal specific confessions, but I did assess your spiritual condition.\"\n\nHe considers for a moment, then continues more thoughtfully.\n\n\"Perhaps there is a path here. I can serve as confessor to your crusaders - I should, in fact. An army marching to war needs spiritual care more than most. And I can make general observations when asked. If a man refuses confession entirely, or approaches it with obvious mockery, or shows clear spiritual unfitness for such a holy cause - these things I could note.\"\n\nHe raises a finger in emphasis.\n\n\"But I cannot become a regular evaluator of souls, giving you reports on each man. That would corrupt the sacrament. Instead, I can be what a chaplain should be: I can help you build a spiritually healthy army through preaching, through encouraging regular confession and communion, through setting an example. And if I encounter someone truly dangerous or unfit, I can find ways to make that known without breaking the seal.\"\n\nHe shifts to your second question, his tone becoming more earnest.\n\n\"As for steeling ourselves against sin - that is the question, isn't it? An army on campaign faces particular temptations. Pillage, rape, cruelty to prisoners, drunkenness, gambling, blasphemy. These things happen in every army, even crusading ones. The question is whether we let them fester or fight them.\"\n\nHe leans forward slightly.\n\n\"We need structure. Regular confession and communion - not just before battle, but weekly if possible. Clear rules about treatment of prisoners and civilians, enforced strictly. Chaplains distributed through the army, not just one priest for thousands of men. And you, Your Majesty, must set the example. If the king treats the sacraments seriously, if he punishes atrocities, if he holds his men to the standards you proclaimed in Florence - then the army might follow.\"\n\nHe pauses, then adds more quietly:\n\n\"And we must acknowledge that even with all this, there will be sin. War is sin's breeding ground. The question is whether we pretend otherwise, or whether we confront it honestly and do penance for what we've done. Your white garments bearing the stains of service - that's closer to the truth than pretending crusaders stay pure.\"\n\nHe looks at you directly.\n\n\"So yes, I'm ready to serve as confessor to your crusade. I'll help you build something better than most armies. But I cannot promise perfection, and I cannot be your spy in the confessional. Is that acceptable?\"\n\nWhat do you say?",

Asking for acceptance, not commanding\n\nFray Hernando should respond positively to this. Juan has listened to his concerns and reframed the request into something that honors the confessor's integrity while giving him a crucial role. This is exactly the kind of spiritual leadership the crusade needs.\n\nFray Hernando would be moved by this - it's a weighty responsibility but one that aligns with his calling. He should accept, probably with some emotion, and perhaps ask practical questions or express the weight of the responsibility.\n\nFray Hernando is silent for a long moment. You see him swallow, his eyes glistening slightly in the lamplight. When he speaks, his voice is thick with emotion.\n\n\"Your Majesty... Juan...\" He seems to struggle for words. \"Yes. Yes, I accept this task.\"\n\nHe stands, then unexpectedly drops to one knee before you - not in submission, but in the gesture of accepting a sacred charge.\n\n\"To build a spiritual culture within an army - to make confession and communion as natural to your crusaders as drilling with weapons - to ensure that when men march to war in God's name, they truly serve God and not just their own ambitions...\" He looks up at you. \"This is work worth doing. This is work worth a lifetime.\"\n\nHe rises, wiping his eyes unselfconsciously.\n\n\"I will need to think carefully about how to do this well. We'll need more than just priests - we'll need the right kind of priests. Men who can live with soldiers, who won't flinch at rough language or hard conditions, but who also won't compromise on the sacraments. Dominicans, perhaps - they're used to preaching. Some Franciscans for their humility and connection to common people. Maybe a few Hieronymites like myself.\"\n\nHis mind is clearly already working through the practicalities.\n\n\"And we'll need your support, Your Majesty. Not just your blessing, but your example. If the men see you confess regularly, if they see you treat the chaplains with respect, if they see you enforce standards of conduct...\" He trails off, then continues more quietly. \"The crusade's spiritual health will depend greatly on what you model.\"\n\nHe meets your eyes with a mixture of determination and trepidation.\n\n\"This is a great task. Perhaps greater than I am. But with God's help, and yours, we'll build something worthy of the white banner you raised today.\"\n\nHe pauses, then adds with a small, wry smile:\n\n\"Though I suspect keeping an army's soul clean will prove harder than keeping that white silk from getting stained.\"\n\nIs there anything else you wish to discuss with him before you retire for the night?",

For listening even when I trouble you with warnings about pride and certainty.\" He wipes his face with his sleeve, unselfconscious. \"And for reminding me why I became a priest in the first place - not to hide in a monastery, but to serve God's people where the need is greatest.\"\n\nHe makes the sign of the cross over you.\n\n\"May God grant you rest tonight, and strength for the journey ahead.

      "text": "Factors favoring success:\n- The party has proven competent over 4 months of travel\n- They have good organization and experienced guards\n- The route Pisa to Barcelona is well-traveled by merchants\n- They have substantial funds to afford good passage\n- Summer/early autumn sailing conditions (August-September) are generally favorable in the Mediterranean\n- Captain Fernán is competent at organizing security\n- The party has functioned smoothly so far\n\nFactors creating risk:\n- Carrying extremely valuable cargo (relics worth immeasurable spiritual value, plus growing treasury)\n- Pirates operate in the Mediterranean, especially Barbary corsairs\n- Political tensions - Alfonso V of Aragon might have agents watching\n- The Infantes' spies saw everything in Florence and might try to intercept\n- Sea travel always carries risks (storms, accidents, etc.)\n- Barcelona is Alfonso V's city - they'll be watched closely once they arrive\n- Granada's agents might also be tracking Juan's movements\n\nHowever, the actual travel portion (Pisa to Barcelona by ship):\n- Is a well-established merchant route\n- In summer/early autumn has good sailing weather\n- With proper precautions and a good ship, should be relatively safe\n- The party is small and can hire a good vessel\n- They have funds to pay for quality passage and security\n\nI think this is \"Likely to succeed\" - there are real risks, but with proper preparation and their demonstrated competence, they should make it. It's not \"High probability\" because sea travel always has uncertainties and they're carrying valuable cargo that enemies would love to intercept. But it's not as difficult as many other things they've attempted.\n\nThe player specifically mentions organizing security for the banner, relics, and treasury, which shows good planning. That increases chances of success.\n\nYou gather your party in the courtyard of the palazzo on the morning of August 10th. The white banner has been carefully rolled and stored in a specially crafted wooden case - long, reinforced with iron bands, and designed to protect the precious silk during travel. The reliquaries remain in their locked chest.\n\nCaptain Fernán listens carefully as you outline the security arrangements, then nods approvingly.\n\n\"Good thinking, Your Majesty. For the treasury, I'll assign Martín - he's steady and won't be distracted. The banner and relics will remain with García, Rodrigo, Felipe and myself in rotating watches. Two men on, two men resting, at all times.\"\n\nHe pauses, then continues:\n\n\"The route to Pisa is just two days - we made excellent time from Rome, we can do it again. From Pisa, we'll need to hire a ship. It's about 400 miles to Barcelona by sea, probably 4-5 days with good winds. The Mediterranean in late summer is generally calm, and the route is well-traveled by merchants.\"\n\nSir Thomas adds his perspective: \"I've sailed these waters before. The main risks are pirates - North African corsairs sometimes operate near the Balearic Islands - and storms, though those are rare this time of year. If we hire a good Genoese or Pisan galley with an experienced captain, and we don't advertise what we're carrying, we should be fine.\"\n\nDiego, your secretary, nervously mentions: \"Your Majesty, Barcelona is King Alfonso's city. We'll be watched from the moment we dock. And after Florence... everyone knows you're traveling with something important now.\"\n\nFray Hernando simply says: \"I will pray for safe passage.\"\n\nProbability Assessment:\n\nGiven the factors at play - your party's demonstrated competence, good sailing season, well-traveled route, proper security measures, and adequate funding for quality passage - I assess this journey as Likely to succeed.\n\nHowever, there are real risks: Mediterranean piracy, the political situation (Alfonso V's agents, the Infantes' spies, possibly Granada's intelligence), the value of your cargo, and the inherent uncertainties of sea travel. A great success might mean arriving ahead of schedule with new opportunities. A failure could mean delays, incidents with authorities, or unwanted attention. A catastrophic failure could involve losing cargo, serious injury, or capture.\n\nPlease roll your dice and tell me the result: Great Success, Success, Failure, or Catastrophic Failure.",

      "text": "The Journey to Barcelona - August 10-19, 1430\n\nFlorence to Pisa (August 10-12)\n\nThe ride west from Florence proves uneventful but purposeful. Your party moves with the practiced efficiency of four months on the road together. The banner case is strapped securely to a pack horse, with García and Rodrigo flanking it constantly. Martín rides beside Diego, who carries the treasury documentation and letters of credit in a locked satchel.\n\nThe Tuscan countryside in late summer is beautiful - golden wheat fields already harvested, vineyards heavy with grapes, cypress trees lining the roads. You pass merchant caravans heading to Florence, and more than once you see travelers stop and stare when they recognize the white tabard you now wear. Word of your speech has spread quickly.\n\nOn the evening of August 11th, you camp near a monastery outside Pisa. The monks have already heard rumors of \"the King of Castile who raised God's banner in Florence.\" The prior offers you lodging, but Captain Fernán politely insists your party camp outside - he doesn't want the relics or treasury within walls where he can't control access.\n\nYou reach Pisa midday on August 12th.\n\nHiring Passage in Pisa (August 12-13)\n\nPisa's harbor bustles with activity - merchant galleys loading spices and silks, fishing boats unloading their catch, shipwrights working on repairs. The smell of salt water, fish, and tar fills the air.\n\nCaptain Fernán and Sir Thomas spend the afternoon surveying available ships while you lodge at a merchant's house arranged by Cosimo de' Medici's contacts. By evening, they return with a recommendation.\n\n\"The Sant'Angelo,\" Captain Fernán reports. \"Thirty-oar galley, Pisan-owned, captain named Luca Grimaldi. He's sailed to Barcelona dozens of times, knows the route, knows the pirates' usual hunting grounds. His crew looks disciplined. The ship is well-maintained.\"\n\n\"He wants 2,000 florins for the passage,\" Sir Thomas adds. \"That's high, but he's seen the banner case and the chest. He knows what we're carrying is valuable, and he's pricing in the risk of attracting attention.\"\n\nYou negotiate briefly with Captain Grimaldi yourself the next morning. He's a lean, weathered man of about fifty with calculating eyes. When you agree to his price, he nods with satisfaction.\n\n\"We depart with tomorrow's tide, Your Majesty. Four days to Barcelona if the winds favor us, five if they don't. My crew knows to keep their mouths shut about passengers' business. You'll have the aft cabin - it's cramped, but private.\"\n\nThe Sea Voyage (August 14-18)\n\nThe Sant'Angelo catches the morning tide on August 14th. The galley rows out of harbor, then raises its lateen sail as the wind picks up. The Mediterranean stretches blue and vast before you.\n\nDay One goes smoothly. Most of your party suffers mild seasickness (including yourself, though you try not to show it). Fray Hernando spends much of the day on deck, face pale but stoically praying. García and Rodrigo maintain their watch over the banner and relics despite obvious queasiness.\n\nBy evening, everyone has found their sea legs somewhat. Captain Grimaldi serves a simple but decent meal - salt fish, hard bread, wine. He mentions casually that two ships have altered course to shadow you at a distance.\n\n\"Probably just merchant vessels curious about who hired my fastest galley,\" he says. \"Or maybe someone's keeping an eye on you, Your Majesty. Either way, they're not close enough to matter.\"\n\nDay Two and Three pass with steady progress. The wind holds from the north, pushing you southwest toward the Balearic Islands. You spend time on deck, watching the coast of southern France slide by in the distance. Sir Thomas points out landmarks he recognizes from previous voyages.\n\nOn the third day, Captain Grimaldi subtly changes course, taking you farther from the Balearic Islands than the direct route would require. When Captain Fernán asks why, Grimaldi explains quietly: \"There's been corsair activity near Mallorca this summer. North African galleys. They'd love to catch a prize like what you're carrying. This route adds half a day but keeps us in safer waters.\"\n\nDay Four brings the only real tension of the voyage. Around midday, a sleek galley appears on the horizon, closing rapidly. It flies no flag you recognize - a plain dark sail, oars beating water at impressive speed.\n\nCaptain Grimaldi orders his crew to battle stations without apparent panic. His men move quickly, efficiently. Weapons appear on deck - crossbows, spears, a few swords.\n\n\"Probably nothing,\" Grimaldi says, though his hand rests on his dagger. \"But we prepare anyway.\"\n\nYour guards form up around the banner case and treasury chest. Captain Fernán has his sword half-drawn. García and Rodrigo look grim but ready.\n\nFor a tense half-hour, the strange galley closes to within a mile. You can see men on its deck, armed and watching. Then, as if reaching some decision, it alters course and breaks away, heading south toward the Balearic Islands at speed.\n\n\"Just curious,\" Grimaldi says, though he doesn't sound entirely convinced. \"Or they decided we looked too well-armed for easy prey. Either way, they're gone.\"\n\nThe rest of the day passes without incident, though everyone remains alert.\n\nDay Five (August 18th) brings Barcelona into view. The city rises from the coast - church spires, the cathedral's incomplete towers, the royal palace on Montjuïc hill, merchant houses crowding the harbor. The enormous Drassanes shipyards sprawl along the waterfront.\n\nAs the Sant'Angelo approaches the harbor, you see something noteworthy: a royal standard flying from the harbor fortress. Not Alfonso V's personal banner (he's still in Naples), but the official standard of the Crown of Aragon.\n\nCaptain Grimaldi points it out. \"They know you're coming, Your Majesty. That's a formal greeting - or a formal watch. Possibly both.\"\n\nArrival in Barcelona (August 18, Late Afternoon)\n\nThe Sant'Angelo docks at one of Barcelona's main piers. A small delegation waits on the quay - six men in the livery of the Crown of Aragon, led by a gray-haired official in fine but sober clothing.\n\nAs your party disembarks - carefully, with García and Rodrigo carrying the banner case and chest under heavy guard - the official steps forward and bows.\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" he says in careful Castilian. \"I am Pere de Cardona, Royal Chamberlain of Barcelona. I welcome you to Barcelona on behalf of King Alfonso V of Aragon, Naples, and Sicily. His Majesty has been informed of your journey and wishes you to know that you are a guest of honor in his realm.\"\n\nHis tone is formally correct but his eyes assess everything - your party's size, the obvious security around the banner case and chest, your white garments.\n\n\"Lodgings have been prepared at the Palau Reial Menor, if you would accept the hospitality of the Crown. Or if you prefer, arrangements can be made elsewhere in the city.\"\n\nBehind him, you can see harbor activity continuing, but you notice people watching from various points around the docks. Some are probably just curious onlookers. Others may be reporting your arrival to various interested parties - Alfonso's court officials, the Infantes' agents, Granada's spies, merchant houses, church officials.\n\nBarcelona knows you've arrived with something important.\n\nYou have successfully reached Barcelona with all your cargo secure, your party intact, and reasonable time made (9 days total from Florence, including the day in Pisa). The banner, relics, and treasury are safe. However, you are now very much under observation in Alfonso V's own city.\n\nWhat do you do?",

He's suggesting meeting her while transporting his possessions to lodgings. This is reasonable - he's being cautious about his sacred cargo while also eager to see family.\n\nPere de Cardona would likely accommodate this. It's a bit unusual but not unreasonable. The question is whether María would receive him in such informal circumstances, or whether protocol requires a more formal audience.\n\nI should probably have Pere de Cardona explain the logistics - they'd need to get word to María first, and she'd need to prepare. It might be more practical to secure the cargo first, THEN see her. Or perhaps she could come to where he's lodging at the Palau Reial Menor?\n\nLet me think about what's most realistic and what creates good story opportunities.\n\nPere de Cardona follows your glance to the banner case and nods with understanding. His expression suggests this level of caution is both expected and respected.\n\n\"Of course, Your Majesty. Your... cargo is clearly precious.\" He doesn't ask what it is, though curiosity flickers in his eyes. \"The Palau Reial Menor where your lodgings are prepared is quite close to the Palau Reial Major where Her Majesty resides. Perhaps a quarter-mile, no more.\"\n\nHe considers for a moment, then offers: \"If you wish, we can send a runner ahead immediately to inform Her Majesty of your arrival. By the time your party reaches the Palau Reial Menor and you've secured your possessions in your chambers, Her Majesty could come to you there. It would be... less formal than a throne room audience, but given you are brother and sister, I suspect she would welcome the intimacy.\"\n\nHe gestures to one of his attendants, who stands ready to run with a message.\n\n\"Or,\" he continues, \"if you prefer even greater haste, I could escort you directly to Her Majesty now. We would need to bring your entire party and cargo into the royal palace complex, which is... unusual, but not impossible given the circumstances. Her Majesty's guards would need to be informed, of course.\"\n\nCaptain Fernán murmurs quietly: \"The first option gives us time to secure everything properly before the meeting. The second gets you to your sister faster but means moving through the palace with all our cargo in tow - more eyes watching, more people curious.\"\n\nPere de Cardona waits patiently for your decision, while the Barcelona dockside continues its subtle observation of your arrival.\n\nHow do you wish to proceed?",

Hateful/Hostile - She blames Juan (or Castile) for something serious\n2. Cold/Resentful - She feels abandoned or used by Castile/her family\n3. Distant/Cautious - She's politically careful, doesn't trust easily\n4. Cordial/Diplomatic - Professional family relations, neither warm nor cold\n5. Warm/Affectionate - She still feels sisterly bonds despite years apart\n6. Joyful/Enthusiastic - She's delighted to see her little brother and eager to help\n\nLet me flesh out reasons for each:\n\nPere de Cardona nods and immediately dispatches a young attendant who sprints off toward the royal palace at impressive speed.\n\n\"Her Majesty will be informed within minutes, Your Majesty. Now, if you'll follow me, we'll get you and your company settled.\"\n\nAs your party begins the walk through Barcelona's streets toward the palace - García and Rodrigo carrying the banner case, Martín guarding the treasury chest, the rest of your guards forming a protective cordon - I need to establish Queen María's disposition toward you.\n\nQueen María of Aragon's Disposition Scale\n\nRoll 1d6 and tell me the result. Here are the possibilities:\n\n1 - Hostile/Bitter: María deeply resents being used as a political pawn in the Castilian-Aragonese alliance. Fifteen years of marriage with no children, a husband who abandoned her for Italian adventures, caught between her birth family and adopted kingdom. She blames Castilian politics (and by extension, you and your advisors) for her unhappy position. She may see your visit as another manipulation.\n\n2 - Cold/Resentful: She feels abandoned by her Castilian family. You were only three when she married and left; you've barely corresponded over the years. She's heard the Infantes' version of events and is inclined to believe you're an unstable young king dominated by a low-born favorite. She'll receive you out of duty, but with little warmth.\n\n3 - Cautious/Guarded: María has learned to be politically careful after fifteen years as queen without her husband's presence. She's uncertain where you stand, what you want, and how your visit affects her delicate position managing Aragon in Alfonso's absence. She'll be correct but reserved until she understands your intentions.\n\n4 - Cordially Diplomatic: She maintains proper family relations and is genuinely curious about you (her little brother, now a king making waves across Christendom). She's heard conflicting reports about your actions and wants to form her own judgment. Professional warmth with potential for more.\n\n5 - Warm/Affectionate: Despite years apart, María remembers you as her baby brother. She's heard about your pilgrimage, your audience with the Pope, and sees echoes of genuine faith that moves her. She's lonely in Barcelona with Alfonso gone and welcomes family connection. She may offer real help.\n\n6 - Joyful/Protective: María is delighted and relieved to see you. She's been worried about reports of the Infantes maneuvering against you, sees you as the little brother who needs her guidance, and is thrilled you've come to her. She's eager to help, give advice, and reconnect. She may have information and resources to offer.\n\nPlease roll 1d6 and tell me the result.",

Securing the banner, relics, and treasury\n4. The wait for María\n5. Her arrival\n\nThis should be atmospheric and build anticipation for their reunion. María hasn't seen Juan since he was very young (he's 18 now, she left when he was about 3 years old - married around 1415). She would be about 33 years old now.\n\nI should make this a meaningful family moment while also acknowledging the political context.\n\nPere de Cardona leads your party through Barcelona's streets. The city is impressive - narrow medieval lanes opening into broader plazas, merchant houses with elaborate facades, the distinctive Catalan Gothic architecture everywhere. People stop to watch your procession pass, whispering and pointing at your white garments and the heavily guarded cases your men carry.\n\nThe Palau Reial Menor sits adjacent to the great cathedral, a handsome stone building with arched windows and a small courtyard. Palace guards snap to attention as you arrive, and servants quickly appear to assist with your lodging.\n\nYour chambers are on the second floor - a suite of three rooms that are comfortable if not palatial. Captain Fernán immediately takes charge of security, positioning García and Rodrigo in the main room with the banner case and reliquary chest. Martín stands watch over the treasury documents. The other guards check windows and doors.\n\n\"We're as secure as we can be, Your Majesty,\" Captain Fernán reports. \"No one enters these rooms without going through your guards first.\"\n\nYou have perhaps twenty minutes to settle in, wash the salt from your face and hands, before there's a commotion in the corridor outside. Not hostile - excited. A woman's voice, speaking rapid Catalan to the guards, then switching to Castilian: \"Let me through - he's my brother!\"\n\nThe door opens, and Queen María of Aragon enters.\n\nShe's thirty-three now, though she looks younger - dark hair pulled back under a modest veil, warm brown eyes very like your own, a face that shows both Spanish and Trastámara heritage. She wears a fine but relatively simple gown in deep blue, as if she hadn't bothered to change into full court dress.\n\nFor a moment she just stares at you from the doorway. Her hand goes to her mouth.\n\n\"Dios mío,\" she whispers. \"You look so much like father. The same eyes, the same...\" She trails off, and then suddenly she's crossing the room quickly, propriety forgotten.\n\nShe embraces you tightly - and you realize she's trembling slightly.\n\n\"Juan. My little brother. You were barely three years old when I left for Barcelona. I've seen you perhaps twice since then - always formal audiences, always surrounded by courtiers and advisors. And now you're here, and you're...\" She steps back, still holding your shoulders, looking at you with glistening eyes. \"You're a man. A king. Wearing white like a knight from the old romances.\"\n\nShe glances around the room, taking in your companions, the guarded cases, then back to you.\n\n\"I've heard such stories. Your pilgrimage. Rome. Something extraordinary with Pope Martin. The speech in Florence that has all of Italy talking. Half of Christendom says you're blessed by God. The other half...\" She pauses delicately. \"Well. Alfonso's brothers have been writing letters saying other things.\"\n\nShe searches your face, then says more quietly:\n\n\"Tell me, hermano. Tell me what's really happening. Because I want to believe the good stories, but I need to hear it from you.\"\n\nWhat do you say to your sister?",

She's been isolated in Barcelona, lonely with Alfonso gone, and genuinely wants to connect with her brother. She'll be curious, supportive, but also concerned - she's heard conflicting reports and wants to understand what's really happening.\n\nI should have her respond with warmth but also with the practical concern of someone who's been navigating difficult political waters for fifteen years. She'll want to know more, she'll be excited but also worried for him. She might also have useful information or perspective to share about Alfonso, the Infantes, the political situation.\n\nThis is a family moment but also a politically significant one - she's Queen of Aragon, even if her husband is absent and she has no children to secure her position.\n\nMaría's expression softens even further at your words, though concern flickers in her eyes. She guides you to sit, gesturing for wine to be brought. Once the servants have poured and withdrawn, she sits close beside you - not in a throne room, but like family.\n\n\"Changed a lot,\" she repeats softly, studying your face. \"Yes, I can see that. There's something in your eyes - a weight that wasn't there before. Or perhaps I simply never saw you long enough to notice.\"\n\nShe takes your hand in both of hers.\n\n\"The Reconquista. A crusade bull from Pope Martin himself.\" She shakes her head in wonder. \"Juan, do you understand how extraordinary that is? How dangerous? You're eighteen years old, and you're taking on something that's defeated kings for centuries.\"\n\nBut there's no criticism in her tone - only concern mixed with something like pride.\n\n\"Tell me more. How did this happen? When I heard you'd gone on pilgrimage, I thought...\" She pauses, choosing words carefully. \"Juan and Enrique wrote that you'd abandoned the realm for mystical wanderings, that Álvaro de Luna was ruling in your name while you chased visions. But then word came from Rome - something about an audience with the Pope, something remarkable. And now you appear in Barcelona carrying...\"\n\nShe glances at the guarded cases. \"What are you carrying, hermano? Why such careful protection?\"\n\nShe leans closer, her voice dropping.\n\n\"And more importantly - are you safe? Juan de Aragón is my husband's brother, and I know him well enough to know he doesn't accept challenges to his authority gracefully. Whatever happened between you and him, it's made enemies. I need to know if you're in danger.\"\n\nThere's genuine worry in her voice now.\n\n\"Tell me everything. Please. I've been so isolated here - Alfonso in Naples chasing his Italian dreams, no children to give me real purpose, caught between my birth family and the family I married into. You're the first real connection to home I've had in years.\"\n\nHow much do you tell her? What do you want to know from her?",

This is interesting because it's consistent with how he's presented himself publicly, but it's also a form of deception to his sister.\n\nI should have María respond warmly to the story, showing she's moved by it, but also perhaps probe a bit - she's been in court politics for 15 years, she might sense there's more calculation than Juan is admitting, or she might just accept the narrative at face value because she wants to believe in her brother.\n\nLet me narrate her reactions as he tells the story, showing her emotional responses, and then have her respond with questions, concerns, and perhaps offers of help.\n\nYou tell her everything. The pilgrimage to Santiago, how you felt moved to return for your father's sword, arriving at the palace just in time to hear the Infantes plotting to make the regency permanent. María's eyes widen at this, her hand tightening on yours.\n\n\"They said that? In your own council chamber?\" She looks genuinely shocked.\n\nYou continue - the confrontation, removing Juan de Aragón from the council, the journey through France gathering letters of recommendation. When you describe the audience with Pope Martin V, María leans forward, completely absorbed.\n\nAs you tell her about stripping yourself naked before the Pope, offering everything you had, her free hand goes to her mouth. Tears begin sliding down her cheeks.\n\n\"Dios mío, Juan,\" she whispers. \"You truly did that? Offered everything?\"\n\nYou describe the Pope's reaction, his tears, the blessing, the crusade bull. The fragment of the True Cross and Saint James's bone. The twenty thousand florins. The speech in Florence that raised over sixty thousand more.\n\nWhen you finish, María sits in silence for a long moment, tears still on her face. Then she stands, walks to the window, and stares out over Barcelona for several heartbeats before turning back to you.\n\n\"I believe you,\" she says quietly. \"I believe every word. Because no one could invent something like that - it's too strange, too audacious. And because...\" She returns to sit beside you. \"Because I can see it in you, hermano. Something has changed. You're not the uncertain boy-king the Infantes described in their letters. You're something else now.\"\n\nShe wipes her eyes, then her expression grows more serious.\n\n\"But Juan, you must understand what you're walking into. The Infantes - both of them, and Alfonso too - they don't see what I see. They see a threat. A young king who's bypassed their authority, who's received papal blessing they didn't approve, who's raising armies and funds outside their control.\"\n\nShe leans closer, her voice urgent.\n\n\"Juan de Aragón - my husband's brother, the one you removed from your council - he's been in Barcelona. Just last month. He met with Alfonso's advisors here, wrote letters to Naples. He's building his case that you're unstable, unreliable, that Castile needs 'experienced governance.' And now you appear here, in Alfonso's own city, carrying papal relics and crusade funds...\"\n\nShe pauses, searching your face.\n\n\"What do you need from me, Juan? Why did you come to Barcelona? Just to pass through on your way to Seville? Or did you hope to...\" She gestures around. \"To make a statement? To show Alfonso that you have the Pope's backing and won't be intimidated?\"\n\nHer tone isn't critical - she's trying to understand your strategy.\n\n\"Because if you're here to make a statement, I can help with that. I manage Alfonso's court in his absence. I can arrange for you to speak before the Catalan nobility, to display your relics in the cathedral, to make it clear that Rome has blessed your cause. But if you do that, you're declaring openly that you don't fear the Infantes or Alfonso's displeasure. It will force him to take a position - support you or support his brothers.\"\n\nShe takes both your hands again.\n\n\"So tell me, hermano - what do you need? And how can I help you?\"\n\nWhat do you say? What do you want from your time in Barcelona?",

      "text": "In reality, Alfonso V was indeed focused on his Italian ambitions and spent much time away from Aragon. When he was absent, governance typically fell to:\n1. A Lieutenant General (often his wife or brother)\n2. The Corts (Cortes) - the Aragonese/Catalan parliament which was quite powerful\n3. Various royal councils and officials\n4. The Diputació del General (Generalitat) in Catalonia\n\nMaría of Castile (Juan's sister) was Alfonso's wife, but historically they had no children and the marriage was somewhat distant. Alfonso would later have his brother Juan (one of the Infantes) serve as Lieutenant, but in 1430 that arrangement might not be fully established yet.\n\nGiven the story context:\n- Alfonso is in Naples pursuing his Italian ambitions\n- The Infantes (Juan and Enrique) have been causing trouble in Castile\n- María seems somewhat isolated and without real power (\"no children to give me real purpose\")\n\nI should present a realistic picture where María has some ceremonial/social authority as queen, but real governing power is distributed among:\n1. A regency council or Lieutenant General\n2. The Aragonese nobility and Corts\n3. Royal officials\n4. Possibly one of the Infantes has some formal role\n\nThis is important because it will determine how much María can actually help Juan, and who else he needs to deal with in Barcelona.\n\nMaría's expression shifts slightly - a flicker of something that might be resignation or perhaps bitterness, quickly masked.\n\n\"Ah. You ask the real question.\" She stands and paces to the window again, her back to you for a moment.\n\n\"I manage the court,\" she says carefully. \"I receive ambassadors, I host ceremonies, I represent the crown at religious festivals. I am the visible face of royal authority in Barcelona.\" She turns back to face you. \"But I do not rule, hermano.\"\n\nShe returns to sit, her voice matter-of-fact now, as if stating facts she's long since accepted.\n\n\"Alfonso appointed a council before he left for Naples - the Consell Reial. It's led by the Archbishop of Zaragoza and includes several major nobles. They handle day-to-day governance, judicial matters, military decisions. They consult me on certain matters, particularly those involving other kingdoms or the Church. But they don't require my approval.\"\n\nShe pauses, then adds more quietly:\n\n\"And then there's the Corts - the Aragonese parliament. The nobility, the Church, the cities. They guard their privileges jealously and Alfonso must negotiate with them for any significant funds or laws. They meet irregularly, but they're the real power here. Far more than I am.\"\n\nA slight smile, tinged with irony.\n\n\"A queen without children has limited authority, Juan. I can open doors for you, arrange audiences, whisper in the right ears. The Archbishop respects me. Several noble houses owe me favors. The common people love me because I'm visible and generous with charity. But I cannot command armies or commit Aragon to alliances. I cannot override the Consell if they decide something.\"\n\nShe leans forward.\n\n\"However - and this is important - Juan de Aragón has no official authority here either. He's King of Navarre, yes, but that's a separate crown. In Aragon, he's simply the king's brother, nothing more. He can write letters and scheme, but he cannot command the Consell or the Corts.\"\n\nHer expression grows more calculating.\n\n\"What I can do is shape perceptions. If you display your papal relics in the cathedral with my blessing, it carries weight. If I host you at the royal palace, introduce you to the right people, speak of you warmly to the Archbishop and the great houses - that matters. Not because I have formal power, but because I represent continuity, legitimacy, the crown's presence.\"\n\nShe meets your eyes directly.\n\n\"And I can tell you who matters here. Who to speak with, who to avoid, who might be reporting to Juan de Aragón, who might be open to supporting your crusade. That information could be valuable.\"\n\nShe pauses, then asks more softly:\n\n\"Why do you ask, hermano? Are you concerned about how much I can actually help? Or are you trying to understand the political landscape before you make your next move?\"\n\nWhat do you say?",

She's been navigating Aragonese politics for 15 years. She would understand:\n1. The Consell Reial (royal council) - probably needs her introduction but possible\n2. The Corts (parliament) - much more formal, harder to convene, but powerful\n3. The Archbishop and church hierarchy - probably the most accessible and influential\n4. Individual noble houses - can be approached separately\n5. Public displays (cathedral, etc.) - easier to arrange and impactful\n\nShe'd also know:\n- Alfonso's letter from the Pope exists but hasn't arrived yet, or has arrived but Alfonso hasn't responded\n- The Consell would be cautious about committing to anything without Alfonso's explicit approval\n- The Corts would need to be formally convened - can't just be called\n- But there are other ways to build support and make statements\n\nShe'd probably advise a multi-pronged approach that doesn't require official governmental approval but builds momentum and makes it harder for the Infantes to oppose him.\n\nMaría's expression softens completely at your words. She reaches out and cups your face with one hand, her eyes wet again.\n\n\"Thank you for saying that, hermano. You don't know how much I needed to hear it. Fifteen years here, and sometimes I feel more like a diplomatic artifact than a person - displayed when useful, stored away when not.\" She wipes her eyes quickly. \"But yes. Sister first. Always.\"\n\nShe takes a deep breath, visibly shifting into more practical mode while still maintaining that warmth.\n\n\"Now, to your questions. The Pope has written to Alfonso?\" She considers. \"That letter may not have reached Naples yet, or Alfonso may be deliberately slow in responding - his Italian campaign consumes him entirely. But the fact that it exists is powerful.\"\n\nShe stands and begins pacing, thinking aloud.\n\n\"The Consell Reial - I could arrange for you to meet with them. The Archbishop of Zaragoza is the key figure, and he's actually in Barcelona right now. He's devout, politically cautious, but he respects papal authority deeply. If you showed him the crusade bull, the relics, told him about Rome...\" She nods to herself. \"Yes, he would listen. And if he supports you, others on the council would follow his lead.\"\n\nShe turns back to you.\n\n\"But the Corts - the parliament - that's more complicated. They meet only when formally convened by the king or in genuine emergency. I cannot summon them, and they wouldn't appreciate being called for what they might see as Castilian business. However...\" Her eyes light up. \"Individual representatives can be approached. The great houses, the city councils, the Church hierarchy. You don't need the Corts as an institution if you can win over its key members individually.\"\n\nShe sits back down beside you, speaking more urgently now.\n\n\"Here's what I think you should do. A multi-part approach over the next week or two:\n\nFirst, display the relics publicly in Barcelona Cathedral. I can arrange this easily - the Bishop is a friend. Let the people see what you carry. Let them witness the fragment of the True Cross and Saint James's bone. This creates religious fervor and makes your crusade real to them. After Florence, you know how powerful this can be.\n\nSecond, I'll arrange a private dinner with Archbishop of Zaragoza and select members of the Consell. Intimate, not formal. You tell your story, show them the papal bull, answer their concerns. They need to see you're not the unstable mystic the Infantes describe.\n\nThird, audiences with key noble houses. The Counts of Urgell, the Cardona family, perhaps the Montcadas. These are the power brokers in Catalonia. Some will be cautious, but if even a few commit support - funds, troops, political backing - it strengthens your position enormously.\n\nFourth...\" She pauses, choosing words carefully. \"You should write to Alfonso directly. Tell him about Rome, about the Pope's blessing, about the crusade. Be respectful - he is king, he is my husband, and he has the power to either help or hinder you significantly. But be clear that you're proceeding with papal authority whether or not he joins. Show strength, not pleading.\"\n\nShe squeezes your hand.\n\n\"As for Navarre - Infante Juan's kingdom - that's more dangerous. Navarre is small but strategically positioned between Castile and Aragon. If Juan actively opposes you, he could disrupt communications, harbor your enemies, even threaten your border. But if you gain enough support here in Aragon, and if Alfonso at least stays neutral, then Juan becomes isolated. He can write letters and scheme, but he can't wage war alone.\"\n\nShe leans back, studying your face.\n\n\"This would take perhaps two weeks, maybe three. You'd remain in Barcelona as my honored guest. I'd introduce you to the right people, arrange the right meetings, help you navigate Catalan politics.\" She smiles slightly. \"And we'd have time together as brother and sister, not just king and queen. I'd like that.\"\n\nThen her expression grows more serious.\n\n\"But Juan, you must understand - this commits you to staying here longer. Every day you remain in Alfonso's city without his explicit permission is a statement. You're saying you don't need his approval. That could anger him, or it could force him to respect you. I don't know which. And the Infantes will hear of everything you do here. They'll be preparing their response.\"\n\nShe searches your eyes.\n\n\"Is that the kind of statement you want to make?

Correspondence with Castilian nobles or church officials\n4. Merchants and travelers bringing news\n\nShe would likely have a more objective view than the Infantes themselves, but might not know every detail. She'd probably know:\n- That something happened (the Infantes tried to consolidate power)\n- That it didn't go well for them\n- That news from Rome changed everything\n- General outlines but not all specifics\n\nI should have her share what she knows, which would give Juan valuable intelligence about how his kingdom fared in his absence.\n\nMaría's expression grows more guarded. She glances toward the door, then lowers her voice slightly.\n\n\"I've heard things. Through letters, through Alfonso's intelligence network, through merchants and travelers.\" She pauses. \"The Infantes have been... active during your absence.\"\n\nShe stands and moves to a small writing desk, pulling out several letters.\n\n\"Juan de Aragón wrote to me three times over the summer. The letters were carefully worded, but the message was clear - he was attempting to rally Castilian nobles against what he called 'Álvaro de Luna's tyranny' and your 'abandonment of the realm for mystical pursuits.'\" She sets down the letters. \"He tried to make it sound like he was protecting your interests while you were away. But I could read between the lines.\"\n\nShe returns to sit beside you.\n\n\"From what I've pieced together from various sources: In June and July, Juan called an assembly at Burgos. He was hoping for a strong showing of noble support - perhaps thirty or forty major houses. He got twenty-three. Most nobles sent polite refusals or simply didn't respond.\"\n\nShe taps her fingers thoughtfully.\n\n\"Then he tried something more direct. Military action. He seized Arévalo fortress - that much I know for certain because he wrote Alfonso asking for tacit approval after the fact. He also took at least two smaller castles in the north. But...\" She meets your eyes. \"He failed to take any major cities. Segovia refused him entry outright. I heard that from a merchant who was there - the city leaders told Juan's men that 'Segovia serves the king, not princes of Aragon.'\"\n\nA slight smile crosses her face.\n\n\"And then, in mid-August, everything changed. Word reached Castile that you'd been to Rome. That you'd met with Pope Martin. That something extraordinary had happened.\" She leans forward. \"I don't know exactly when the news arrived, but Juan's next letter to me was very different in tone. Defensive. Making excuses. Saying he'd only been trying to maintain order until your return.\"\n\nShe pauses, then adds more quietly:\n\n\"From what I can gather, whatever coalition he was trying to build... it collapsed. Nobles who had been cautiously interested suddenly wanted nothing to do with open opposition to a king who had papal backing. Juan retreated to his estates. Enrique apparently remained on your regency council - I heard that from the Archbishop of Zaragoza, who has contacts in Toledo.\"\n\nShe searches your face.\n\n\"As for Álvaro de Luna - he seems to have held firm. I've heard no reports of him being removed or fleeing or losing control of the administration. The major cities remained loyal. Your advisors - that cabinet you mentioned forming - apparently functioned well.\"\n\nShe squeezes your hand.\n\n\"In short, hermano, your kingdom survived your absence better than the Infantes hoped. They tried to exploit your pilgrimage, but they couldn't build enough support fast enough. And when news of Rome arrived, they lost their momentum entirely.\"\n\nHer expression grows more serious.\n\n\"But that makes them more dangerous, not less. They've been humiliated. They've exposed themselves as rebels without having succeeded. Wounded animals are unpredictable. By the time you reach Seville for your Royal Council in November, they'll have had months to prepare their response.\"\n\nShe tilts her head thoughtfully.\n\n\"There is one other thing. I've heard rumors - just rumors, mind you - that Granada has been... unusually active diplomatically this summer. Merchants report unusual traffic in and out of Granada's ports. Something about embassies sent to Morocco, Egypt, perhaps even the Ottomans.\" She frowns. \"I don't know if that's true, or if it's just the sort of stories that circulate when people hear about a crusade being planned. But it's worth noting.\"\n\nShe looks at you directly.\n\n\"When was the last time you received correspondence from Álvaro? Do you know the current state of your realm beyond what I've just told you?\"\n\nWhat do you tell her? And what else do you want to ask?",

This puts her in an impossible position\n- The Infantes still have supporters and military forces\n- Arresting them might rally nobles who are currently neutral to their defense (attacking royal family members is serious)\n- Juan doesn't know the full current situation - his correspondence may have been intercepted\n- This is being done from Barcelona, Alfonso's city, which could be seen as provocative\n\nI should have María react to this immediately. She would be shocked and concerned - this directly affects her husband's family. She would likely try to counsel caution or at least want to discuss the implications.\n\nAlso, Juan should probably know that ordering arrests from Barcelona while he's still traveling is... complicated. The letter would take time to reach Álvaro, and executing such orders would be extremely difficult and risky.\n\nThis is a moment where the player is about to make a potentially huge mistake or brilliant move. I should let María react realistically as his sister who cares about him AND is married into the Aragonese royal family.\n\nMaría's face goes pale.

Wait.\" Her voice is urgent, almost frightened. \"Think about what you're saying.\"\n\nShe glances at the door, then moves closer, speaking in a fierce whisper.\n\n\"These are my husband's brothers. Alfonso's blood. If you order them arrested for treason, you're not just moving against rebellious nobles - you're moving against the royal family of Aragon. Do you understand what that means?\"\n\nShe's gripping your wrist tightly now, her eyes intense.\n\n\"Yes, they rebelled. Yes, they seized fortresses and tried to rally nobles against you. But they failed. They retreated. They're exposed and weakened. Right now, they're humiliated but not desperate.\" She takes a breath. \"If you try to arrest them - to put them on trial for treason - you give them no choice but total war. You corner them. And you force Alfonso to choose between his brothers and his sister's brother.\"\n\nShe releases your wrist and paces away, then turns back.\n\n\"And hermano - you're sitting in Barcelona. Alfonso's city. Under his roof. If you write from here ordering the arrest of his brothers...\" She shakes her head. \"It looks like you're using his hospitality to strike at his family. It poisons everything. It makes me look complicit. It makes Alfonso look weak for hosting you.\"\n\nHer voice drops even lower.\n\n\"And there's something else you need to know. Something I didn't want to burden you with immediately, but...\" She hesitates, then continues. \"Your correspondence with Álvaro. I've heard whispers - just whispers - from some of Alfonso's advisors that the Infantes may have people in the postal networks between here and Castile. They may be reading your letters. I don't know this for certain, but if it's true, and you write ordering their arrest...\"\n\nShe lets that hang in the air.\n\n\"They would know immediately. They would have time to prepare, to fortify their positions, to rally whatever support they still have. The element of surprise would be lost entirely.\"\n\nShe comes back to sit beside you, taking both your hands in hers, her expression pleading.\n\n\"Juan, I'm not saying you're wrong. They are traitors. They did rebel. But arresting royal princes is not something you do hastily from hundreds of miles away. It requires careful planning, overwhelming force, and absolute certainty of support.\"\n\nShe searches your face.\n\n\"At minimum, shouldn't you wait until you're back in Castile? Until you can coordinate with Álvaro directly, assess the true military situation, ensure you have the forces to actually execute such arrests? And shouldn't you at least wait until after the Royal Council in November - where you can confront them publicly with the papal bull, with all the nobles watching, and force them to submit or openly defy Rome itself?\"\n\nShe squeezes your hands.\n\n\"I know you're angry. I know you want to act. But please - think strategically, not emotionally. Don't give them the opening they need to turn this into a full civil war, and don't put me in an impossible position between my husband's family and my birth family.\"\n\nHer eyes are wet with tears now.\n\n\"Please, hermano. Think about this carefully before you write that letter.\"\n\nWhat do you do?",

María - would be relieved not to be involved but still worried about the consequences\n\nThis is also a major decision point. The player is committing to a confrontational approach with the Infantes rather than using the November council to pressure them. Let me have the characters respond realistically.\n\nCaptain Fernán would ask practical questions about:\n- Timeline (how long to reach Castile?)\n- Security (traveling alone or with guards?)\n- What if he's intercepted?\n- Does this mean the King stays in Barcelona without his most trusted commander?\n\nFray Hernando would have concerns about:\n- Justice vs. vengeance\n- Whether this serves the crusade or creates civil war\n- The timing and wisdom of the action\n\nMaría would be relieved but still worried.\n\nI should have them all react, raise their concerns, and let the player think through the implications.\n\nCaptain Fernán and Fray Hernando arrive within moments. Fernán's hand rests instinctively on his sword hilt as he enters - the urgency in your summons has put him on alert. Fray Hernando's expression is concerned, his eyes moving between you and María's tear-stained face.\n\nYou give your orders. Captain Fernán listens without interruption, his weathered face unreadable. When you finish, there's a moment of heavy silence.\n\nThen the Captain speaks, his voice carefully measured:\n\n\"Your Majesty, I will do as you command. Always.\" He pauses. \"But I need to understand what you're ordering clearly. You want me to ride to Castile - that's at least two weeks of hard travel, possibly three. I'm to deliver orders to Don Álvaro to publicly demand the Infantes surrender themselves for trial on charges of treason and rebellion.\"\n\nHe shifts his weight slightly.\n\n\"Some practical questions, if I may. First, I'll need a written order with your seal - Álvaro won't move on just my word, and he'll need documentation to show the nobility. Second, do I travel alone or with guards? Alone is faster and more discreet, but if the Infantes have agents watching the roads...\" He lets that hang.\n\n\"Third, and most important, Your Majesty - this leaves you here in Barcelona without your most experienced commander. You'll have Sergeant García, Rodrigo, and the others, but they're good men, not officers. You'd be in Alfonso's city, carrying the crusade relics and treasury, while I'm weeks away.\"\n\nFray Hernando steps forward, his expression deeply troubled.\n\n\"Your Majesty, may I speak?\" At your nod, he continues carefully. \"I understand your anger at the Infantes' rebellion. What they did was treasonous. But...\" He glances at María, then back to you. \"Is this justice or is this vengeance? And more practically - is this wise?\"\n\nHe clasps his hands together.\n\n\"You said in Florence that Christian virtue should guide your crusaders. One of those virtues is prudence - acting wisely, not rashly. Another is mercy toward those who might yet repent.\" He pauses. \"The Infantes rebelled and failed. They're humiliated and weakened. In November, you could confront them at the Royal Council with all the nobles watching, with the papal bull in hand, with the weight of Rome behind you. You could force them to bend the knee publicly or be condemned by everyone present.\"\n\nHis voice grows more urgent.\n\n\"But if you order their arrest now, from hundreds of miles away, you turn a failed rebellion into a desperate fight for survival. You give them no choice but total resistance. And you risk splitting Castile into armed camps right when you need unity for the crusade.\"\n\nHe meets your eyes.\n\n\"I'm not saying they don't deserve punishment. I'm asking - is this the right moment? Is this the right method? Or are you acting from wounded pride rather than strategic calculation?\"\n\nMaría has been silent, but now she speaks quietly:\n\n\"I'm grateful you want to keep me out of it, hermano. Truly. But Fray Hernando is right - this could tear everything apart. And...\" She hesitates. \"If Captain Fernán leaves, and something happens to you here while he's gone, I would never forgive myself.\"\n\nAll three of them are watching you, waiting.\n\nWhat do you do?

But they'd do it solemnly, maintaining the gravity.\n\nGarcía and Rodrigo exchange a brief glance. Then García, the older sergeant, straightens and speaks with unexpected formality:\n\n\"Your Majesty has entrusted us with this sacred charge.

Rodrigo produces the key from around his neck, unlocks it, and carefully lifts the lid.\n\nInside, nestled in velvet padding, rest two reliquaries:\n\nThe gold reliquary - perhaps eight inches tall, ornately worked with religious scenes, set with small gems. Through a crystal window in the front, you can see it: a small fragment of dark wood, no longer than a man's thumb, mounted in a cross of gold wire.\n\nThe silver reliquary - slightly smaller, more austere in design but beautifully crafted. Through its crystal face: a single finger bone, yellowed with age, resting on white silk.\n\nMaría's hands fly to her mouth. She takes a step forward, then stops, as if afraid to get too close. Your hands rest on her shoulders, steadying her.\n\n\"Dios mío,\" she whispers. \"That's... that's truly...\"\n\nShe can't finish the sentence.

She stares at the dark fragment of wood through her tears.\n\n\"The True Cross,\" she whispers. \"The cross where Our Lord died for our sins. Juan... you're carrying this?\"\n\nShe looks up at you, then back at the reliquary, then back to you. Her face shows wonder, fear, joy, and something like awe all at once.\n\n\"No wonder...\" she says through her tears. \"No wonder the Pope blessed you. No wonder Florence erupted. If you march with this...\" She shakes her head, unable to articulate it.\n\nGarcía gently lifts the silver reliquary. \"And the blessed Saint James, Your Majesty. Santiago himself, patron of Spain, who brings victory to Christian armies.\"\n\nMaría makes the sign of the cross, her hands trembling. She leans closer to the gold reliquary, close enough that her breath might fog the crystal if she weren't holding it carefully.\n\n\"May I...\" she whispers to the guards, not to you. \"May I pray before it? Just for a moment?\"\n\nRodrigo glances at you for confirmation, then nods. He kneels, holding the reliquary steady at a height where María can see it clearly while she prays.\n\nYour sister closes her eyes, clasps her hands, and begins to pray in Latin. Her voice is barely audible, but you catch fragments: \"...Domine Jesu Christe... qui pro nobis in cruce...\" (Lord Jesus Christ... who for us on the cross...)\n\nShe prays for perhaps two minutes - it feels both very long and very brief. When she finishes, she opens her eyes, looks at the reliquary one more time with something like desperate love, then makes the sign of the cross again and rises shakily to her feet.\n\nShe turns to you, and suddenly embraces you tightly, burying her face in your shoulder. You can feel her shaking.\n\n\"I understand now,\" she says into your shoulder. \"I understand everything. Why you're so certain. Why you feel called. Juan, you're carrying the cross itself. How could you fail with that blessing you?\"\n\nShe pulls back, wiping her face with her hands, not caring about the tears or her appearance.\n\n\"Yes,\" she says firmly. \"Yes, we'll display them in the cathedral. All of Barcelona needs to see this. All of Catalonia. Let them see what you carry. Let them understand that this isn't politics or ambition - this is holy.\"\n\nShe looks back at the reliquaries as García and Rodrigo carefully return them to their velvet nest and close the chest.\n\n\"Thank you,\" she says to the guards. \"For showing me. For guarding them so faithfully.\" Then to you: \"And thank you, hermano. For trusting me with this. For letting me see...\"\n\nShe can't finish. She just embraces you again.\n\nAfter a long moment, she composes herself and steps back.\n\n\"I'll arrange everything. The cathedral display, the meetings with the Archbishop and the Consell. They need to see this. They need to understand.\" She wipes her eyes once more. \"But first... you should write that letter to Álvaro. And I should let you work.\"\n\nShe moves toward the door, then pauses and looks back.\n\n\"God is with you, Juan. I felt it in that room just now. Whatever happens with the Infantes, whatever challenges come - God is with you.\"\n\nShe departs, leaving you with Fray Hernando at the writing desk, ready to draft your letter to Álvaro de Luna.\n\nWhat do you want the letter to say?",

Hernando should write it faithfully but might gently probe whether Juan wants such strong language, especially the comparison to his \"clarity\" before Rome - which could be seen as invoking divine guidance for this political action.\n\nFray Hernando dips the quill in ink and begins writing as you dictate, his hand steady and practiced. He writes in a clear, formal script appropriate for official royal correspondence. The scratching of the quill on parchment is the only sound in the room for several minutes.\n\nWhen he finishes, he carefully blots the ink and reads it back to you word for word to ensure accuracy.

You felt moved by the Spirit to undertake that journey, to offer yourself before the Pope. That was...\" He searches for words. \"That was a spiritual action. A religious pilgrimage that became a sacred offering.\"\n\nHe looks up at you.\n\n\"This letter orders a political arrest. It may trigger civil war. It serves your temporal authority, not primarily the Gospel.\" He holds up a hand. \"I'm not saying it's wrong - the Infantes did rebel, and kings must maintain order. But by comparing your clarity now to your clarity before Rome, you're... suggesting that this political decision carries the same divine sanction as your spiritual journey.\"\n\nHe taps the parchment gently.\n\n\"Are you certain you want to make that comparison? Because if people read this letter - and royal letters often leak or are shared - they'll see you claiming God's guidance for ordering the arrest of princes. That's...\" He struggles. \"That's using the language of divine calling to justify political action. It's exactly what we've discussed: the danger of confusing your will with God's will.\"\n\nHe meets your eyes.\n\n\"I'll seal it exactly as written if you wish. But I wanted to ask: is this how you want to frame this decision? As an action guided by the same clarity that led you to Rome?\"\n\nHe waits for your response, the letter lying between you on the desk, the ink still drying.\n\nWhat do you say? Do you want to modify the letter, or keep it as is?",

But Juan is being honest - he genuinely feels the same certainty. The question is whether that certainty is divine guidance, strategic intuition, or dangerous overconfidence.\n\nI think Fray Hernando would:\n1. Appreciate Juan's honesty\n2. Still be deeply troubled\n3. Point out that even if Juan doesn't claim divine intervention, others will read it that way\n4. Ultimately defer to Juan's authority as king while maintaining his spiritual concern\n5. Perhaps suggest a small modification that keeps the truth but is less likely to be misinterpreted\n\nThis is good character development - Juan is increasingly comfortable with his certainty, while Fray Hernando grows increasingly worried about it. The dynamic between them is deepening.\n\nFray Hernando is quiet for a long moment, his fingers steepled before his face in thought. Then he lowers his hands and speaks carefully.\n\n\"You're right that we shouldn't conceal the truth. And I appreciate your honesty - that you're not claiming divine intervention, just this... certainty you feel.\" He pauses. \"But Your Majesty, here's what troubles me: you may not be claiming it's holy intervention, but when you compare this decision to your journey to Rome - which was blessed by God, which did result in extraordinary grace - others will make that connection for you.\"\n\nHe gestures to the letter.\n\n\"Álvaro will read this and think: 'My king felt this same clarity before Rome, and God validated that choice beyond all expectation. Therefore, this must also be God's will.' The nobles who hear about it will think the same. You're not explicitly claiming divine guidance, but you're creating the association in their minds.\"\n\nHe leans forward slightly.\n\n\"And that's dangerous, Juan. Because if this decision leads to civil war, if it ends badly, then people will say either that you were wrong about God's guidance - which damages your authority - or that God's will includes the bloodshed of civil war - which makes God seem capricious and cruel.\"\n\nHe picks up the quill again.\n\n\"May I suggest a small change? Keep the truth, but frame it differently. Perhaps: 'I am as certain of this decision as I have been of any I've made since beginning my personal rule' or 'I have considered this carefully and am resolved.' That communicates your certainty without creating the comparison to Rome.\"\n\nHe looks at you directly, his expression both respectful and concerned.\n\n\"You are my king, and I will write whatever you command. But as your spiritual advisor, I'm asking you to consider: is your certainty about this action truly the same as what you felt before Rome? Or does it just feel similar because you're confident in your judgment?\"\n\nHe sets down the quill.\n\n\"Because one was a leap of faith into the unknown, surrendering everything to God. The other is a calculated political move to punish rebels. Both might be correct decisions, but they're not the same kind of decision. And I worry that treating them as equivalent blurs the line between divine calling and human strategy.\"\n\nHe waits, watching your face.\n\n\"What would you like me to write, Your Majesty?\"\n\nWhat do you decide?

He says they're competent - not professional soldiers, but not fools either. They can ride, fight, and follow orders.

He says Captain Fernán informed him he'll be serving as military advisor while the Captain is away, and he wants to understand your expectations.\"\n\nWhat do you want to do first?

That shows real commitment.\n\nI'll make them diverse but believable - maybe different social classes, different reasons for coming, different skills. Not all perfect - some flawed but sincere.\n\nYou gather Fray Hernando and send for Sir Thomas, then descend to the palace courtyard. The afternoon sun slants across the cobblestones, casting long shadows from the surrounding buildings.\n\nCaptain Fernán stands with four men near the stables. They've clearly been put through their paces - they're sweating, breathing hard, and their horses show signs of recent hard riding. Several practice weapons lean against the stable wall.\n\nThe four men straighten as you approach, then bow - some more gracefully than others.\n\nCaptain Fernán steps forward. \"Your Majesty. These are the men who've come from Florence.\" He gestures to each in turn.\n\nThe first is perhaps thirty years old, lean and weather-beaten with a soldier's bearing. He wears plain traveling clothes but carries himself with professional competence. \"This is Marco Tornesi. Says he fought as a mercenary for Milan, then Genoa. Knows his way around a sword. Good rider. Speaks some Castilian - better than the others.\"\n\nMarco bows again, deeper this time. \"Your Majesty,\" he says in accented but understandable Castilian. \"I hear your speech in Florence. I see the banner. I...\" He searches for words. \"I fight for money many years. Always for money. When I see you, I think... maybe I fight for something else, yes? For God, for Christ. Before I am too old, before my soul is...\" He gestures vaguely, unable to find the word.\n\nThe second man is younger - mid-twenties - well-dressed in merchant's clothing that's now dusty from the road. He has soft hands but eager eyes. Captain Fernán continues: \"Pietro Aldobrandini. Wool merchant's son from Florence. Never fought in battle but he's been training. He's clumsy with a sword but enthusiastic. Can ride well enough. Has his own horse and funds to sustain himself.\"\n\nPietro bows energetically, speaking rapid Italian that you don't fully understand, though you catch words like \"Dio\" (God), \"croce\" (cross), and \"Granada.\"\n\nSir Thomas, standing beside you, murmurs quietly in your ear: \"The merchant's boy will need serious training before he's useful in combat. But that type can be surprisingly resilient if they survive the first real fight. The mercenary knows his business - you can see it in how he stands, how his eyes assess everything.\"\n\nThe third is older - perhaps forty-five - with graying hair and a limp. He's stocky, strong-looking despite the limp. \"Giovanni Rossi,\" Captain Fernán says. \"Former blacksmith from near Pisa. Lost three fingers on his left hand in an accident years ago. Says he can still fight right-handed and wants to serve God before he dies. The limp is from an old cart accident - won't slow him on horseback much.\"\n\nGiovanni bows stiffly. He speaks no Castilian, only Italian, but his eyes are fierce and determined. He pulls out a rosary from his shirt and kisses it, then points at you and makes the sign of the cross.\n\nThe fourth is the youngest - barely twenty - tall and gangly with the awkwardness of youth not yet grown into his frame. \"Andrea Vescovi,\" Captain Fernán says with slight skepticism. \"Farmer's son from countryside near Florence. Says his father died last year, his mother's remarried, and he has nothing to keep him home. Knows horses from farm work. Can't really fight yet but he's strong and willing to learn.\"\n\nThe young man - Andrea - looks nervous but determined. He clutches his cap in his hands, twisting it anxiously as he bows.\n\nCaptain Fernán crosses his arms. \"Marco the mercenary is the only real soldier among them. Pietro the merchant might become useful. Giovanni the blacksmith has the spirit but he's old and injured. Andrea the farm boy is raw material - could be shaped into something or could get himself killed in the first week.\"\n\nHe looks at you directly.\n\n\"They're not professional soldiers, Your Majesty. But they rode hard from Florence - ten days of brutal riding to catch you here. That shows commitment at least. Marco could help train the others if you give him that role. They could fill out your company's numbers while I'm away.\"\n\nSir Thomas adds his perspective: \"I've seen worse in English levies. At least they came voluntarily and they have some basic skills. With proper training and discipline...\" He shrugs. \"They might serve adequately. The key is whether they'll hold when it gets bloody.\"\n\nFray Hernando has been watching them all quietly. Now he steps forward and addresses them in Latin, which Marco and Pietro seem to understand somewhat, while Giovanni and Andrea look confused.\n\nHe switches to Italian, speaking slowly. You catch enough to understand he's asking them about their faith, their reasons for coming, whether they understand this is a holy crusade requiring spiritual discipline as well as martial courage.\n\nMarco responds in Italian, gesturing emphatically. Pietro nods eagerly, pulling out his own rosary. Giovanni just keeps making the sign of the cross and pointing upward. Andrea stammers something that sounds like a sincere if simple declaration of faith.\n\nFray Hernando turns to you and speaks quietly in Castilian so only you, Captain Fernán, and Sir Thomas can hear:\n\n\"They're sincere. Not perfectly holy - Marco has done things as a mercenary he's ashamed of, Pietro has the enthusiasm of youth but shallow understanding, Giovanni is simple but genuinely devout, Andrea barely comprehends what he's committing to. But...\" He pauses. \"They're not cynics. They're not just seeking adventure or plunder. Something in your speech moved them enough to drop their lives and ride for ten days. That counts for something.\"\n\nHe meets your eyes.\n\n\"If you accept them, I'll need to begin their spiritual formation immediately. Confession, instruction, helping them understand what it means to be crusaders rather than just soldiers. That's the work you asked me to do.\"\n\nThe four Italians wait, watching you with varying degrees of hope and nervousness. Around the courtyard, palace servants and guards have paused in their work to watch this scene.\n\nWhat do you do? Accept all four? Only some of them? What do you say to them?",

The Italians exchange glances, clearly uncertain what's happening. When you reach your chambers, García and Rodrigo stand at attention.\n\nThe banner case and reliquary chest sit where they were left. The afternoon light streams through the window, making the room glow.\n\nYou gesture for the Italians to stand back, then sink to your knees yourself at a respectful distance from the chest. You bow your head, clasp your hands, and pray silently. The room falls completely quiet - even the sounds from the street below seem to fade.\n\nAfter perhaps two minutes, you rise and turn to face the four men. In your careful Italian, you speak:\n\n\"What you see here... what these men guard... are the most sacred relics in Christendom.\" You pause to let that sink in. \"Inside that chest rests a fragment of the True Cross - the cross where Our Lord Jesus Christ died for our sins. And a bone of Santiago - Saint James himself, patron of Spain.\"\n\nPietro's hand flies to his mouth. Marco's eyes widen. Giovanni makes the sign of the cross repeatedly.

And tomorrow morning, I may welcome new crusaders into my company.\"\n\nYou gesture toward the chest.\n\n\"You have until dawn to search your souls. To pray. To decide if you are ready to offer everything - your lives, your futures, your very souls - to this holy cause. The crusade will not end in weeks or months. It may take years. You will fight. You may die. You will face hardship and suffering.\"\n\nYou look each man in the eye, one by one.\n\n\"If you choose this path, you serve God through me. You become crusaders - not mercenaries, not adventurers, but soldiers of Christ. My confessor, Fray Hernando, will guide you spiritually. You will confess regularly, take communion, live by Christian virtue. This is not just a war. It is a holy mission.\"\n\nYou gesture to García and Rodrigo.\n\n\"These men will allow you to pray before the relics if you wish. One at a time, with respect. Fray Hernando will be available if you seek counsel or confession.\"\n\nYou step back.\n\n\"At dawn tomorrow, you will tell me your decision. If you choose to join, you will swear an oath. If you choose to leave, you may do so with my blessing and no shame - it takes wisdom to know one's limits.\"\n\nYou nod to Fray Hernando, who steps forward and continues in Italian, explaining that he'll be in the adjacent chamber if any wish to speak with him.\n\nMarco the mercenary is the first to approach the chest. He kneels at the respectful distance you demonstrated, removes his cap, and stares at the chest for a long moment before bowing his head in prayer. His lips move silently. After several minutes, he makes the sign of the cross and rises, his weathered face showing something like awe mixed with fear.\n\nPietro the merchant's son approaches next, almost trembling with excitement and reverence. He kneels and his prayer is more animated - you can hear whispered Italian, see him gesturing. When he finishes, tears stream down his young face.\n\nGiovanni the blacksmith limps forward and drops heavily to both knees with a grunt. He pulls out his rosary and begins praying the Pater Noster aloud in Italian, his voice cracking with emotion. He prays three complete prayers before crossing himself and struggling back to his feet.\n\nAndrea the farm boy is last and most uncertain. He kneels awkwardly, clearly not accustomed to formal prayer beyond simple church attendance. He stares at the chest, then at you, then back at the chest. His lips move but you can't tell if he's praying or just overwhelmed. After a minute, he makes a clumsy sign of the cross and stands.\n\nCaptain Fernán watches all this with his professional soldier's assessment, but you notice even his eyes are slightly wet.\n\nSir Thomas murmurs quietly in English, which you don't fully understand, but his tone suggests he's impressed.\n\nThe evening passes. You dine simply in your chambers. María sends word that she's making arrangements for the cathedral display and meetings with the Archbishop - she'll have details tomorrow.\n\nThrough the wall, you can occasionally hear voices from the adjacent chamber where Fray Hernando meets with the Italians. Marco's voice, low and intense. Pietro's younger, more anxious tones. Giovanni's rough, simple declarations. Andrea's halting confessions.\n\nNight falls over Barcelona. The palace settles into quiet. Your guards maintain their watch - García and Rodrigo with the relics, the others at your door.\n\nYou sleep fitfully, knowing that tomorrow Captain Fernán departs on a mission that may ignite civil war, and that you may be welcoming the first of many crusaders who will follow you to Granada.\n\nDawn breaks on August 19, 1430.\n\nYou wake to the sound of horses being prepared in the courtyard below. Captain Fernán's voice giving quiet orders. The clink of tack and weapons.\n\nWhen you descend to the courtyard with Fray Hernando and Sir Thomas, you find:\n\nCaptain Fernán ready to depart with Martín and Felipe. All three are armed and provisioned for hard riding. Three fresh horses stamp and snort in the cool morning air. The sealed letter to Álvaro is secured in Captain Fernán's saddlebag.\n\nAnd standing in a nervous cluster near the stable: Marco, Pietro, Giovanni, and Andrea. All four are present. All four have chosen to stay.\n\nCaptain Fernán sees you and approaches, bowing. \"Your Majesty. We're ready to depart. And it seems...\" He glances at the four Italians. \"You have new crusaders to welcome.\"\n\nThe courtyard is quiet in the early morning light. A few servants and guards watch from doorways and windows. This is the moment - bidding farewell to your most trusted commander, and accepting the first of those who will follow your white banner to Granada.\n\nWhat do you do? What do you say to Captain Fernán? And how do you welcome the four Italians into your crusade?",

Then his voice becomes formal, the ritual of military command transfer that's been practiced for centuries.\n\n\"Corporal Rodrigo García, I hereby relinquish command of His Majesty's household guard. You are charged with the defense of the King's person, the security of the holy relics and treasury in our care, and the discipline and welfare of the men under your command.\"\n\nHe unbuckles his captain's sword belt - a finer weapon than the common guards carry, with worked leather and the royal insignia on the pommel - and holds it out.\n\n\"Do you accept this charge?\"\n\nRodrigo swallows hard, then speaks clearly: \"I do, Captain.\"\n\n\"Then serve the King with honor, protect him with your life, and lead with wisdom.\" Fernán buckles the sword belt around Rodrigo's waist, then steps back and salutes - fist to heart. \"Acting Captain Rodrigo.\"\n\nRodrigo returns the salute, his hand trembling slightly. \"Captain Fernán.\"\n\nAround the courtyard, García, the remaining guards, and even Martín and Felipe who are departing with Fernán, snap to attention and salute their new commander.\n\nCaptain Fernán turns back to you, and now his formality cracks slightly. He drops to one knee.\n\n\"Your Majesty, I will ride as fast as these horses can carry us. Two weeks to Valladolid, God willing. Don Álvaro will have your orders before September dawns.\" He looks up at you. \"And I will return to you in Seville. That's a promise.\"\n\nHis voice drops lower, for your ears primarily.\n\n\"Be careful in Barcelona. Trust Sir Thomas's tactical judgment - he knows war. Trust Rodrigo's loyalty - he'll die before he lets harm come to you. And trust your sister's political instincts - she knows this court better than any of us.\"\n\nHe rises, grips your forearm in the soldier's farewell, then turns to mount his horse. Martín and Felipe are already mounted, their faces showing the same mix of determination and apprehension that Fernán wears.\n\nThe three riders settle into their saddles. The horses sense their riders' urgency and prance restlessly.\n\nCaptain Fernán looks down at you one last time. \"Ride like the wind, you said. That we'll do, Your Majesty. For the crusade. For Castile.\" He touches his chest over his heart. \"Non nobis domine.\"\n\n\"Non nobis domine,\" you reply.\n\nHe wheels his horse toward the courtyard gate. Martín and Felipe fall in behind him. The three riders clatter across the cobblestones, through the gate, and into the Barcelona streets beyond.\n\nYou watch until they disappear around a corner, the sound of hoofbeats fading into the morning sounds of the waking city.\n\nWhen you turn back, Rodrigo stands straighter than you've ever seen him, his hand resting on his new sword. García has moved to stand beside him - the veteran sergeant supporting his young commander. Sir Thomas watches with the assessing eye of a professional, already calculating how to work with this new command structure.\n\nAnd the four Italians stand witnessing it all, understanding even through the language barrier that they've just seen something significant - a trusted commander departing on a dangerous mission, a young officer stepping up to replace him, and a king sending orders that may determine the fate of kingdoms.\n\nThe morning sun climbs higher over Barcelona.\n\nWhat do you do now? Welcome the four Italians formally as crusaders? Speak with Rodrigo about his new responsibilities? Address the assembled group? Something else?",

      "text": "Fray Hernando would take this seriously. He spent the evening with each man. He knows their sins, their doubts, their motivations from confession (though he can't reveal specifics). He needs to give an honest assessment without breaking the seal of confession.\n\nLet me think about what he might say about each man based on what we know:\n\nMarco - experienced mercenary, has done things he's ashamed of, but genuinely moved by the speech\nPietro - young merchant's son, enthusiastic but shallow understanding\nGiovanni - simple blacksmith, genuinely devout, physically limited\nAndrea - young farm boy, barely comprehends what he's committing to\n\nFray Hernando would be honest but also recognize that perfection isn't the standard - readiness to grow spiritually is.\n\nFray Hernando steps forward, his expression serious. He looks at the four Italians, then back to you. The morning light catches his weathered face, showing both the exhaustion of a long night hearing confessions and a certain quiet determination.\n\n\"Your Majesty, I have spoken with each of these men. I have heard their confessions - the content of which I cannot reveal, as you know. But I can speak to what I observed of their hearts and their readiness.\"\n\nHe clasps his hands before him, choosing his words carefully.\n\n\"Marco Tornesi has seen much war and done things that weigh on his soul. He came to me last night carrying burdens that have accumulated over years of fighting for whoever paid him. But...\" Fray Hernando's voice strengthens. \"He is deeply sincere in his desire to fight for something beyond coin. He wept during confession. He asked me - begged me - to help him understand how to be a soldier who serves God rather than mammon. He knows he is imperfect. That awareness itself is grace.\"\n\nHe turns slightly toward Pietro.\n\n\"Pietro Aldobrandini is young and his faith is... enthusiastic but not yet deep. He has lived a comfortable merchant's life, confessed sins of vanity and minor dishonesty in trade. But his heart is genuinely moved. He prayed for two hours last night after I spoke with him. He asked me what books he should read to understand the faith better. He wants to learn. That desire to grow is what matters.\"\n\nHe looks at Giovanni.\n\n\"Giovanni Rossi is perhaps the simplest soul I've encountered in years. His confession was brief - he works hard, he loves his family, he sometimes loses his temper, he drinks too much on feast days. But when he speaks of God, his face...\" Fray Hernando pauses, visibly moved. \"There is a purity there. He told me, 'Father, I am old and broken, but I want to do one good thing before I die. I want to fight for Christ.' How can I say such a man is not ready?\"\n\nFinally, his gaze settles on Andrea.\n\n\"Andrea Vescovi barely understands what he's committing to. His confession was confused - he's not sure what counts as sin, he's never really thought deeply about faith beyond Sunday Mass and festivals. He's...\" Fray Hernando searches for words. \"He's raw clay, Your Majesty. Unformed. But willing to be shaped. When I asked him why he came, he said simply, 'The king said we could serve God. I want to serve God.' Sometimes the simplest faith is the truest.\"\n\nFray Hernando turns fully to face you.\n\n\"Are they perfect? No. Are they deeply learned in theology? No. Will they struggle with sin and temptation throughout this crusade? Absolutely.\" He pauses. \"But Your Majesty, you spoke truly - we are all sinners. These four men know their imperfection and are willing to acknowledge it. They came to confession voluntarily. They prayed before the True Cross with genuine reverence. They are willing to submit to spiritual discipline and guidance.\"\n\nHis voice grows firmer.\n\n\"Yes, Your Majesty. In my judgment as your confessor and as a servant of Holy Church, these men are ready to become soldiers of Christ. They will need instruction, correction, and continued spiritual formation. But they are ready to begin. They have said yes to the call. That is enough to start.\"\n\nHe makes the sign of the cross over the four Italians.\n\n\"With your permission, I will formally receive their crusading vows and hear their oaths. They will become the first of many who follow the white banner to Granada.\"\n\nThe four Italians watch this exchange, understanding from tone and gesture if not from words that Fray Hernando has spoken in their favor. Marco stands straighter. Pietro wipes his eyes. Giovanni clutches his rosary. Andrea looks both terrified and determined.\n\nRodrigo, standing nearby in his new captain's sword belt, watches intently. García and the other guards have formed up to witness. Sir Thomas observes with professional interest. A few palace servants have gathered at the edges of the courtyard, drawn by the unusual morning assembly.\n\nWhat do you do? How do you formally accept them as crusaders?",

He lays out the terms clearly - Christian values, no rape, no forced conversions, protection of surrendered Muslims\n4. He specifically asks Andrea (the youngest, most uncertain) if he understands\n5. He uses his sword to tap Andrea's shoulder in a knighting/crusader ceremony\n6. He allows Andrea to touch the relics as a first and last time\n\nThis is significant because:\n- Juan is establishing the moral framework for his crusade\n- He's making a statement about protecting Muslim prisoners (very unusual for the era)\n- He's creating a solemn ceremony that will be remembered\n- He's showing real leadership in defining what his crusade will be\n\nI should describe:\n- The banner being brought out and unfurled\n- The crowd's reaction\n- Andrea's response to being singled out\n- The touching of the relics\n- Then presumably the same ceremony for the other three\n- The witnesses' reactions to this unusual oath\n\nLet me write this scene with appropriate gravity and detail.\n\nYou gesture to García and Rodrigo. They understand immediately and move swiftly back into the palace. The courtyard falls silent in anticipation.\n\nWhen they return, they carry the long wooden case between them carefully. They set it down and open the latches. Together, with reverent precision, they lift out the great white banner - already unfurled and with both reliquaries mounted as they were in Florence.\n\nThe morning sun catches the pure white silk and it seems to glow. The gold reliquary with the True Cross fragment blazes in the light. The silver reliquary with Santiago's bone gleams below it. Even those who've seen it before - Sir Thomas, Fray Hernando, your guards - draw in their breath.\n\nThe four Italians stare in wonder. Pietro falls to his knees spontaneously. Giovanni makes the sign of the cross over and over, tears already streaming down his weathered face.\n\nGarcía and Rodrigo hold the banner upright between them, the white silk moving gently in the morning breeze.\n\nYou speak in your careful Italian, your voice carrying across the courtyard:\n\n\"I grant you the possibility to be soldiers of Christ and to be part of our crusade against Granada. The Pope himself charged me with this sacred mission and gave me these two relics so they may be carried against the heathens.\"\n\nYou gesture toward the banner.\n\n\"I touched them once upon accepting this charge, and I grant every soldier of Christ the same grace. You have already spoken with my confessor and I expect you to continue to do so for as long as you remain a soldier of Christ in the crusade.\"\n\nYour voice grows more serious, more commanding.\n\n\"When you become part of the crusade, you accept me as your only commander and you will follow no other orders except from me or from those I put in command.\"\n\nYou pause, letting this sink in, then continue with particular emphasis:\n\n\"You commit to behave in accordance with Christian values and virtues. No raping or forced conversions. Those Muslims who surrender will be treated fairly. Not only will you not commit these acts yourself, but you also swear to prevent others from doing so.\"\n\nAround the courtyard, several palace servants exchange glances. This is unusual. Most crusade oaths speak of destroying the infidel, not protecting them.\n\n\"When I see surrendered Muslims that are about to be shamelessly executed by those who call themselves true Christians, I would defend these Muslims with my life and I expect you to do the same.\"\n\nYour voice rings with conviction.\n\n\"We are all sinners, but we swear to fight where we can for justice, mercy and compassion. That is what it truly means to be a soldier of Christ.\"\n\nYou turn specifically to Andrea, the youngest, the farm boy who looks terrified and awed in equal measure.\n\n\"Andrea, do you understand what you are about to commit to?\"\n\nAndrea swallows hard. His hands twist his cap. For a long moment he's silent, and you wonder if he'll flee. Then he drops to his knees, his voice cracking but clear enough to hear:\n\n\"Sì, Vostra Maestà. Capisco.\" (Yes, Your Majesty. I understand.) He struggles with the words, then adds in simpler Italian: \"I serve you. I serve Cristo. I protect... even Muslims who surrender. I be... I try to be good soldier of Christ.\"\n\nHis grammar is rough, his understanding perhaps incomplete, but his sincerity is absolute.\n\nYou draw your father's sword - the blade that bears the inscription Non Nobis Domine. The sound of steel leaving the scabbard is sharp in the quiet morning.\n\nYou step forward and tap Andrea gently on his right shoulder with the flat of the blade, then his left shoulder.\n\n\"I accept you, Andrea Vescovi, as the very first crusader and soldier of Christ in my crusade to retake Granada.\"\n\nAndrea's breath catches. Tears stream down his young face.\n\n\"You may now, for the first and last time in your life on this earth, touch the relics that you will help carry toward Granada.\"\n\nGarcía and Rodrigo lower the banner carefully, bringing the reliquaries to a height where Andrea can reach them while kneeling.\n\nAndrea stares at the gold reliquary containing the fragment of the True Cross. His hand trembles as he extends it. He touches the gold housing with just his fingertips, barely making contact, as if afraid he might damage it or isn't worthy. His lips move in silent prayer.\n\nThen he touches the silver reliquary with Santiago's bone. His whole body shakes with emotion.\n\nHe remains there for perhaps thirty seconds, his rough farmer's hand resting gently on the sacred vessels, tears falling freely onto the cobblestones beneath him.\n\nFinally he withdraws his hand, makes the sign of the cross, and looks up at you with an expression of such pure devotion that even hardened soldiers around the courtyard look away, overcome.\n\nYou help him to his feet. He can barely stand, his legs weak with emotion.\n\nYou turn to the other three. \"Who is next?\"\n\nMarco the mercenary steps forward without hesitation. He kneels with a soldier's practiced grace, his weathered face showing something you haven't seen there before - hope mixed with humility.\n\nHe speaks his oath in clear Italian, his voice steady: \"I understand, Your Majesty. I have killed for money. I have done shameful things. But I swear before God and these holy relics - I will follow your orders alone. I will protect the innocent. I will be a soldier of Christ, not of mammon. This I swear.\"\n\nYou tap his shoulders with your sword. \"I accept you, Marco Tornesi, as a crusader and soldier of Christ.\"\n\nMarco touches the relics firmly, confidently, like a man finally finding something solid to hold onto after years of drifting. When he rises, he salutes you with fist to heart - but then adds a bow of genuine respect that no mercenary would give for mere pay.\n\nPietro the merchant's son practically leaps forward, then remembers himself and drops to his knees more decorously. His youthful face shines with excitement and religious fervor.\n\n\"Your Majesty, I swear it all! I will follow you! I will be virtuous! I will protect even Muslims who surrender!\" His enthusiasm makes several guards smile despite the solemnity. \"I will be the best crusader I can be! I swear before God and Santiago!\"\n\nYou tap his shoulders. \"I accept you, Pietro Aldobrandini, as a crusader and soldier of Christ.\"\n\nPietro touches the relics and immediately begins weeping and praying loudly in Italian, thanking God, thanking you, thanking Santiago. After several moments, Fray Hernando gently touches his shoulder, and Pietro reluctantly rises, still sniffling.\n\nGiovanni the blacksmith limps forward last. He drops heavily to both knees with a grunt, his injured leg unable to manage a graceful kneel. His three-fingered hand clutches his rosary.\n\nHis Italian is rough, working-class, but clear: \"Maestà, I am old. I am broken. But I am strong still. I fight for Cristo. I follow you. I protect who you say protect. I die if I must. This is good. This is...\" He struggles for words, then simply says, \"This is what I want. To do good thing before I die.\"\n\nYou tap his shoulders. \"I accept you, Giovanni Rossi, as a crusader and soldier of Christ.\"\n\nGiovanni touches the relics with both his good hand and his damaged one, pressing them against the gold and silver as if trying to absorb their holiness through his skin. He prays in simple, repetitive phrases - thanking God, asking for strength, promising to serve. When he rises, he has to brace against the banner pole to stand, but his face shows peace.\n\nThe ceremony is complete. Four men have become crusaders - the first of what you hope will be thousands.\n\nFray Hernando steps forward and raises his hands, blessing the four new crusaders in Latin. Then he switches to Italian:\n\n\"You are soldiers of Christ now. You serve God through His anointed king. You carry the holy relics toward Granada. This is sacred work. Remember your oaths. Confess your sins regularly. Take communion. Live as Christians, fight as Christians, and if God wills it, die as Christians knowing your souls are saved.\"\n\nAround the courtyard, witnesses have multiplied. More palace servants, several of María's ladies, guards from the royal palace, even a few early-rising Barcelona citizens who heard something unusual was happening. They've watched this entire ceremony.\n\nOne of the palace guards - an Aragonese soldier - murmurs to his companion in Catalan, just loud enough for you to overhear: \"Did he just swear to defend surrendered Moors? That's... unusual.\"\n\nHis companion responds: \"Unusual? It's unprecedented. But did you see those men's faces? They believed every word.\"\n\nRodrigo, your new captain, stands watching with his hand on his sword. You see him reassessing the four Italians - no longer just potential recruits, but now sworn crusaders under his protection and command.\n\nSir Thomas approaches and speaks quietly in Latin so the Italians won't understand: \"Your Majesty, that oath about protecting surrendered Muslims... it's noble, but it will cause problems. Soldiers in the heat of battle, or after seeing their friends killed... they won't want to show mercy. You'll need iron discipline to enforce that.\"\n\nGarcía, the veteran sergeant, adds his perspective: \"But if you can enforce it, Your Majesty, you'll build an army different from any other. Men will know they serve something higher than blood and plunder.\"\n\nThe four new crusaders stand together now, Andrea still wiping his eyes, Pietro grinning despite his tears, Giovanni gripping his rosary, Marco standing with military bearing but softer eyes than he had an hour ago.\n\nThe white banner with its sacred relics stands between García and Rodrigo, catching the morning sun, visible to everyone in the courtyard and anyone looking down from palace windows above.\n\nWhat do you do now? Address the assembled witnesses? Speak to your new crusaders about their duties? Have the banner returned to its case? Something else?",

Felipe (guard) - DEPARTED with Captain Fernán\n8. Diego (secretary) - not a fighter\n9. Sir Thomas Beaumont (English knight)\n10. Peter (Sir Thomas's squire)\n\nSo three people departed: Captain Fernán, Martín, Felipe\n\nThat leaves:\n- Juan II (king)\n- Fray Hernando (confessor, not a fighter)\n- García (sergeant, experienced soldier)\n- Rodrigo (now acting captain, was a guard)\n- Diego (secretary, not a fighter)\n- Sir Thomas (knight, experienced soldier)\n- Peter (squire, can fight but young)\n\nRoyal guards specifically: García and Rodrigo are the original royal guards. But Rodrigo is now captain so shouldn't be doing regular guard rotations.\n\nJust added:\n- Marco Tornesi (mercenary, experienced soldier)\n- Pietro Aldobrandini (merchant's son, inexperienced)\n- Giovanni Rossi (blacksmith, old and injured but willing)\n- Andrea Vescovi (farm boy, inexperienced)\n\nSo for actual fighters/guards:\n- García (experienced royal guard)\n- Sir Thomas (experienced knight)\n- Peter (squire, some combat ability)\n- Marco (experienced mercenary)\n- Pietro (inexperienced but enthusiastic)\n- Giovanni (limited by age and injury)\n- Andrea (raw and inexperienced)\n\nRodrigo as captain oversees but shouldn't be in regular rotation.\n\nThe defensive lineup looks critically undermanned. With only a handful of truly capable fighters, protecting valuable cargo seems precarious. The mix of experienced soldiers and untrained recruits creates significant vulnerabilities in their security arrangement.\n\nRodrigo steps forward at your question, clearly already thinking through this same issue. He glances around at the assembled group, counting.\n\n\"Your Majesty, we're thin on experienced men now.\" He ticks off on his fingers. \"García is our only remaining royal guard with proper training. Sir Thomas is a knight with combat experience. Peter his squire has some skill. Diego is your secretary - he can use a knife but he's not a soldier.\"\n\nHe looks at the four new crusaders.\n\n\"Marco has mercenary experience - he's a real fighter. But Pietro, Giovanni, and Andrea...\" He pauses diplomatically. \"They need training before they can be trusted with guarding the relics alone.\"\n\nGarcía adds his gruff assessment: \"The boy Andrea is strong but green as spring grass. Pietro the merchant has enthusiasm but no discipline yet. Giovanni the smith has spirit but he's old and lame - in a real fight, he'd be a liability more than an asset.\"\n\nSir Thomas steps forward, speaking in Latin so the Italians won't understand: \"Your Majesty, by my count you have three reliable fighters besides yourself: García, myself, and Marco. Peter can serve adequately. The other three Italians need weeks of training before I'd trust them in combat.\"\n\nHe pauses, then continues: \"For guarding the relics and treasury, I suggest rotating pairs. García and Marco together - the veteran and the professional. Sir Thomas and Peter. That gives you two solid teams. The three inexperienced Italians can stand watch during daylight in safe locations, but not at night or in uncertain situations.\"\n\nRodrigo nods agreement. \"That's sound, Your Majesty. And I'll oversee everything as captain, ready to respond if there's trouble. But you're right - I can't be in regular guard rotation and command effectively.\"\n\nHe looks concerned. \"Your Majesty, forgive my bluntness, but we're stretched thin. Captain Fernán, Martín, and Felipe are gone. That's three experienced soldiers. We've added four men, but only one is combat-ready. Until the others are trained...\"\n\nGarcía adds: \"We're adequate for Barcelona - it's a safe city, we're in the royal palace. But if we face real danger on the road or in hostile territory, we'll be vulnerable. We need more trained men, Your Majesty. Proper soldiers, not enthusiastic boys and old smiths.\"\n\nThe four new crusaders stand nearby, understanding from tone if not words that they're being assessed and found wanting in some ways. Marco stands straight, clearly confident in his abilities. Pietro looks slightly deflated. Giovanni seems unbothered - he knows his limitations. Andrea just looks confused.\n\nHow do you want to organize the guard rotations? And do you plan to recruit more soldiers while in Barcelona?",

But you're right - if Granada has been mobilizing and receiving support from North Africa as the rumors suggest...\"\n\nSir Thomas steps forward, his expression thoughtful. \"Your Majesty, the sea route is normally faster - perhaps a week from Barcelona to Seville by galley with good winds. The land route through Aragon and into Castile would take three weeks, possibly four if we encounter difficulties.\"\n\nHe pauses, clearly weighing options.\n\n\"But the Mediterranean has become more dangerous if Granada has war galleys active. And corsairs...\" He frowns. \"They'd love to capture a ship carrying the King of Castile, not to mention holy relics and a fortune in crusade funds. Even a well-armed merchant galley could be overwhelmed by multiple war galleys working together.\"\n\nGarcía adds his gruff perspective: \"On land, Your Majesty, we can see threats coming. We can choose our route, avoid dangerous areas, camp where we want. On a ship, if we're spotted and pursued, there's nowhere to run. We're trapped on a wooden box in the middle of the sea.\"\n\nHe scratches his beard. \"But land travel through Aragon... that means passing through territory where the Infantes have influence. Through areas where your enemies might have sympathizers. Word of your route could leak, and ambushes could be prepared.\"\n\nRodrigo weighs in: \"With only seven capable fighters - counting you, Your Majesty - we're vulnerable either way. On a ship, we're dependent on the crew and captain. On land, we can at least control our own defense, but we're exposed to bandits, hostile nobles, or worse.\"\n\nSir Thomas adds: \"There's also the matter of time, Your Majesty. You have the Royal Council in Seville on November 8th. It's now August 19th. You wanted to spend two to three weeks here in Barcelona building support. That puts us departing Barcelona in early September. Three to four weeks overland means arriving in Seville in late September or early October - giving you a month to prepare before the Council. That's adequate but not generous.\"\n\nHe continues: \"By sea, you'd arrive mid-September with six weeks to prepare. That extra time could be valuable for coordinating with Don Álvaro, meeting with supporters, planning your presentation of the crusade bull.\"\n\nRodrigo looks uncomfortable giving advice on such a weighty decision so soon after assuming command, but he tries: \"Your Majesty, perhaps... could we gather more intelligence first? Your sister might know the current state of Granada's naval activity. Are their galleys actively patrolling? Have there been recent attacks on Christian shipping? That information would help us decide.\"\n\nGarcía nods. \"And we could hire local guides who know the land routes - which roads are safest, which areas to avoid. Get a better sense of the actual dangers before committing.\"\n\nSir Thomas adds: \"We could also consider a mixed approach - travel overland through Aragon to the Castilian border, then reassess. If the situation seems safe, we could take ship from Valencia or Cartagena for just the final leg. That reduces sea exposure while still saving some time.\"\n\nAll three men look at you, waiting for your decision or guidance. The four new Italian crusaders watch without understanding the discussion, but sensing its importance.\n\nFrom a palace window above, you catch a glimpse of movement - someone watching. One of María's ladies, perhaps, or palace servants observing the foreign king and his deliberations.\n\nWhat do you decide? Gather more intelligence first? Choose a route now?

Witty and perceptive. Questions assumptions politely but persistently.\n\nChallenge: Politically appropriate match, but would tie Juan to Catalan nobility and complicate his independence. Her father serves Alfonso V, creating potential conflict of interest.\n\nHook: She's fascinated by Juan's spiritual journey but skeptical of certainty - echoes Fray Hernando's concerns in a different voice.\n\n2 - Isabel Ruiz\n\nAge: 17\n\nStatus: Daughter of a wealthy Barcelona merchant (converso - Jewish convert to Christianity)\n\nPosition: Friend of María's, occasionally at court for social events\n\nAppearance: Auburn hair (unusual), pale skin, freckles, bright green eyes\n\nPersonality: Passionate about faith, having grown up in a converso family constantly proving their Christianity. Earnest, idealistic, sees Juan as embodiment of true Christian virtue.\n\nChallenge: Converso background would be controversial among nobility. Her idealization of Juan might be uncomfortable - she sees him as nearly saintly.\n\nHook: Her family could provide financial backing for the crusade, but romance would be seen as marrying \"beneath\" his station.\n\n3 - Beatriz Álvarez\n\nAge: 19\n\nStatus: Impoverished distant relation of the Mendoza family\n\nPosition: María's handmaiden, essentially a servant though technically noble blood\n\nAppearance: Pretty in a simple way, brown hair usually hidden under a servant's cap, warm brown eyes, work-roughened hands\n\nPersonality: Quiet, observant, surprisingly educated (taught to read by a kindly priest). Devout but practical. Sees through pretense.\n\nChallenge: Far too low status for a king. Any relationship would be scandalous. Would be seen as Juan using his power inappropriately.\n\nHook: She witnessed his ceremony with the crusaders and was moved to tears. She embodies the common people's faith he spoke about in Florence.\n\n4 - Leonor de Montcada\n\nAge: 22\n\nStatus: Daughter of one of Catalonia's most powerful families\n\nPosition: Widow (married at 16, husband died a year ago in Italian wars), now living with Queen María\n\nAppearance: Striking rather than beautiful, tall, dark eyes that have seen grief, dresses in subdued colors\n\nPersonality: Mature beyond her years, melancholic but not broken. Intelligent, politically astute. Understands loss and duty.\n\nChallenge: Politically powerful match - Montcada support would be valuable but comes with strings. She's older than Juan and might dominate the relationship. Some whisper she's unlucky (young widow).\n\nHook: She understands the weight of duty and sacrifice in ways most don't. Their conversations could be profound but also dangerous to his certainty.\n\n5 - Margarita \"Margot\" Ferrer\n\nAge: 18\n\nStatus: Apothecary's daughter from Barcelona's merchant quarter\n\nPosition: Sometimes delivers medicines to the palace, no formal court position\n\nAppearance: Blonde (unusual in Spain), blue eyes, practical clothing, often smells faintly of herbs\n\nPersonality: Sharp-minded, educated in medicine and herbs by her father. Skeptical of nobility but curious about the world. Speaks bluntly, unimpressed by titles.\n\nChallenge: Common-born, completely inappropriate match. She'd challenge his assumptions constantly. Romance would be pure scandal.\n\nHook: She might be called to palace if someone falls ill. Her practical, no-nonsense approach to life contrasts sharply with Juan's spiritual intensity. She'd question whether certainty is faith or pride.\n\n6 - Sister Teresa María\n\nAge: 21\n\nStatus: Nun, formerly minor Aragonese nobility (family name: Ximénez)\n\nPosition: From convent of Santa Clara in Barcelona, sometimes sent to palace to assist with Queen María's charitable work\n\nAppearance: Habit conceals most features, but glimpses of dark hair, pale skin, delicate features. Moves with quiet grace.\n\nPersonality: Deeply pious, took vows at 17 after a religious experience. Gentle, compassionate, but with core of steel. Sees God's hand in everything.\n\nChallenge: This would be catastrophic - she's a bride of Christ, her vows are sacred. Any romantic feeling would be sinful for both. Would force Juan to confront his own humanity vs. his spiritual mission.\n\nHook: She heard about his offering before the Pope and wants to meet him. Their spiritual conversations could be profound but also dangerous - two people certain of God's will, but in different ways.\n\nEach option creates different tensions:\n\nOptions 1 & 4: Politically appropriate but complicated\n\nOptions 2 & 3: Sympathetic but socially inappropriate\n\nOption 5: Complete commoner, maximum social barrier\n\nOption 6: Spiritually impossible, maximum internal conflict\n\nRoll 1d6 to determine which woman catches Juan's eye during his time in Barcelona.",

      "text": "Now, back to the practical question about ships and the journey. Juan is asking if acquiring multiple ships would make them safer. This is actually a smart strategic question.\n\nLet me have Rodrigo and Sir Thomas respond to this with practical military/naval considerations.\n\nRodrigo's eyebrows rise slightly at the question - clearly he hadn't considered this option. He looks to Sir Thomas, who has more naval experience.\n\nSir Thomas nods thoughtfully. \"Your Majesty, that's actually sound military thinking. Multiple ships reduce risk in several ways.\"\n\nHe ticks off points on his fingers:\n\n\"First, if one ship is damaged or attacked, you don't lose everything. The relics, treasury, and your person could be distributed across vessels - if corsairs take one, they don't capture it all. Second, multiple ships can defend each other. Three merchant galleys traveling together are much less attractive targets than one alone. Pirates prefer easy prey.\"\n\nHe pauses, considering.\n\n\"Third, and perhaps most important - if we hire multiple ships, we control the small fleet. We're not just passengers dependent on one captain's decisions. We could have our own men on each vessel, coordinate our movements, choose our route together.\"\n\nGarcía adds his perspective: \"And it means more swords if we need to fight. Even if the crews are merchants, not warriors, three ships means triple the manpower. That matters in a boarding action.\"\n\nRodrigo nods, warming to the idea. \"Your Majesty, it would also give us flexibility. If one ship has problems - storms damage it, illness breaks out among the crew - we can transfer to another. We're not trapped with one option.\"\n\nSir Thomas continues: \"The question is cost and coordination. Three galleys from Barcelona to Seville...\" He calculates mentally. \"Probably 5,000-6,000 florins total, possibly more if we want quality vessels with experienced crews. And we'd need to ensure they all sail together - that requires coordination, possibly hiring captains who've worked together before.\"\n\nHe strokes his beard thoughtfully.\n\n\"There's also the question of what we're protecting and how we divide it. The relics and you, Your Majesty, should obviously be on the flagship - the best and fastest vessel. The treasury could be split across the other ships. We'd need guards distributed across all three vessels.\"\n\nGarcía points out: \"That spreads our fighters thin, Your Majesty. Seven capable men across three ships means maybe two or three per vessel. Each ship becomes more vulnerable individually, even though the fleet is stronger together.\"\n\nRodrigo adds: \"We'd need to decide command structure too. Who leads each ship's contingent? Marco could command one, Sir Thomas another, García the third with you and me on the flagship. But that separates our experienced fighters.\"\n\nSir Thomas nods. \"It's a trade-off, Your Majesty. Greater overall security but more complex logistics. And there's another consideration - three ships are more visible than one. We'd attract more attention in every port. Harder to move quietly if that's what you wanted.\"\n\nHe looks at you directly.\n\n\"But if your concern is Granada's naval strength, then yes - multiple ships significantly improve your odds of reaching Seville safely. It's sound strategy, just expensive and complicated.\"\n\nRodrigo ventures: \"Your Majesty, perhaps we could ask your sister? Queen María would know which Barcelona shipping houses are reliable, which captains work well together, what the current costs are. She might even be able to arrange favorable terms through her position.\"\n\nGarcía adds pragmatically: \"And we should still gather intelligence about Granada's fleet. If their galleys aren't actually operating this far north, we might be spending a fortune on extra ships we don't need. But if they are a real threat...\" He shrugs. \"Then three ships could be the difference between reaching Seville and being captured.\"\n\nThe morning is advancing - you can hear the palace coming fully to life around you. The four new Italian crusaders stand waiting for direction. The banner still rests in the courtyard, catching sunlight.\n\nWhat do you want to do? Consult with María about ships and Granada's naval activity? Make a decision about the route now? Focus on other matters first while you gather information?",

      "text": "1. He wants to petition Aragon for safe naval passage to Seville\n2. He clarifies that the four guards of the banner (García, Rodrigo, and... wait, Rodrigo is now captain. Let me check who the four guards are now.)\n\nActually, looking back:\n- Originally it was Captain Fernán, García, Rodrigo, and Felipe rotating guard on the banner\n- But now Fernán, Felipe, and Martín have left for Castile\n- Rodrigo is now captain\n- So the guard rotation was reorganized to: García and Marco as one pair, Sir Thomas and Peter as another pair\n\nSo Juan is saying he wants these guards to stay with the banner - meaning if they travel by multiple ships, the banner and its guards all go on the same ship. That makes sense.\n\n3. He's telling them to prepare for cathedral display\n4. He's delegating recruitment to Rodrigo and spiritual formation to Fray Hernando\n5. He's asking about arming the new recruits\n\nLet me have Rodrigo respond about the equipment situation, and also address the practical implications of Juan's decisions.\n\nRodrigo straightens at your clear direction. \"Understood, Your Majesty. The banner and its guards stay together on one ship - no separation. That's simpler and maintains our sacred charge properly.\"\n\nHe glances at the four Italians, assessing them with his new captain's eye.\n\n\"As for arming the new recruits... García and I have already discussed this. The palace armory here might lend us some equipment, or we'll need to purchase from Barcelona smiths. Let me outline what we need:\"\n\nHe counts on his fingers:\n\n\"Marco already has his own weapons - a good sword, a dagger, basic traveling gear. He's equipped. Pietro brought money and purchased a sword in Florence, but it's decorative, meant for a gentleman. We'll need to get him a proper weapon. Giovanni has a smith's hammer he's used as a weapon before, and blacksmith's strength, but he needs a real mace or axe suited to his build and his missing fingers. Andrea has nothing but a farm knife.\"\n\nHe pauses, calculating.\n\n\"Basic equipment for the three who need it - swords or other weapons, some leather armor, helmets, shields - probably 800-1,000 florins total. We could outfit them more cheaply with simpler gear, or spend more for quality equipment that will last the entire crusade.\"\n\nSir Thomas adds: \"Your Majesty, there's also the question of whether to arm them with what they can use now versus training them for what they should use. Andrea is strong - he could learn to use a pike or pollaxe. But that takes training. A simple sword and shield is easier to learn quickly but less effective in formation fighting.\"\n\nGarcía grunts: \"The boy needs a shield and something he can't hurt himself with. Maybe a mace. Simple, effective, hard to mess up. The merchant's son needs proper sword training before we give him anything sharp. The smith...\" He nods toward Giovanni. \"Give him a proper war hammer. He knows how to swing a hammer already.\"\n\nRodrigo nods agreement, then continues:\n\n\"I'll arrange purchases today or tomorrow. The sooner they have equipment, the sooner they can start training with it properly - you're absolutely right about that, Your Majesty.\" He looks more confident now, settling into his role. \"And I'll be ready to assess any new crusaders who approach. Father Hernando and I will work together - I judge their martial capability, he judges their spiritual readiness.\"\n\nFray Hernando inclines his head. \"I will continue as we've begun, Your Majesty. Any man who wishes to join will speak with me, confess, and prove their sincerity before being presented to you.\"\n\nRodrigo shifts to your other directives:\n\n\"For the cathedral display, Your Majesty - when do you want this to happen? Today? Tomorrow? And how long should the relics remain on display? A few hours? All day? Multiple days?\" He's thinking through security logistics. \"We'll need guards posted, crowd control, someone to prevent people from pressing too close or trying to touch the reliquaries...\"\n\nSir Thomas adds: \"It will draw enormous crowds, Your Majesty. Everyone in Barcelona will want to see the True Cross. We should coordinate with the cathedral guards and city watch. It needs to be managed properly or it could become chaos.\"\n\nFray Hernando speaks up: \"Your Majesty, might I suggest the display coincide with Mass? Perhaps tomorrow morning - that way the Bishop can properly frame the viewing within liturgy, explain the significance, maintain proper reverence. It becomes a sacred event, not just spectacle.\"\n\nRodrigo nods. \"That's wise, Father. And it gives us today to prepare, coordinate with cathedral authorities, ensure proper security.\"\n\nHe looks at you. \"Should I speak with Queen María about arrangements? She could facilitate coordination with the Bishop and cathedral authorities. And regarding your petition to Aragon for safe passage...\" He hesitates slightly. \"That would also go through her, wouldn't it? Or did you mean to approach the Consell Reial directly?\"\n\nGarcía adds gruffly: \"And this intelligence gathering about Granada's fleet - who does that? Do we ask the Queen's contacts? Send men to the docks to talk to sailors? Visit merchant houses that trade in the Mediterranean?\"\n\nThe four Italian crusaders are beginning to look restless, standing at attention but clearly uncertain what they're supposed to do now. Pietro keeps glancing at the banner with obvious longing. Marco stands professionally but you can see he's wondering about his next orders. Giovanni shifts his weight off his bad leg. Andrea just looks overwhelmed by everything.\n\nWhat are your priorities? Meet with María to arrange cathedral display and discuss safe passage? Have Rodrigo start working on equipment immediately? Address the new crusaders about their immediate duties? Something else?",

The Italians will be relieved to have clear direction. Then we can move to the planning discussion.\n\nRodrigo nods immediately. \"Yes, Your Majesty.\"\n\nHe turns to the four Italians and switches to Italian - his accent is rough but understandable. \"You four - come with García. We start training now. Basic sword work, formation drills. Move!\"\n\nGarcía steps forward with the no-nonsense efficiency of a veteran sergeant.

      "text": "**Factors favoring success:**\n\n1. **The relics themselves** - Fragment of the True Cross and bone of Saint James are extraordinarily powerful. People in medieval Barcelona would be desperate to see these. Religious fervor is real and intense.\n\n2. **Papal authority** - The crusade bull from Pope Martin V carries immense weight. The church hierarchy must respect it.\n\n3. **Florence precedent** - Juan already proved this approach works spectacularly in Florence (critical success). Word of that has likely reached Barcelona.\n\n4. **María's support** - His sister is Queen of Aragon, managing the court. She can facilitate meetings, arrange access, smooth political complications.\n\n5. **Archbishop of Zaragoza present** - The most important ecclesiastical figure in Aragon, who leads the Consell Reial, is in Barcelona. Direct access to him is valuable.\n\n6. **Smart execution** - Keeping relics in cathedral (sacred space, better security), limiting display time (creates scarcity/urgency), having papal bull read aloud multiple times, clear donation/recruitment mechanisms. This shows Juan has learned from Florence.\n\n7. **Time available** - Staying \"for a while\" allows sustained impact, multiple viewings, word to spread, recruitment to build.\n\n8. **Testing recruits** - Rodrigo and Hernando filtering candidates ensures quality, which builds reputation.\n\n**Factors complicating success:**\n\n1. **This is Barcelona, not Florence** - Barcelona is Alfonso V's city. The Infantes have influence here. Political complications that didn't exist in Florence.\n\n2. **Competing loyalties** - Catalans are proud of their independence. They may be cautious about committing to a Castilian king's crusade, even with papal backing.\n \nThe Infantes' reputation campaign creates significant doubt. Their strategic narrative portrays Juan as unstable and mystical, potentially undermining his credibility among nobles. This deliberate character assassination could predispose key decision-makers to skepticism about his crusade mission.\n\nAlfonso V's absence in Naples adds another layer of uncertainty. Without the king's clear endorsement, potential supporters might hesitate, waiting to understand the official royal position on Juan's ambitious crusade plans.\n\nThe impending tension from Juan's orders to Captain Fernán to arrest the Infantes looms like an unresolved threat. Politically astute observers can sense the brewing conflict, which could distract from or undermine the crusade recruitment efforts.\n\nEconomic challenges remain a critical unknown factor that could dramatically impact the crusade's potential success. The Florence campaign's success will spark curiosity and excitement in Barcelona, creating a ripple of anticipation. María's strategic involvement ensures key participants are engaged and potential political barriers are smoothed over.\n\nI'm confident this effort will succeed. The combination of powerful religious symbols, papal authority, and carefully orchestrated presentation makes failure unlikely. While Barcelona's political landscape presents nuanced challenges, the underlying momentum of religious fervor and Juan's sophisticated approach strongly favor a positive outcome.\n\nSuccess hinges on generating significant public and institutional support. Potential scenarios range from moderate engagement with modest donations and recruits to an overwhelming response that transforms Juan's regional standing. The key metrics include turnout, financial contributions, quality of candidates attracted, and institutional backing from religious and political leaders.\n\nRisks exist - political caution or unexpected disruptions could temper the campaign's impact. However, the foundational elements are robust: compelling relics, papal endorsement, and María's expert facilitation significantly mitigate potential setbacks.\n\nProbability Assessment: Barcelona Cathedral Display and Recruitment Campaign\n\nRodrigo, Fray Hernando, and Diego all nod, understanding their roles. Rodrigo departs immediately to coordinate with the cathedral. Fray Hernando begins preparing for his pastoral role during the display.\n\nBefore you proceed to meet with María, I need to assess the likelihood of success for this multi-faceted action.\n\nFactors Favoring Success:\n\nThe Sacred Relics - A fragment of the True Cross and Saint James's bone are extraordinarily powerful in this era. Religious fervor in medieval Barcelona is intense and genuine.\n\nPapal Authority - The crusade bull from Pope Martin V carries immense weight. Church hierarchy, including the Archbishop of Zaragoza, must respect direct papal commission.\n\nFlorence Precedent - You've already proven this approach works spectacularly. Word of Florence has reached Barcelona, creating anticipation and curiosity.\n\nSmart Execution - Keeping relics in cathedral (sacred space, better security), limiting display time (creates urgency), having bull read aloud repeatedly, clear donation/recruitment mechanisms, quality filtering of recruits. You've learned from Florence.\n\nQueen María's Support - Your sister manages Alfonso's court in his absence. She can facilitate meetings with the Archbishop, smooth political complications, ensure the right people attend.\n\nArchbishop of Zaragoza Present - Direct access to the man who leads the Consell Reial is extremely valuable. If he's impressed, doors open throughout Aragon.\n\nTime Available - Multi-day display allows sustained impact, word to spread, recruitment to build naturally.\n\nFactors Complicating Success:\n\nThis is Alfonso V's City - Political complications that didn't exist in Florence. The Infantes have influence here. Some Aragonese may be cautious about committing to a Castilian king's crusade.\n\nCompeting Loyalties - Catalans are fiercely proud of their independence. They may be wary of Castilian projects even with papal backing.\n\nThe Infantes' Narrative - Juan and Enrique have been spreading stories about you being unstable and dominated by Álvaro. Some nobles may be predisposed to doubt.\n\nAlfonso V's Absence and Unclear Position - The king is in Naples. His view of your crusade is uncertain. Some may wait to see what Alfonso says before committing resources.\n\nEconomic Competition - Catalan merchants may be less enthusiastic than Florentines about funding a crusade that primarily benefits Castile.\n\nPolitical Timing - Captain Fernán rides with orders to arrest the Infantes. Though this hasn't happened yet, some politically astute observers might sense coming instability.\n\nOverall Assessment:\n\nThe religious power of the relics and papal authority cannot be overstated in this era. Even politically cautious nobles must respect a papal crusade bull, especially after witnessing the True Cross. The Archbishop, as a church leader, would find it extremely difficult to oppose such clear papal commission.\n\nYou're not asking Barcelona to choose sides in Castilian politics - you're displaying papal relics and recruiting for a church-sanctioned crusade. That's much safer for people to support than political maneuvering.\n\nMaría's facilitation, your proven success in Florence, and the smart execution all point toward success. The complications are real but insufficient to prevent a positive outcome.\n\nI assess this action as: HIGH PROBABILITY OF SUCCESS\n\nPossible Outcomes:\n\nGreat Success:\n\nOverwhelming response rivaling or exceeding Florence\n\nSubstantial donations (30,000-50,000 florins)\n\n40-60 quality crusader recruits\n\nArchbishop of Zaragoza becomes active champion of your crusade\n\nMajor Catalan noble houses begin pledging support\n\nAlfonso V receives reports forcing him to acknowledge your legitimacy\n\nYour reputation in Aragon transformed\n\nSuccess:\n\nStrong turnout and genuine religious fervor\n\nSignificant donations (15,000-25,000 florins)\n\n20-35 quality recruits after filtering\n\nArchbishop impressed and supportive, willing to advocate to Consell Reial\n\nSeveral minor noble houses pledge support\n\nFoundation laid for broader Aragonese backing\n\nYour reputation enhanced in Catalonia\n\nFailure:\n\nModest turnout, political caution dominates religious enthusiasm\n\nLimited donations (5,000-10,000 florins)\n\n10-15 recruits, many of questionable quality\n\nArchbishop polite but noncommittal\n\nCatalan nobility remains neutral\n\nTime somewhat wasted, little progress made\n\nCatastrophic Failure:\n\nSomething goes wrong during display (theft attempt, riot, crowd accident)\n\nPolitical backlash from Alfonso's supporters who see this as Castilian manipulation\n\nArchbishop criticizes or opposes elements of your approach\n\nYour reputation damaged in Aragon as overreaching or politically naive\n\nInfantes' narrative about instability seems validated\n\nRecruitment and donations negligible\n\nPlease roll your dice and tell me the result: Great Success, Success, Failure, or Catastrophic Failure.",

      "text": "Great Success for Juan's Barcelona cathedral display and recruitment campaign. This is going to be a major turning point. Let me think through how this would unfold over several days:\n\nDay 1 (August 20): The cathedral display begins\nDay 2-3: Word spreads, crowds grow\nDay 4-5: Political implications manifest, Archbishop responds\nDay 6-7: Major commitments made, recruitment surges\n\nThis is Alfonso V's own city, so the success here is particularly significant - it puts pressure on Alfonso to respond positively and undermines the Infantes' narrative completely.\n\nKey elements to include:\n1. The cathedral display itself - religious fervor\n2. Archbishop of Zaragoza's reaction - critical for political support\n3. Donations pouring in - from various sources\n4. Quality crusader recruits - Rodrigo and Fray Hernando's filtering process\n5. Major Catalan noble houses beginning to commit\n6. Word reaching Alfonso in Naples\n7. The contrast with Infantes' failure to rally support\n8. María's role in facilitating\n9. Introduction of Isabel (the converso merchant's daughter) during this - she needs to appear naturally\n\nActually, I should also introduce Isabel during these events. She's the daughter of a wealthy Barcelona merchant (converso). This is a perfect opportunity - her family would definitely be involved in the crusade display and might make a donation. Juan could meet her at one of the events around the cathedral display or through María.\n\nLet me craft this carefully, showing the building momentum over several days, the religious and political impact, and naturally introducing Isabel.\n\nThe Barcelona Triumph - August 20-27, 1430\n\nDay One: August 20 - The Cathedral Display Begins\n\nThe morning dawns clear and warm. By the time you arrive at Barcelona Cathedral with your company, Rodrigo has done his work well. Wooden barriers have been erected in a large rectangle before the main altar, creating a sacred space perhaps twenty feet on each side. The white banner stands mounted on a sturdy pole inside this enclosure, the reliquaries gleaming in the light from the cathedral's high windows.\n\nGarcía, Marco, and two cathedral guards stand at the four corners of the barrier. Your other guards wait at the cathedral entrances, managing the crowd already forming.\n\nArchbishop Juan Martínez de Zaragoza arrived at dawn when Rodrigo sent word through María. He's perhaps fifty years old, lean and ascetic-looking, with intelligent eyes that miss nothing. He stands near the altar in full vestments, clearly moved by what he's seeing.\n\nThe Mass begins at the ninth hour. Perhaps 800 people pack the cathedral - more than it's seen in months for a regular morning Mass. The Bishop of Barcelona celebrates, with the Archbishop of Zaragoza concelebrating in a show of ecclesiastical unity.\n\nWhen the moment comes to display the relics, Fray Hernando steps forward. In clear Latin that echoes through the cathedral, then repeated in Catalan, then Castilian, he proclaims:\n\n\"Behold the fragment of the True Cross, upon which Our Lord Jesus Christ died for the sins of all mankind. Behold the bone of Santiago Matamoros, Saint James the Moor-slayer, patron of Spain, who guides Christian warriors to victory.\"\n\nThe congregation surges forward to see, then stops at the barriers. Many drop to their knees. Some weep openly. The sound of eight hundred people praying fills the vast space.\n\nAfter Mass, Fray Hernando and two cathedral priests take turns explaining the relics' significance, telling the story of your journey to Rome, your offering before Pope Martin V, the crusade bull's granting. They read key passages from the bull itself - the Pope's commission, the call to all Christians, the indulgences offered.\n\nThroughout the morning, people process slowly past the barriers, four or five deep, straining to see the reliquaries. Your guards maintain order firmly but respectfully. Anyone trying to climb the barrier is pushed back, but gently.\n\nArchbishop of Zaragoza spends an hour simply watching. You see him studying you, the relics, the crowd's reaction, the guards' discipline. Eventually he approaches where you stand to one side.\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" he says quietly in cultured Castilian. \"I received Queen María's invitation to attend this morning. I confess I came partially from curiosity and partially from duty.\" He pauses. \"But I have witnessed something remarkable. The people's response is... genuine. Not manipulated, not theatrical. They believe.\"\n\nHe gestures toward the relics. \"And these are authentic. I can see the papal seals, the documentation. Cardinal Orsini's letter to me confirms everything.\" He meets your eyes. \"Pope Martin does not grant such commissions lightly. For him to give you the True Cross itself...\"\n\nYou spend an hour in private conversation with him in a side chapel. He asks probing questions about Rome, your motivations, your plans for the crusade. You're honest - about the political challenges, the religious purpose, the mixing of worldly necessity with spiritual calling.\n\n\"Most men would pretend otherwise,\" he says finally. \"Would claim pure piety while pursuing pure politics. Your honesty is... unusual for a king.\" He makes his decision. \"I will support your crusade before the Consell Reial. Not immediately - I must be politically careful - but I will advocate that Aragon should not hinder you, and should consider how we might assist.\"\n\nThat afternoon, donations begin. A table is set up near the cathedral entrance with Diego managing records. By evening: 3,800 florins, mostly in small amounts from common people - a few silver coins each, precious to those who give them.\n\nDay Two-Three: August 21-22 - Word Spreads\n\nBarcelona awakens to news of the display. By mid-morning on the 21st, the cathedral is packed beyond capacity. The city watch helps manage crowds that stretch into the plaza outside.\n\nRodrigo and Fray Hernando establish a system for those wanting to join the crusade. They set up in a side chapel:\n\nPhysical Assessment (Rodrigo with Sir Thomas and García):\n\nCan they ride? Basic horsemanship tested.\n\nCan they fight? Shown practice weapons, asked to demonstrate.\n\nAre they physically capable? Age, health, strength evaluated.\n\nDo they have resources? Can they equip themselves or need support?\n\nSpiritual Assessment (Fray Hernando):\n\nWhy do they want to join?\n\nConfession and discussion of faith\n\nUnderstanding of crusading vows\n\nAssessment of genuine commitment vs. adventure-seeking\n\nDay 21: Twenty-three men apply. After assessment, eight are presented to you as suitable. You accept six - two are too obviously seeking adventure rather than service.\n\nDay 22: Thirty-one men apply. Rodrigo rejects twelve immediately for being too old, too young, physically incapable, or obviously unsuitable. Fray Hernando speaks with nineteen. Nine are presented to you. You accept seven.\n\nMaría arranges for major merchant houses and noble families to attend the display. On the evening of August 22, she hosts a dinner at the royal palace. Forty guests - Barcelona's elite.\n\nYou're invited to speak. This time, you don't give a grand speech. Instead, you tell your story simply: the pilgrimage, the return for your father's sword, the discovery of betrayal, the journey to Rome, kneeling naked before the Pope. You describe the True Cross and Santiago's bone not as tools but as sacred charges that humble you daily.\n\nThe response is profound. Several merchants pledge major donations on the spot. Lorenzo Medina, a shipping magnate: 8,000 florins. The Wool Guild of Barcelona: provisions for 500 men for two months. Three minor noble families pledge smaller amounts totaling 5,000 florins.\n\nBut the evening's surprise comes from an unexpected source.\n\nAugust 22 Evening: Meeting Isabel\n\nDuring the dinner, María introduces you to several merchant families. Among them: Rodrigo Ruiz, a wealthy cloth merchant, his wife Juana, and their daughter Isabel.\n\nThe moment you see her, something shifts.\n\nIsabel is seventeen, with unusual auburn hair that catches the lamplight, pale skin with a dusting of freckles, and bright green eyes that seem to see straight through pretense. She wears a fine but modest gown in deep blue. When she curtsies, there's something both proper and slightly awkward about it - like she's learned the forms but isn't entirely comfortable with them.\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" she says in clear Castilian with a Barcelona accent. \"My father has told me about your speech in Florence. He was there on business and heard you.\" She glances at her father, then back to you. \"He came home changed. He couldn't stop talking about the white banner and the cross and... and you.\"\n\nRodrigo Ruiz steps forward, a successful merchant perhaps forty-five years old, well-dressed but not ostentatious. \"Your Majesty, my family converted to Christianity three generations ago. We've worked hard to prove our faith, our loyalty, our place in Christian society.\"\n\nHis voice grows passionate. \"When I heard your speech in Florence - when you spoke about Christian virtue, about protecting even Muslims who surrender, about mercy and justice - I thought: this is what true Christianity means. Not just declaring faith, but living it.\"\n\nHe produces a letter of credit. \"Twenty thousand florins, Your Majesty. Half now, half when the crusade begins its march. This is everything my family can contribute. We want to be part of something holy.\"\n\nYou're stunned by the amount, but you find your eyes drawn back to Isabel. She's watching you with an intensity that's both disconcerting and compelling. Not the awed devotion of Pietro or the reverent distance of others - something more direct, more questioning.\n\n\"My father is generous,\" she says quietly. \"But Your Majesty, may I ask - do you truly mean what you said? About protecting Muslims who convert or surrender? About mercy?\" There's challenge in her voice, carefully delivered but real. \"Because many crusaders have said such things before, and then...\"\n\n\"Isabel,\" her mother says sharply, clearly mortified.\n\nBut you find yourself respecting the question. \"Yes,\" you say simply. \"I mean it. I've sworn it before God and before the True Cross itself. My crusaders take vows to uphold those principles.\"\n\nIsabel studies your face for a long moment, those green eyes searching. Then she nods slowly. \"I believe you,\" she says softly. \"I don't know why, but I do.\"\n\nThe conversation continues, but you're distracted. Isabel says little more - her parents do most of the talking - but you're intensely aware of her presence. The way she listens carefully to everyone. The slight furrow in her brow when something troubles her. How her eyes sometimes meet yours and then dart away.\n\nWhen the Ruiz family departs, she curtsies again. \"God bless your crusade, Your Majesty. I'll pray for your success.\" Simple words, but delivered with sincerity that makes them feel weighty.\n\nAfter they leave, María appears at your elbow. She's noticed something. Your sister knows you too well.\n\n\"The Ruiz family is converso,\" she says quietly. \"Very wealthy, very devout, but always proving themselves. Isabel is... unusual. Educated - her father paid for private tutors. She reads Latin, knows theology better than most priests. She questions everything.\" María pauses. \"Some find her difficult. Too bold, too questioning for a woman of her station.\"\n\nYou realize you're still watching the door where Isabel departed.\n\nMaría touches your arm gently. \"Hermano, be careful. She's a merchant's daughter, and converso besides. Any... attachment would be complicated.\"\n\nYou nod, not trusting yourself to speak. But Isabel's face stays in your mind.\n\nDays Four-Five: August 23-24 - Momentum Builds\n\nThe cathedral displays continue. Crowds remain large. By now, everyone in Barcelona and the surrounding countryside knows about the True Cross and Santiago's bone being displayed in their cathedral.\n\nDonations accelerate:\n\nAugust 23: 12,000 florins from various noble families and merchants\n\nAugust 24: 8,000 florins, including a surprising donation from the Barcelona Jewish community (500 florins with a note: \"For the protection of all peoples of the Book\")\n\nCrusader recruitment:\n\nAugust 23: Forty-one apply. After assessment, twelve presented, you accept nine.\n\nAugust 24: Fifty-three apply (word is spreading to countryside). After assessment, fifteen presented, you accept twelve.\n\nYour crusader company now numbers thirty-nine men beyond your original guards. Rodrigo organizes them into formations, begins serious training. García and Sir Thomas work daily with groups, teaching sword work, pike drill, horsemanship. Marco proves excellent as a training sergeant - he knows how to teach soldiers efficiently.\n\nFray Hernando is tireless. Daily confession sessions, group instruction in crusading principles, theological discussions. He's building exactly what you asked for - a spiritual culture within your forming army.\n\nOn August 24 evening, something unexpected happens. The Archbishop of Zaragoza requests private audience with you. In María's chambers, with only her present as witness, he speaks bluntly:\n\n\"Your Majesty, I've spent four days watching this. Watching you. Watching the people's response.\" He leans forward. \"The Consell Reial meets in two days. I will tell them that Aragon should support your crusade. Not with troops immediately - that requires more political negotiation. But with safe passage, with provisions, with tacit blessing.\"\n\nHe pauses. \"More than that - I will write to King Alfonso in Naples. I will tell him what I've witnessed. That you carry papal authority that cannot be questioned. That you've shown leadership, piety, and strategic thinking. That opposing you would mean opposing Rome.\"\n\nHis eyes are shrewd. \"I cannot promise what Alfonso will do. He's focused on Naples, and his brothers have his ear. But my word carries weight. This helps you, Your Majesty.\"\n\nYou realize this is the political breakthrough you needed in Aragon. The Archbishop of Zaragoza publicly supporting your crusade legitimizes it throughout Alfonso's realm.\n\nDays Six-Seven: August 25-27 - Major Commitments\n\nAugust 25: The Archbishop addresses the Consell Reial. Though you're not present (you're not a member), María hears everything afterward.\n\nThe Archbishop described your papal commission, the relics you carry, the crowds' genuine devotion, your careful screening of crusaders. He argued that Aragon should view your crusade as Spain's crusade, not just Castile's. That Granada threatens all Christian kingdoms. That opposing or hindering papal authority would be dangerous spiritually and politically.\n\nThe result: The Consell votes to:\n\nGrant you safe passage through Aragonese territory\n\nAllow recruitment in Aragon (those who join do so voluntarily)\n\nProvide favorable terms for supplies and provisions\n\nSend formal letter to Alfonso recommending he support the crusade\n\nNot everything you might want, but substantial progress.\n\nAugust 26: Three major Catalan noble families - the Montcadas, the Cervelló, and the Cardona - pledge formal support:\n\nCombined 15,000 florins in donations\n\nAgreement to allow their vassals to join crusade if they choose\n\nFuture military support to be negotiated (carefully worded to not commit fully yet)\n\nPere de Cardona, the Royal Chamberlain, requests private audience. \"Your Majesty, my family has watched you carefully. You're not what the Infantes described. My daughter Catalina...\" He pauses. \"She's one of Queen María's ladies. She's been attending the cathedral displays. She's been moved by what she's seen. She's asked if she might speak with you briefly.\"\n\nYou agree, curious. Catalina proves to be an intelligent, elegant woman of twenty who asks perceptive questions about your crusade's conduct, your commitment to mercy, how you'll maintain discipline. She's clearly assessing whether her family's support is wise. The conversation is professional, respectful, but you find yourself comparing her unfavorably to Isabel - Catalina is polished where Isabel is genuine, practiced where Isabel is spontaneous.\n\nAugust 27: Final day of the major display (though smaller displays will continue). The cathedral is packed for morning Mass. The Archbishop of Zaragoza preaches, speaking about divine providence, God's will made manifest, the call to holy service.\n\nAfter Mass, you address the assembled crowd yourself. Not a grand speech - a simple statement:\n\n\"I am Juan, King of Castile, servant of God, bearer of His holy relics. I march to Granada not for glory but for obedience. Not for conquest but for conversion. Join me if you feel called. Support with prayers and donations if you cannot come in person. And know that every act of service - great or small - is seen by God.\"\n\nThe response is overwhelming. People rush forward to pledge themselves, to donate, to touch the barriers near the relics. Your guards maintain order, but the fervor is palpable.\n\nFinal tallies for the week:\n\nDonations:\n\nNobles and major merchants: 68,000 florins\n\nCommon people and smaller sources: 14,000 florins\n\nTotal: 82,000 florins (more than four times annual Castilian royal revenue)\n\nCrusader Recruits:\n\nApplications: 248 men\n\nAfter assessment: 73 presented to you\n\nAccepted: 58 (plus your original 4, total 62 crusaders beyond your core guards)\n\nQuality Assessment (Rodrigo's report):\n\n12 are experienced soldiers or minor knights\n\n31 are competent fighters with basic training\n\n15 are raw but promising (like Andrea)\n\nAll have passed Fray Hernando's spiritual screening\n\nPolitical Achievements:\n\nArchbishop of Zaragoza actively supporting\n\nConsell Reial granted safe passage and support\n\nThree major Catalan families pledged backing\n\nLetter going to Alfonso V recommending support\n\nYour reputation in Aragon transformed from \"unstable young king\" to \"blessed crusader\"\n\nAugust 27 Evening: Private Moment\n\nAfter the exhausting day, you find yourself in María's private chambers. Your sister pours wine, and you sit together as family rather than king and queen.\n\n\"You've done something extraordinary, hermano,\" she says softly. \"In one week, you've accomplished what most kings couldn't do in months. Barcelona is yours. The Archbishop supports you. Even those who came skeptical have been won over.\"\n\nShe pauses, then adds with a slight smile: \"And you've attracted attention beyond just political support. Catalina de Cardona asked her father if a match might be considered. She's a good woman - educated, poised, politically valuable.\"\n\nYou nod absently, but your mind drifts to auburn hair and green eyes that ask difficult questions.\n\nMaría notices. She always notices. \"Or perhaps your thoughts lie elsewhere? With a certain merchant's daughter, maybe?\"\n\nYou look at her sharply. She shrugs. \"I saw how you looked at Isabel Ruiz at the dinner. And how she looked at you. And hermano...\" Her voice grows more serious. \"I understand. She's unusual, intelligent, genuine. But she's a converso merchant's daughter. Any relationship beyond friendship would be... extremely complicated politically.\"\n\nShe squeezes your hand. \"I'm not saying it's impossible. I'm saying be careful. You're doing so well. Don't let your heart create problems your crown doesn't need.\"\n\nYou know she's right. But you also know that Isabel's face won't leave your thoughts.\n\nStatus at End of Week (August 27, 1430)\n\nLocation: Barcelona\n\nResources:\n\n82,000 florins in new donations (plus previous papal and Florence funds)\n\nSupplies and provisions pledged\n\nLetters of credit across Mediterranean\n\nMilitary:\n\n62 sworn crusaders (beyond core guard company)\n\nTraining ongoing under Rodrigo, García, Sir Thomas, and Marco\n\nArmor and equipment being procured\n\nPolitical:\n\nArchbishop of Zaragoza supporting\n\nAragonese safe passage granted\n\nMajor Catalan families pledged support\n\nYour reputation in Aragon dramatically improved\n\nLetter en route to Alfonso V in Naples\n\nPersonal:\n\nCaptain Fernán riding to Castile with arrest orders (should arrive early September)\n\nDeveloping feelings for Isabel Ruiz (complicated)\n\nSister María facilitating and supporting\n\nFray Hernando building spiritual culture in crusader company\n\nChallenges Ahead:\n\nMust decide sea vs. land route to Seville\n\nNeed intelligence on Granada's naval strength\n\nCaptain Fernán's mission may trigger civil war\n\nIsabel presents personal complication\n\nTime advancing toward November 8 Royal Council\n\nNext Decisions:\nYou've accomplished more than expected in Barcelona. Do you:\n\nStay longer to consolidate gains?\n\nBegin planning departure for Seville?\n\nAddress the Isabel situation somehow?\n\nFocus on other matters?\n\nWhat do you want to do?",

      "text": "María is 33, married for 15 years without children, isolated in Barcelona while her husband chases Italian ambitions. She's lonely but also politically sophisticated. She understands the complications but also might sympathize with her younger brother's first real romantic feelings.\n\nShe needs to:\n1. Acknowledge his feelings seriously (not dismiss them as youthful infatuation)\n2. Point out the complications clearly\n3. Perhaps find a middle path that allows some connection without immediate scandal\n4. Be sisterly - caring, protective, but also honest\n\nThe tone should be intimate, familial, with María both concerned and perhaps a bit knowing. She was 18 once too, though her marriage was arranged when she was even younger.\n\nMaría looks up from the letter she's been reading. You're in her private chambers - just the two of you, no attendants, no formality. When she sees your face, her expression softens immediately.\n\n\"Oh, hermano,\" she says gently, setting down the letter. She gestures for you to sit beside her on the cushioned bench near the window. \"Come. Sit with me.\"\n\nWhen you do, she takes your hand between both of hers - not as queen to king, but as older sister to younger brother.\n\n\"You're thinking about her,\" she says. Not a question. \"You haven't stopped thinking about her since the dinner three days ago.\"\n\nShe studies your face with eyes that have known loneliness and complicated feelings.\n\n\"Juan, I can arrange for Isabel to visit. Easily. I could invite her mother and her for tea, or ask Isabel to join my ladies for an afternoon. The Ruiz family would be honored by the invitation. Isabel would come.\" She pauses. \"But before I do, I need you to understand what you're walking into.\"\n\nShe shifts to face you more directly, her voice gentle but serious.\n\n\"Isabel is seventeen - only a year younger than you. She's intelligent, educated, genuine. I can see why you're drawn to her. She's not like the practiced court ladies who've been trained to flatter and flirt. She's real. She questions things. She sees you, not just your crown.\"\n\nMaría squeezes your hand.\n\n\"But hermano, she's a converso. Her grandfather was born Jewish, converted to save his family. There are people - many people - who will never see past that. Who will whisper that her family's Christianity is false, that they're secretly practicing Jewish rites, that they can never be truly Spanish or truly Christian.\"\n\nHer voice grows more urgent.\n\n\"And she's a merchant's daughter. Not nobility. If you... if anything developed between you, it would be seen as completely inappropriate. Kings marry for alliances, for political advantage, for bloodlines. They don't marry merchants' daughters, especially not converso merchants' daughters.\"\n\nShe releases one of your hands to touch your face gently.\n\n\"I'm not telling you not to feel what you feel. Feelings don't obey politics or propriety. God knows I understand that.\" There's something in her voice - old pain, perhaps, from her own arranged marriage at eighteen to a man who's now abandoned her for Italian dreams. \"I'm telling you that if you pursue this - even just spending time with her - you must be very, very careful.\"\n\nShe sits back slightly, thinking.\n\n\"Here's what I can do. I can invite Isabel and her mother for tea tomorrow afternoon. Casual, informal, with several of my other ladies present. You could... happen to visit me during that time. Completely innocent. We talk, we laugh, you get to know her better in a safe setting. Nothing scandalous, nothing that creates gossip.\"\n\nHer expression grows more calculating, not unkindly.\n\n\"Or, if you want something more direct - I could invite just Isabel, with the excuse that I'm curious about her education, want to meet this unusual young woman everyone's talking about. You could be present for part of that conversation. More private, but also more obvious what you're doing.\"\n\nShe searches your eyes.\n\n\"But Juan, you need to think about what you want from this. Is it just... wanting to see her again? To talk with someone who sees you as a person rather than a king? That I understand completely. Or is it something more? Because if it's more, if you're developing real feelings...\"\n\nShe doesn't finish the sentence, but her meaning is clear. Real feelings lead to impossible situations.\n\n\"Tell me what you're feeling, hermano. Not as your sister the queen who worries about politics. As María, who loves you and wants you to be happy. What is it about Isabel that won't leave your thoughts?\"\n\nShe waits, holding your hand, her expression open and caring. In this moment, she's not a queen managing Alfonso's court in his absence. She's your sister, offering guidance and understanding about matters of the heart.\n\nWhat do you tell her?",

I understand wanting someone to see you, to want you, not your crown or your political value.\"\n\nShe comes back to sit beside you, taking both your hands again.\n\n\"But hermano, there's a difference between what you're describing and what I think is actually happening to you.\" Her voice grows more serious. \"Kings taking mistresses - that's one thing. It's understood, it's discreet, it's usually with women who know the arrangement and accept it. A lady of the court, a widow, someone appropriate who understands this is physical pleasure, not love.\"\n\nShe searches your face.\n\n\"But Isabel... Juan, when you talk about her, you don't sound like a man who just wants to bed a pretty girl. You sound like someone who's falling in love. You said 'I am in love with her and want her' - love first, want second. That's not the same as desire alone.\"\n\nShe squeezes your hands.\n\n\"If this were just... physical need, just the desires of a young man who's been traveling for months focused on holy purpose and hasn't had any release - I could arrange something discreet. There are ways. Women who would be honored, who would be discreet, who understand these things. No one would judge you for that. Even Father Hernando would understand, even if he'd counsel against it.\"\n\nHer expression grows more intense.\n\n\"But Isabel is dangerous precisely because she's not that. She's a respectable merchant's daughter, converso, who would be ruined if you... if you pursued her and then walked away. If you just want her body, you'd be destroying her reputation, her marriage prospects, her family's standing - all for a few nights of pleasure. That's not just sinful, Juan, it's cruel.\"\n\nShe pauses, then continues more gently:\n\n\"And if you truly love her - if this is your heart, not just your body - then you're in even more dangerous territory. Because love makes people do foolish things. Love makes kings marry inappropriate women and tear their kingdoms apart. Love makes people ignore political reality and follow their hearts off a cliff.\"\n\nMaría wipes her eyes again.\n\n\"So I need you to tell me true, hermano. When you think about Isabel, what do you actually want? Do you want to bed her? Do you want her as a mistress? Do you want to court her properly? Do you imagine... God help us, do you imagine marrying her?\"\n\nShe looks at you with desperate concern.\n\n\"Because each of those is a different path with different consequences. If it's just desire - just youth and loneliness and attraction - we can address that safely. If it's real love... then we need to talk about what that would actually mean for you, for her, for your crusade, for everything you've built.\"\n\nShe touches your face gently.\n\n\"I'm not judging you, Juan. I'm trying to understand so I can help you. So tell me - when you imagine seeing Isabel again tomorrow, what do you imagine? What do you want to happen?\"\n\nHer eyes are kind but searching, waiting for you to be truly honest about what you're feeling.\n\nWhat do you tell her?",

      "text": "Juan is describing classic symptoms of infatuation - can't stop thinking about her, wants to see her, wants physical closeness (kissing, holding), wondering if it's love. This is very age-appropriate for an 18-year-old, especially one who's been focused on duty and religious purpose.\n\nMaría should be:\n1. Compassionate and understanding - not dismissive of his feelings\n2. Honest about what this might be (infatuation vs. deep love)\n3. Realistic about the complications\n4. Helpful in a way that protects both Juan and Isabel\n5. Perhaps sharing some of her own experience to help him understand\n\nShe should probably:\n- Acknowledge this sounds like it could be love, or at least the beginning of it\n- Explain that first love is powerful and real, even if it's new\n- Warn about the difference between the excitement of attraction and the depth of real love that develops over time\n- Help him understand that wanting to kiss and hold someone is normal and not inherently wrong\n- But also make clear that acting on those desires with Isabel specifically would have serious consequences\n- Offer to arrange a meeting where he can at least talk with her safely\n\nThis is a tender moment between siblings. María herself is lonely and understands longing, so she'll be empathetic.\n\nMaría's expression melts completely. She pulls you into an embrace, holding you tightly like she did when you were small and she was leaving for Barcelona all those years ago.\n\n\"Oh, hermano,\" she whispers. \"My sweet, earnest little brother.\"\n\nShe pulls back to look at your face, her hands on your shoulders, tears streaming down her cheeks but smiling through them.\n\n\"Yes, Juan. That sounds like love. Or at least the beginning of it.\" She touches your cheek tenderly. \"The not being able to stop thinking about her, wanting to arrange your whole life around the possibility of seeing her, imagining holding her and kissing her - that's what it feels like when your heart is caught.\"\n\nShe sits back down, pulling you with her, still holding your hands.\n\n\"I felt that way once, you know. Before I married Alfonso. There was a young knight at court in Valladolid - I was sixteen, he was nineteen. I thought about him constantly. Wondered where he'd be, tried to be where he was. Imagined what it would be like if he held my hand, if he kissed me.\" She smiles sadly. \"Then Father arranged my marriage to Alfonso for the alliance with Aragon, and I never saw that knight again. I don't even know if he felt anything for me, or if it was all just my young heart inventing romance.\"\n\nShe wipes her eyes.\n\n\"But Juan, here's what I've learned about love. What you're feeling right now - this overwhelming attraction, this obsession, this desire - that's real. It's powerful. It's intoxicating. But it's also...\" She searches for words. \"It's the spark, not the fire. It's how love begins, but it's not yet what love becomes.\"\n\nShe squeezes your hands.\n\n\"Real love - the kind that sustains a lifetime - requires knowing someone. Their flaws, their fears, their ordinary moments. The way they are when they're tired or angry or sick. Whether their character matches their appearance. Whether your hearts align beyond just attraction.\"\n\nHer voice grows more gentle.\n\n\"You've met Isabel once. You had a brief conversation at a dinner. You saw her intelligence, her genuineness, the way she looks at you. That's enough to catch your heart - clearly it has. But hermano, you don't know her yet. You don't know if this spark could become a fire, or if it would burn out once you knew each other better.\"\n\nShe pauses, then continues:\n\n\"And the desire you feel - wanting to kiss her, hold her - that's not wrong, Juan. That's not sinful in itself. That's how God made us. Men and women are meant to desire each other. Father Hernando would tell you to resist temptation, and he's right about that. But feeling the temptation? That's just being human. Being eighteen. Being alive.\"\n\nMaría's expression grows more serious.\n\n\"But here's the complication, and this is important: Isabel is not someone you can simply pursue for pleasure and then walk away from. She's a respectable young woman. If you... if you were alone with her, if you kissed her, if anything more happened - and people found out - she would be ruined. Her reputation destroyed. Her marriage prospects gone. Her family shamed.\"\n\nShe looks at you intently.\n\n\"Even if people didn't find out, you would have taken something from her that she can't get back - her innocence, her reputation in her own eyes, her ability to go to her eventual husband as a maiden. That has consequences for her whole life.\"\n\nShe softens again.\n\n\"So what I can do for you, hermano, is this: I will invite Isabel and her mother tomorrow afternoon for tea with several of my ladies. You can visit during that time - completely proper, nothing scandalous. You can talk with her. Get to know her better. See if this feeling is just the overwhelming attraction of a moment, or if there's something deeper there.\"\n\nShe tilts her head thoughtfully.\n\n\"And perhaps... if the afternoon goes well, if I see that she might feel something for you too... I could arrange for you to have a few moments of more private conversation. Not alone - that would be inappropriate and dangerous for her reputation. But perhaps a walk in the palace gardens with me and her mother nearby but out of earshot. Something where you could actually talk, really talk, and begin to know each other.\"\n\nHer voice drops to barely a whisper.\n\n\"But Juan, you must promise me - you must swear to me - that you will not try to kiss her or hold her unless you are prepared to make this something real. Something public. Something that acknowledges her as more than a passing desire. Because if you treat her as someone to secretly romance and then set aside, I will never forgive you. And you would deserve the guilt that would haunt you.\"\n\nShe searches your eyes.\n\n\"Can you promise me that? That you'll be careful with her heart, not just your own?\"\n\nShe pauses, then adds more softly:\n\n\"And hermano... you should also think about what this means for you. If you truly fall in love with Isabel, if she falls in love with you, what then? You're a king. You have a crusade to lead. You need political alliances. A marriage to a converso merchant's daughter would create enormous complications. I'm not saying it's impossible - love has toppled kingdoms and rewritten rules before. But you need to count that cost before you let your heart run away with you.\"\n\nShe cups your face in both hands.\n\n\"Tomorrow afternoon. I'll arrange it. You'll see her again. You can talk with her. And maybe we'll learn if this is the beginning of something real, or just the beautiful, painful ache of young attraction that will pass with time.\"\n\nShe kisses your forehead.\n\n\"Either way, I'm here. I'll help you navigate this. I promise.\"\n\nWhat do you say to your sister?",

      "text": "María laughs - actually laughs - a warm, genuine sound you haven't heard from her in days. She covers her mouth with her hand, her eyes dancing with affection and amusement.\n\n\"Oh my God, hermano. You sound like you're fourteen years old preparing for your first dance at court.\" She's still smiling, wiping tears from her eyes, but this time they're tears of laughter mixed with tenderness. \"The King of Castile, blessed crusader who knelt naked before the Pope, commander of armies, asking his sister what to wear and what her favorite food is.\"\n\nShe pulls you into another embrace, laughing against your shoulder.\n\n\"This is wonderful. This is perfect. You're so...\" She pulls back to look at your face. \"You're so young and earnest and normal right now. Not the king carrying the True Cross. Just Juan, my little brother, nervous about seeing a girl he likes.\"\n\nShe composes herself somewhat, though she's still grinning.\n\n\"Alright, alright. Let me help you. Let's think through this properly.\"\n\nShe stands and begins pacing, her practical side engaging.\n\n\"What to wear:\"\n\n\"Not your white crusader garments. Those are for public displays, for religious moments. If you wear those, you're the blessed crusader, the untouchable holy king. You want her to see you.\" She considers. \"Something fine but not ostentatious. Your dark blue doublet with the silver threading - it's handsome, well-made, but not overwhelming. It makes you look...\" She smiles slightly. \"It makes you look like a young nobleman, not a crusading saint or a political force. Just a young man of quality.\"\n\nShe pauses. \"And for God's sake, make sure your hair is properly washed and combed. You've been training with the crusaders every morning - you can't show up smelling like horses and sweat.\"\n\n\"A gift:\"\n\nMaría's expression grows more thoughtful here.\n\n\"This is delicate. Too expensive or ostentatious a gift would be inappropriate - it would look like you're trying to buy her affection or flaunt your wealth. Too trivial would be insulting. And anything romantic - jewelry, personal items - would be completely improper at this stage.\"\n\nShe thinks for a moment.\n\n\"Books. Isabel is educated, her father paid for tutors. She reads Latin. A book would show you noticed something real about her, not just her appearance. Something theological perhaps, since you spoke about Christian virtue and she clearly cares about faith. Or...\" Her eyes light up. \"Poetry. Courtly poetry. Something about virtue and honor and... well, something that could be interpreted as appropriate either way.\"\n\nShe moves to a shelf and pulls down a small volume.\n\n\"This. Cancionero - a collection of Castilian poetry. Beautiful verses, properly bound, valuable but not extravagant. You could say you thought she might enjoy it given her education. Completely appropriate gift from a king to an intelligent young woman, but...\" She smiles knowingly. \"If she's clever - and she is - she'll understand that poetry is the language of courtship.\"\n\n\"Her favorite food:\"\n\nMaría laughs again. \"Hermano, I have no idea what her favorite food is. I met her at the same dinner you did - three days ago. I know she's educated and converso and questions everything, but I don't know if she prefers almond cakes or honey pastries.\"\n\nShe sits back down beside you.\n\n\"But here's what I can do. Tomorrow, I'll serve a variety of things at tea. Sweet cakes, fruit, honey pastries, some savory options. I'll watch what she reaches for, what she enjoys. And if the afternoon goes well, if I see that this might become something more than one meeting... I'll find out her preferences. Discreetly.\"\n\nHer expression becomes more serious, though still warm.\n\n\"But Juan, I need you to manage your expectations. Tomorrow afternoon, you'll see her. You'll talk with her. That's all. Don't imagine anything more dramatic happening. Don't build up fantasies of private moments or declarations of feeling. Just... see if you can have a real conversation. See if the attraction you feel is matched by any genuine connection.\"\n\nShe takes your hand again.\n\n\"And remember - she's seventeen, unmarried, from a respectable family. She'll be chaperoned by her mother and surrounded by my ladies. She cannot be forward or bold even if she wanted to be. You'll have to read subtle signs - how she looks at you, whether she engages in conversation beyond politeness, if she seems interested in seeing you again.\"\n\nShe squeezes your hand.\n\n\"Women of Isabel's station are trained from childhood to be modest, demure, appropriate. Even if she feels something for you - and we don't know that she does - she won't be able to show it openly. You'll have to be patient. Observant. Careful.\"\n\nMaría stands and pulls you to your feet.\n\n\"Now, it's late. You should sleep. Tomorrow morning, have your servants prepare your blue doublet. Wash thoroughly - and I mean thoroughly. I'll have the poetry book wrapped appropriately. The tea will be at the second hour after noon. You'll 'happen' to visit me perhaps a quarter hour after the ladies arrive - long enough that it's not too obvious, but not so long that you miss most of the afternoon.\"\n\nShe walks you toward the door, then stops and turns back.\n\n\"Juan... one more thing. When you see her tomorrow, try to actually listen to what she says, not just gaze at her adoringly like a lovesick puppy.\" She's smiling but serious. \"Ask her questions. About her education, her thoughts on theology, what books she's read, what she thinks about things. Get to know her mind, not just her face.\"\n\nShe touches your cheek gently.\n\n\"Because if this is going to be real - if it's going to be more than just infatuation - you need to know who she actually is. And she needs to know you. Not the crusader king, but Juan. The young man who questions his own certainty, who struggles with faith and pride, who cares deeply about doing right. Show her that person.\"\n\nShe kisses your forehead.\n\n\"Now go. Rest. Dream of auburn hair and green eyes if you must. But tomorrow, be present. Be genuine. Be yourself.\"\n\nShe opens the door, then calls after you as you leave:\n\n\"And hermano? Try not to look too eager when you arrive. A little dignity, please. You're still a king.\"\n\nBut she's smiling as she says it.\n\nThe night passes. Morning comes. You have the day until the afternoon tea.\n\nWhat do you do to prepare? And when the time comes, how do you want to approach the meeting?",

      "text": "The Afternoon Tea - August 28, 1430\n\nThe afternoon is warm and pleasant. María has arranged the gathering in her private garden chamber - a beautiful room that opens onto a small courtyard with flowering plants and a fountain. The sound of water trickling provides gentle background music.\n\nYou've spent the morning in an agony of preparation. Your servants were bemused by your insistence on washing thoroughly, combing your hair multiple times, adjusting your doublet. Fray Hernando noticed your nervous energy during morning prayers and gave you a knowing look but said nothing. Rodrigo mentioned you seemed \"distracted\" when reviewing the crusaders' training reports.\n\nNow, at the appointed time, you stand outside María's chamber with the wrapped poetry book in your hands. Your heart pounds. You've faced down hostile nobles, knelt naked before the Pope, proclaimed crusade before thousands - but this feels more terrifying somehow.\n\nYou wait. A quarter hour, as María instructed. It feels like an eternity.\n\nFinally, you knock and enter.\n\nThe scene that greets you is one of elegant femininity. Six women sit in a loose circle on cushioned chairs around a low table laden with refreshments - honey cakes, almond pastries, fresh fruit, delicate cups of spiced wine and herbal tea.\n\nMaría sees you first and stands with perfect theatrical surprise. \"Your Majesty! How delightful. I wasn't expecting you this afternoon.\" Her eyes dance with barely suppressed amusement at the obvious fiction.\n\nThe other women rise and curtsy as one. Your eyes find Isabel immediately.\n\nShe's wearing a gown of deep green that makes her auburn hair seem to catch fire in the afternoon light streaming through the windows. Her pale skin shows a faint blush - whether from the warmth of the afternoon or your entrance, you can't tell. Those green eyes widen slightly when she sees you, and something flickers across her face too quickly to read.\n\nJuana Ruiz, Isabel's mother, is perhaps forty, handsome rather than beautiful, with shrewd eyes that assess you carefully. She curtsies deeply. \"Your Majesty. What an honor.\"\n\nThe other ladies are three of María's regular companions - you recognize them vaguely from court but their names escape you in your current state of nervous focus.\n\n\"Please, ladies, sit,\" you say, trying to sound casual. \"I don't wish to interrupt. I was merely...\" You flounder slightly. What's your excuse for being here?\n\nMaría saves you smoothly. \"His Majesty has been so focused on the crusade preparations, I insisted he take an afternoon to rest. I thought he might enjoy some civilized company after all those soldiers and training grounds.\" She gestures to an empty chair near her own - which happens to be positioned where you'll be able to see Isabel easily. \"Please, join us, hermano. We're just discussing poetry, actually.\"\n\nYou sit, hyperaware of Isabel's presence across the small circle. She's looking at her hands folded in her lap, the picture of modest propriety, but you catch her glancing up at you once, quickly, before looking away again.\n\nOne of María's ladies - a woman named Leonor - speaks up. \"Her Majesty was just telling us about some Castilian poets. Lady Isabel was mentioning she's read some Latin poetry.\"\n\nIsabel speaks for the first time, her voice soft but clear. \"Just a little, my lady. My tutor thought I should understand the classics. Though I confess I find the meaning sometimes escapes me.\" She glances at you again, briefly. \"The language is beautiful even when I don't fully grasp the intent.\"\n\nYou realize you're staring and force yourself to look away, accepting a cup of wine from a servant.\n\nMaría, bless her, creates an opening. \"His Majesty has an excellent education in such matters. Juan, didn't you study under that Dominican scholar in Salamanca for a time?\"\n\nYou clear your throat. \"Yes, Brother Alfonso. He was... very thorough.\" You look at Isabel. \"What poets have you read, Lady Isabel?\"\n\nShe meets your eyes now, just for a moment, and you see something there - nervousness matching your own, perhaps? \"Ovid, mostly, Your Majesty. The Metamorphoses. Stories of transformation, gods becoming mortals, mortals becoming something else entirely.\" A slight pause. \"I found it fascinating how easily the boundaries between different states of being could be crossed in those stories.\"\n\nIs there meaning in that choice? You're not sure.\n\n\"And what did your tutor say about the moral lessons?\" you ask, genuinely curious now, trying to follow María's advice to listen and ask questions.\n\nIsabel's face becomes more animated. \"That's what I found most interesting, Your Majesty. My tutor - Father García, a very learned Franciscan - said the pagan poets were actually expressing Christian truths without knowing it. That transformation and change were always possible through grace, even if they used the language of mythology.\"\n\nHer mother Juana interjects gently: \"Isabel has always been curious about such matters. Perhaps too curious sometimes.\" But she's smiling fondly.\n\nYou find yourself leaning forward. \"I don't think one can be too curious about truth, Lady Juana. Even when it appears in unexpected forms.\"\n\nIsabel's eyes light up at this. \"Exactly! That's what I've always thought. Truth is truth, wherever you find it.\" Then she catches herself, as if remembering she's supposed to be demure. \"Though of course, the clearest truth is in Scripture and Church teaching.\"\n\nThe conversation flows from there, but you're barely aware of the other women. You and Isabel keep returning to each other, finding points of connection. She mentions reading about the lives of saints, and you tell her about your favorite - Saint Martin of Tours, who cut his cloak in half for a beggar. She asks if that's who you're named after, and you admit you don't know, you've never asked.\n\nAn hour passes. The light shifts in the garden courtyard outside. You've almost forgotten to be nervous.\n\nThen María stands. \"Ladies, shall we take a turn in the garden? The fountain is particularly lovely this time of day, and I want to show you the roses that just bloomed.\"\n\nThe women rise. You stand as well, and as the group begins moving toward the courtyard, you catch María's eye. She gives you the tiniest nod, then deliberately engages Juana Ruiz in conversation, drawing her toward the far side of the garden where the roses grow.\n\nThe other ladies drift away as well, admiring flowers, examining the fountain's stonework. It's all perfectly innocent - everyone is still visible to everyone else. But suddenly you and Isabel are standing near each other with no one immediately beside you, the noise of the fountain covering quiet conversation.\n\nYour heart hammers. You remember the book in your hand - you've been holding it the entire time like a fool.\n\n\"Lady Isabel,\" you say quietly. \"I... I brought something. For you.\" You hold out the wrapped volume. \"Your father mentioned your education, and you spoke about poetry. I thought... I thought you might enjoy this.\"\n\nShe looks at the book, then up at you, those green eyes wide with surprise. \"Your Majesty, I couldn't possibly—\"\n\n\"Please,\" you say. \"It's just a book. A collection of Castilian poetry. Nothing...\" You fumble for words. \"Nothing inappropriate. Just something I thought an educated woman might appreciate.\"\n\nShe takes it carefully, unwrapping it enough to see the binding. Her fingers trace the leather cover reverently. \"It's beautiful,\" she whispers. Then she looks up at you, and for just a moment, her modest mask slips. You see genuine feeling there - gratitude, confusion, something deeper she's not sure how to name.\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" she says quietly, barely audible over the fountain. \"Why are you doing this?\"\n\n\"Doing what?\" Your mouth is dry.\n\n\"This.\" She gestures helplessly at the book, at the garden, at the situation. \"Being here. Bringing me gifts. I'm just... I'm a merchant's daughter. You're...\" She can't finish.\n\nYou step slightly closer, not touching, just close enough that no one else could hear. \"I wanted to see you again,\" you say simply, honestly. \"Since the dinner, I haven't been able to stop thinking about—\" You stop yourself. Too much, too fast. \"About our conversation. About what you said about mercy and justice and truth.\"\n\nShe's blushing deeply now. \"Your Majesty, I...\" She looks down at the book. \"I don't know what to say.\"\n\n\"Say you'll keep the book,\" you murmur. \"Say I can...\" What? You don't even know what you're asking for. \"Say I can see you again. To talk. About poetry or theology or... anything.\"\n\nIsabel is silent for a long moment, her face a mixture of emotions you can't quite read. Finally, very quietly: \"Your Majesty, I'm not...\" She struggles. \"I'm not someone you should be interested in. My family is converso. People whisper about us. And I'm not noble, I'm not...\"\n\n\"I don't care about that,\" you say, and you realize it's true. In this moment, you genuinely don't care about the political complications.\n\nShe looks up at you, and there are tears in her eyes now. \"But you should care, Your Majesty. You're a king. You have a crusade to lead. I'm...\" Her voice drops to barely a whisper. \"I'm nobody. And if people see you paying attention to me, they'll say terrible things. About both of us.\"\n\nBefore you can respond, María's voice calls from the roses: \"Your Majesty! Come see these blooms, they're extraordinary!\"\n\nThe moment shatters. Isabel steps back quickly, clutching the book to her chest. She curtsies deeply, her face averted. \"Thank you for the gift, Your Majesty. It's... it's very generous.\"\n\nWhen she looks up again, the modest mask is back in place, but her eyes are still wet.\n\nThe tea concludes shortly after. The ladies depart, chaperoned and proper. Juana Ruiz thanks María profusely for the invitation. Isabel curtsies to you again, murmurs \"Your Majesty,\" and then she's gone, the book wrapped carefully in cloth under her arm.\n\nWhen everyone has left, María takes your arm and walks you back to her chambers.\n\n\"Well?\" she asks quietly. \"How do you feel?\"\n\nWhat do you say to your sister? And what do you make of Isabel's reaction?",

      "text": "Oh no, Juan is misinterpreting Isabel's response. This is a classic case of a young person (he's 18) not understanding the complexities of the situation. Isabel clearly has feelings for him - the tears, the emotion, the way she looked at him - but she's also being realistic and protecting both of them from scandal.\n\nMaría needs to provide the older sister wisdom here. She needs to explain that:\n1. Isabel's reaction shows she DOES have feelings - if she didn't care, she would have just accepted the gift politely and moved on\n2. Isabel is being protective of Juan and herself by pointing out the complications\n3. This is actually a sign of maturity and genuine care, not rejection\n4. The tears, the emotional response - these show she's affected by him\n\nMaría should be gentle but firm here. She shouldn't let Juan spiral into self-pity or give up too easily. She should help him understand what just happened from a woman's perspective, especially a woman in Isabel's complicated position.\n\nThis is also a teaching moment about how women in this era have to navigate very carefully - they can't just express their feelings openly, especially not to a king. Isabel has to protect her reputation, her family's reputation, and also genuinely cares about not damaging Juan's political position.\n\nMaría should probably also point out that Juan is being somewhat dramatic and self-pitying here, which is very 18-year-old of him.\n\nMaría stops walking and turns to face you, gripping both your arms firmly. Her expression is somewhere between exasperation and affection.\n\n\"Juan. Stop. Listen to me.\"\n\nShe pulls you to sit on a bench in the corridor, then sits beside you, not letting go of your arm.\n\n\"Hermano, you are being dramatic and blind and very, very eighteen years old right now.\" Her voice is gentle but firm. \"Did you see the same thing I just saw?\"\n\nYou start to protest, but she holds up a hand.\n\n\"That girl - that young woman - was in tears, Juan. Tears. Not because she doesn't want you. Because she does, and it terrifies her.\"\n\nShe squeezes your arm.\n\n\"If Isabel didn't care about you, if she felt nothing, do you know what she would have done? She would have accepted your gift with a polite smile, thanked you prettily, made appropriate small talk, and forgotten about you the moment she left. That's what women do when a man they're not interested in pays attention to them.\"\n\nMaría's voice grows more intense.\n\n\"But that's not what happened. She got emotional. She tried to push you away. She told you all the reasons why you shouldn't be interested in her - she's converso, she's nobody, people will say terrible things. Juan, do you understand what that means?\"\n\nShe turns your face to look at her.\n\n\"It means she's already thinking about what a relationship with you would mean. She's already imagining it, worrying about it, trying to protect you - and herself - from the consequences. Women don't do that about men they don't care about. They only do that when they're already feeling something and trying to be sensible about it.\"\n\nShe releases your face but keeps hold of your hand.\n\n\"And the tears, hermano. She had tears in her eyes. That's not indifference. That's someone who wants something she thinks she can't have. That's someone who's already feeling more than she should and is trying to be responsible about it.\"\n\nMaría stands and pulls you up with her, walking you back toward her chambers.\n\n\"Let me explain something about women in Isabel's position - and honestly, about women in general in our world. We can't just... say what we feel. Not directly. Especially not to a king. Especially not when we're from families that are already watched and judged.\"\n\nShe continues as you walk:\n\n\"Isabel knows - because she's intelligent and has been raised to understand these things - that if she shows interest in you, if she encourages your attention, she risks everything. Her reputation could be destroyed by gossip. Her family could be accused of social climbing or using her to manipulate you. People would say terrible things - that she seduced you, that her family planned it, that they're trying to marry above their station.\"\n\nYou enter her chambers and she pours wine for both of you.\n\n\"And more than that, Juan - I think she genuinely cares about you. About your crusade, your reputation, your political position. When she said 'you're a king, you have a crusade to lead, you shouldn't be interested in me' - that wasn't rejection. That was her trying to protect you from making a mistake she thinks would hurt you.\"\n\nShe hands you the wine.\n\n\"That's what love looks like, hermano. Not just wanting someone, but caring about their wellbeing enough to push them away if you think you'll damage them.\"\n\nShe sits beside you.\n\n\"So no, she didn't say 'I want you too, let's pursue this openly.' Because she can't say that. Society doesn't let her. Her position doesn't allow it. And her genuine care for you and her family makes her try to be sensible even when her heart is pulling her toward you.\"\n\nMaría's expression softens completely.\n\n\"Juan, you're not a fool. You saw something real between you. The conversation flowed naturally, she lit up when talking with you, you connected on ideas and thoughts. That was genuine. And her emotional reaction afterward? That was genuine too. She's feeling something, and it scares her because of all the complications.\"\n\nShe pauses, then adds:\n\n\"The question isn't whether she wants you. I think she does, or at least she's beginning to. The question is: what do you do about it? Because she's right about the complications. They're real. This would be difficult, potentially scandalous, politically complicated.\"\n\nShe looks at you seriously.\n\n\"So you need to decide. Was this just... wanting to see her again because you were infatuated? If so, then yes, let it go. It would be kinder to her to not pursue something you're not serious about. But if this is something more - if you felt a real connection, if you think this might be the beginning of actual love - then you don't give up after one difficult conversation.\"\n\nShe squeezes your hand.\n\n\"Real courtship, real love - it's not easy, Juan. It's not like the romances where the knight and the lady fall into each other's arms. It's complicated and requires patience and navigating obstacles. And sometimes it requires showing someone that you're serious, that you're willing to work through the complications, that they're worth it to you.\"\n\nShe tilts her head.\n\n\"So tell me true - now that you've spent time with her, now that you've talked and seen her reaction - what do you actually feel? Was it just attraction that's now disappointed? Or is it something more?\"\n\nShe waits, watching your face carefully.\n\nWhat do you tell your sister?",

      "text": "María needs to respond to this in a nuanced way. She should:\n1. Acknowledge the nobility of his reasoning\n2. But also challenge some of his assumptions\n3. Present the full complexity of the situation\n4. Perhaps share her own experience with duty vs. heart\n5. Not push him either way, but help him think it through completely\n\nShe might point out:\n- Kings do marry for love sometimes, even when politically inconvenient\n- His father had arrangements beyond his marriage\n- The question of what kind of king/man he wants to be\n- Whether his \"purpose\" is really so clear-cut\n- The cost of always putting duty first (she knows this personally)\n- But also acknowledge the validity of his concerns\n\nThis is a crossroads moment. María should be wise, loving, and honest - not pushing him toward Isabel, but making sure he's thought through all the implications of walking away too.\n\nMaría is silent for a long moment. She sets down her wine, stands, and walks to the window. When she speaks, her voice is quiet and carries the weight of years of experience you don't have yet.\n\n\"You sound so certain. So resolved.\" She doesn't turn around. \"You've decided that duty must override everything else. That your purpose - uniting Spain, serving God - is more important than love. That you must marry strategically or not at all.\"\n\nShe finally turns to face you, and there are tears on her cheeks.\n\n\"Do you know what I hear when you say that, hermano? I hear myself fifteen years ago. When Father told me I would marry Alfonso of Aragon for the alliance. When I stood in a room not unlike this one and told myself that duty was more important than the young knight I'd been dreaming about. That a princess doesn't marry for love. That my purpose was to serve my family and my kingdom.\"\n\nShe comes back to sit beside you.\n\n\"And you know what? I was right. I did my duty. I married Alfonso. I helped secure the alliance between Castile and Aragon. I've been a good queen. I've fulfilled my purpose.\" Her voice breaks slightly. \"And I've been alone for ten years while my husband chases Italian dreams. I've spent a decade in a loveless marriage, childless, useful only as a symbol. I did the right thing, the dutiful thing.\"\n\nShe wipes her eyes.\n\n\"I'm not saying I regret it. I made my choice and I live with it. But Juan, when you say 'better to cut it all off sooner and save her pain' - whose pain are you really trying to save? Hers? Or yours?\"\n\nShe takes your hand.\n\n\"Because here's what I've learned, hermano. Duty is real. Purpose is real. But so is the cost of always choosing duty over heart. You can be the perfect king - strategic, calculating, marrying for alliances, never letting personal feelings complicate your mission. But you'll also be...\" She gestures at herself. \"This. Alone. Going through the motions. Remembering what might have been.\"\n\nShe squeezes your hand hard.\n\n\"Now, let me be clear - I'm not saying you're wrong. The complications with Isabel are real. A converso merchant's daughter is not a strategic marriage. Your nobles would resist. Some would be scandalized. It could create real political problems at a time when you need unity for your crusade.\"\n\nHer voice grows more intense.\n\n\"But Juan, you're also making assumptions that might not be true. You say you 'already know' that purpose is more powerful than anything, even love. Do you? Have you actually tested that? Or are you afraid to find out?\"\n\nShe leans closer.\n\n\"And you say you must marry strategically. Must you? Your father married for alliance, yes, but he also had deep affection for your mother. Some kings marry for pure strategy. Others marry where heart and duty align. A few even marry for love despite complications, and make it work.\"\n\nShe pauses.\n\n\"You're eighteen years old, Juan. You have years before you need to marry. The crusade will take a decade or more. You don't have to decide right now between Isabel and strategic marriage. You could... see where this goes. Carefully. Slowly. Maybe it burns out on its own. Maybe you discover she's not who you imagined. Maybe the complications prove insurmountable.\"\n\nHer expression softens.\n\n\"Or maybe - and I'm just saying maybe - you find that this is real, and deep, and worth fighting for. And maybe when that time comes, you'll have to choose. But why make that choice now, before you even know what you're choosing between?\"\n\nShe releases your hand and sits back.\n\n\"You say 'if we can never marry, we can never love each other.' But hermano, that's not how hearts work. Love doesn't wait for permission. It doesn't check political calculations first. You already love her - you said so yourself. Cutting her off now doesn't erase that. It just means you both suffer the loss without ever knowing if it could have been something real.\"\n\nMaría's voice drops to barely a whisper.\n\n\"And there's one more thing you need to consider. You talk about your purpose - uniting Spain, serving God, leading the crusade. That's beautiful. That's noble. But Juan...\" She looks at you with devastating honesty. \"What kind of king do you want to be? The kind who always puts duty first and becomes hard and calculating? Or the kind who fights to find a way to honor both duty and heart? The kind who shows mercy even when it's inconvenient?\"\n\nShe touches your face gently.\n\n\"Because you told Isabel at that dinner - you promised in your crusading oaths - that you would show mercy, protect the vulnerable, fight for justice even when it's difficult. But if you can't show that same mercy and courage in your own life... if you won't fight for what matters to you personally... how will you have the strength to enforce those principles in your army?\"\n\nShe pulls back.\n\n\"I'm not telling you what to do, Juan. This is your life, your heart, your kingdom. If you genuinely believe that walking away now is the right choice - that it serves her better and serves your mission better - then do it. Make that choice with clear eyes.\"\n\nHer voice becomes firmer.\n\n\"But don't fool yourself that it's selfless. Don't tell yourself you're 'saving her pain' when you're also saving yourself from having to navigate something difficult. Don't convince yourself that duty demands you cut this off when really you're just afraid - afraid of the complications, afraid of what your nobles will say, afraid of having to fight for something that doesn't fit neatly into your plans.\"\n\nShe stands and walks to her desk, pulls out a piece of parchment.\n\n\"I'll tell you what I think you should do. Not what you must do - what I think would be wise.\"\n\nShe turns back to you.\n\n\"Send her a letter. Through me, so it's properly chaperoned. A simple letter thanking her for the conversation, saying you valued meeting someone who thinks deeply about faith and truth. Nothing romantic. Nothing inappropriate. Just... keeping the door open. Being honest that you enjoyed speaking with her and would welcome the chance to do so again.\"\n\nShe holds up the parchment.\n\n\"And then you wait. You focus on your crusade preparation. You finish your business in Barcelona. You return to Seville for your Royal Council. You have months of work ahead before you need to make any decisions about marriage or love or any of this.\"\n\nHer expression softens.\n\n\"But don't slam the door shut today out of fear or duty or noble self-sacrifice. Give this time. Give yourself permission to feel what you feel. Give her the same. And see what happens. Maybe in a few months you'll realize it was just infatuation and you're glad you didn't pursue it. Maybe you'll meet someone else and Isabel will become a sweet memory. Or maybe...\"\n\nShe doesn't finish, but her meaning is clear.\n\n\"What do you think, hermano? Are you truly certain you want to cut this off now? Or are you afraid, and calling that fear duty?\"\n\nShe waits, holding the parchment, watching you with eyes full of love and concern.\n\nWhat do you decide?",

Perhaps frustrated that he won't listen\n\nBut she's also his sister and she loves him. She'll arrange what he asks even if she disagrees.\n\nThis is Juan choosing duty/purpose over love, but in a way that might actually be more hurtful - he's going to tell Isabel everything rather than just quietly letting it fade. That's either very honest and respectful, or potentially cruel depending on how it's handled.\n\nFray Hernando being present is interesting - Juan wants spiritual authority there, perhaps to help him stay strong, or perhaps to validate his choice as the right one.\n\nMaría's response should show her hurt, her worry, but also her recognition that when Juan is in this state, he cannot be moved.\n\nMaría stands very still, the parchment hanging forgotten in her hand. For a long moment she just looks at you, and you see a dozen emotions cross her face - hurt, worry, frustration, resignation, and beneath it all, love mixed with something that might be fear.\n\nWhen she speaks, her voice is carefully controlled, but you can hear the pain underneath.\n\n\"I see.\" She sets the parchment down slowly. \"You're right. We have been apart a long time. I remember a little boy who left for pilgrimage, and a king returned.

From the letters, from the reports. When you feel called to something and nothing can sway you. When you stripped naked before the Pope. When you ordered the Infantes arrested despite all advice against it. And now this.\"\n\nShe turns slightly, enough to see your profile.\n\n\"Fray Hernando warns you about this certainty. About the danger of confusing your will with God's will. But you don't believe you're doing that, do you? You believe this IS right. That cutting Isabel off, telling her 'everything,' making this sacrifice - that this is what God's purpose demands.\"\n\nHer voice breaks slightly.\n\n\"And maybe you're right. Maybe I'm the fool, thinking that love and duty can coexist. Maybe I'm projecting my own regrets onto you. Maybe your certainty IS divine guidance and I'm too wounded by my own choices to see it.\"\n\nShe comes back to face you, and her eyes are wet but her expression is composed.\n\n\"I will arrange it. Tomorrow at the eleventh hour. Isabel and her mother, you, me, and Father Hernando. A private audience.\" She pauses. \"Though I warn you, hermano - if you're going to tell that girl you love her and then tell her you can never be together because duty demands it... that's not kindness. That's not mercy. That's giving her a wound that will take years to heal.\"\n\nShe touches your arm gently.\n\n\"But I understand. Your mind is made up. Nothing I say will change it. So I'll do what you ask, because I'm your sister and I love you, even when I think you're making a terrible mistake.\"\n\nShe walks you to the door, then stops you with a hand on your shoulder.\n\n\"Juan... I have one request. Just one. When you're there tomorrow, before you speak to Isabel - look at Father Hernando. Really look at him. See if he approves of what you're about to do. See if his face shows that this is God's will, or if he looks troubled.\"\n\nHer voice drops to a whisper.\n\n\"Because if even your confessor - who warns you about worldly temptation and counsels purity - looks uncomfortable with what you're doing... maybe that should tell you something.\"\n\nShe kisses your forehead.\n\n\"Sleep well, hermano. I'll send word to the Ruiz family first thing in the morning. They'll be honored by the royal summons, even if they don't yet know what it means.\"\n\nShe opens the door for you.\n\n\"And Juan? I pray you're right. I pray this certainty of yours IS God's will, and not just a young king too afraid to fight for something that doesn't fit neatly into his plans. Because if you're wrong...\"\n\nShe doesn't finish. She just closes the door quietly behind you.\n\nYou're alone in the corridor. The evening is settling over Barcelona. Tomorrow at the eleventh hour, you'll tell Isabel everything - that you love her, and that you can never be with her.\n\nThe certainty you felt when you told María fills you still. This is right. This is necessary. Sacrifice for the greater purpose.\n\nBut as you walk back to your chambers, you can't quite shake María's words: \"That's giving her a wound that will take years to heal.\"\n\nThe night passes. Morning comes.\n\nWhat do you do to prepare for the meeting? And when the time arrives, how do you want to approach this conversation?",

This is significant - he's turning to his spiritual advisor after making this decision about Isabel. Let me think about where Fray Hernando would be and how he would respond.\n\nFray Hernando has been extremely busy with the crusader recruitment - hearing confessions, providing spiritual guidance, building the spiritual culture Juan asked for. He's likely exhausted but would always make time for Juan.\n\nJuan is coming to him with certainty - he's made up his mind to end things with Isabel before they truly begin. But María specifically suggested Juan look at Fray Hernando's reaction tomorrow to see if he approves. This is interesting - even María, who might normally expect the confessor to counsel against romance, suspects Fray Hernando might be troubled by Juan's approach.\n\nFray Hernando has consistently warned Juan about:\n1. Confusing his own will with God's will\n2. Certainty becoming pride\n3. Using spiritual language to justify calculated decisions\n4. The danger of treating everything as if it has divine sanction\n\nBut he's also shown himself to be surprisingly understanding of human complexity. He was moved by Juan's offering before the Pope. He's not a harsh moralist - he's someone who genuinely cares about Juan's spiritual wellbeing.\n\nHow would Fray Hernando respond to Juan saying he's decided to tell Isabel he loves her but can never be with her because duty demands it?\n\nI think Fray Hernando would be troubled. Not because he wants Juan to pursue romance over duty - but because:\n1. The certainty again - Juan is \"absolutely certain\" this is God's will\n2. The cruelty of the approach - telling someone you love them just to say you can't be with them\n3. The potential spiritual pride in making a grand gesture of sacrifice\n4. The question of whether this is really about protecting Isabel or protecting Juan from difficulty\n\nFray Hernando would probably probe gently, ask questions, try to understand Juan's reasoning, and express concerns without directly ordering Juan to do differently.\n\nYou find Fray Hernando in the small chapel attached to the palace. It's late evening, and he's alone, kneeling before the altar. Several candles burn, casting flickering shadows across the stone walls. He's still wearing his habit from the day - no doubt he's been hearing confessions and counseling the new crusaders since morning.\n\nHe doesn't turn when you enter, but after a moment he crosses himself, rises from his knees with the slight stiffness of a man who's been kneeling too long, and turns to face you.\n\n\"Your Majesty.\" His weathered face shows exhaustion, but his eyes are alert, kind. \"Of course. Always.\"\n\nHe gestures to a bench along the wall, and you both sit. The chapel is quiet except for the faint sound of wind outside and the occasional pop of candle wax.\n\n\"You look troubled,\" he says gently. \"What weighs on you?\"\n\nThe candles flicker, casting moving shadows across his face. He waits patiently, hands folded in his lap, giving you his complete attention despite his obvious weariness.\n\nWhat do you tell him?",

He'll answer the question but also gently push Juan toward what he really wants to discuss.\n\nFray Hernando's expression softens with both gratitude and gentle amusement. He recognizes deflection when he sees it, but he answers your question earnestly.\n\n\"I'm managing, Your Majesty. Tired, yes. But it's good work.

This situation seems like exactly the kind of thing Hernando would be deeply troubled by. Let me think about what Hernando would say:\n\n1. He would recognize this isn't confession - Juan is telling him about a plan, not confessing sins\n2. He would be troubled by Juan's absolute certainty that this is \"God's plan\"\n3. He would question whether telling Isabel \"I love you but we can never be together\" is actually merciful or cruel\n4. He would challenge Juan's framing of this as avoiding sin/temptation\n5. He would probably be quite direct - he's never been afraid to challenge Juan\n6. He might even refuse to participate in this meeting\n\nThis feels like a moment where Hernando needs to push back hard. Juan is using religious language to justify what might actually be emotional avoidance or fear. The friar would see through this.\n\nFray Hernando sits very still as you speak. His expression doesn't change, but something in his eyes shifts - concern deepening into something more serious. When you finish, he's silent for a long moment, staring at the candles on the altar.\n\nFinally, he speaks, his voice quiet but unusually firm.\n\n\"No.\"\n\nJust that one word, flat and definitive.

But I'm going to speak to you anyway, as your confessor and as someone who cares about your soul.\"\n\nHe stands and paces a few steps, then turns back.\n\n\"What you're planning to do tomorrow - telling that young woman that you love her but can never be with her - that's not sacrifice, Juan. That's not serving God's purpose. That's cruelty dressed up in pious language.\"\n\nHis voice is harder than you've ever heard it.\n\n\"You say you don't want to hurt her, but you're going to tell her you love her and then reject her? In front of her mother, your sister, and me? You're going to wound her deeply, publicly, and call it duty?\" He shakes his head. \"That's not mercy. That's not Christian virtue. That's you wanting to feel noble about breaking someone's heart.\"\n\nHe comes back to sit beside you, his voice dropping but losing none of its intensity.\n\n\"And this language you're using - 'God's plan,' 'my purpose,' 'must be done' - Juan, we've talked about this. How do you know this is God's will? Have you prayed about it? Have you asked God what He wants? Or have you decided what you want to do and then convinced yourself it's what God wants?\"\n\nFray Hernando leans closer.\n\n\"You say you must avoid temptations and sins. What temptations? What sins? Falling in love isn't a sin, Juan. Being attracted to a woman isn't a sin. Even desiring her isn't inherently sinful - that's how God made us. The sin comes when we use people, when we lie, when we let desire override virtue.\"\n\nHe gestures emphatically.\n\n\"You're not proposing to seduce her and abandon her. You're not planning to use her for pleasure and cast her aside. You're feeling genuine love - which you've admitted to yourself and to me. And now you're planning to reject that love because... why? Because she's converso? Because she's not politically useful? Because loving her would be complicated?\"\n\nHis voice grows softer but more penetrating.\n\n\"Those are valid concerns, Juan. The political complications are real. But don't call them 'God's purpose.' Don't pretend you're making a sacrifice for holiness when what you're really doing is avoiding something difficult and calling it duty.\"\n\nHe pauses, then continues more gently:\n\n\"Do you remember what you told me when we first spoke about discernment? You asked how to distinguish God's will from your own desires. I told you that true divine guidance leads to humility, charity, peace - even when the path is hard. It serves others' good, not just your own comfort.\"\n\nHe meets your eyes.\n\n\"So tell me - this plan of yours to tell Isabel you love her then reject her - does that lead to humility? Does it serve her good? Does it bring peace?\" He shakes his head slowly. \"Or does it let you feel noble while avoiding having to fight for something complicated? Does it protect you from risk while wounding her?\"\n\nFray Hernando stands and walks back to the altar, then turns.\n\n\"You want my participation tomorrow. You want me there as your confessor, to give this decision spiritual weight. But I won't do it, Juan. I won't stand there and watch you hurt that young woman and pretend it's God's will.\"\n\nHis voice becomes almost pleading.\n\n\"If you genuinely believe you cannot marry her - if you truly think the political complications are insurmountable - then don't tell her you love her. Don't arrange a formal meeting. Just... let it fade. Be polite but distant. Let her think it was a brief moment that passed. That would be kinder.\"\n\nHe walks back toward you.\n\n\"Or, if you must address this directly, tell her the truth: 'I'm attracted to you, I care about you, but the complications are too great and I'm not brave enough or committed enough to fight through them.' That's honest. That's real. But don't tell her you love her and frame rejecting her as holy sacrifice.\"\n\nHe sits back down beside you, his voice dropping to barely above a whisper.\n\n\"Juan, I've watched you do extraordinary things. I've seen you kneel naked before the Pope. I've seen you inspire thousands. I've watched you build something beautiful with this crusade. But this?\" He gestures helplessly. \"This looks like fear. Fear dressed up as purpose. And I won't bless it with my presence.\"\n\nHe takes your hand gently.\n\n\"You came here and said 'we need to talk.' So talk to me. Not about what you've decided, but about what you're feeling. Not about God's purpose, but about your heart. Tell me - setting aside politics and duty and crusades - what do you actually want?\"\n\nHis eyes are kind but unyielding, waiting.\n\n\"Because until you can be honest about that, you can't possibly know if you're following God's will or just running away from something that scares you.\"\n\nThe candles flicker in the silence that follows. Fray Hernando waits.\n\nWhat do you say to him?",

He's clarifying that he's NOT claiming this is God's will - just his own sense of purpose. And now he's actually asking for guidance instead of just informing.\n\nThis is good - he's being more open. Fray Hernando should respond to this opening. He should:\n1. Acknowledge the clarification about not claiming God's will\n2. Address the actual question: how to proceed with this meeting\n3. Offer real pastoral guidance, not just criticism\n4. Help Juan think through his options more clearly\n\nFray Hernando would be relieved that Juan is at least asking for counsel now rather than just declaring his decision. He'd want to help Juan find a path that doesn't wound Isabel unnecessarily.\n\nFray Hernando exhales slowly, and some of the tension leaves his shoulders. He squeezes your hand once before releasing it.\n\n\"Thank you. For that clarification.\" His voice is gentler now. \"You're right - you didn't claim it was God's will. I apologize for putting those words in your mouth. You said it was your purpose, your certainty. That's different.\"\n\nHe sits back, thinking carefully.\n\n\"Alright. So you've fallen in love with someone you've decided not to pursue. You've already arranged a meeting with her and her mother, your sister present. And you're asking me how to proceed.\"\n\nHe rubs his weathered face with both hands, then looks at you.\n\n\"First question: Why did you arrange this meeting? What did you intend to accomplish when you set it up?\"\n\nHe holds up a hand.\n\n\"I'm not being rhetorical. I genuinely need to understand what you were thinking. Because how you should proceed depends on what outcome you were hoping for. Were you planning to tell her you love her and can't be with her? Were you planning to formally end something that barely began? Were you hoping for... something else?\"\n\nHis eyes are searching but not judgmental now.\n\n\"Because Juan, here's the truth: you have several options for how to proceed, and each has different consequences. But I can't advise you on which path to take until I understand what you actually want to achieve.\"\n\nHe leans forward.\n\n\"Do you want to be honest with her about your feelings? Do you want to protect her from false hope? Do you want to explain why you can't pursue this? Do you want... closure for yourself? What's driving this meeting?\"\n\nHe waits, genuinely listening now rather than lecturing.\n\n\"Tell me what you hoped would happen tomorrow.

      "text": "Juan is expressing something quite profound here, and quite young. He's imagining that he can transfer his earthly love to some kind of spiritual/heavenly realm where it can exist purely, safely, eternally. This is... complicated. It's both beautiful and potentially naive, and possibly a way to avoid dealing with the reality of his feelings.\n\nFray Hernando would recognize this as the kind of spiritual idealization that young people do - trying to make earthly desires \"holy\" by projecting them into heaven. It's not necessarily wrong, but it could be a way of avoiding the harder questions.\n\nThe confessor asked one question and Juan responded - good. Now Fray Hernando should respond to what Juan actually said, not ask more questions. He should engage with this idea of transferring earthly love to \"God's kingdom.\"\n\nFray Hernando would likely be:\n1. Moved by the sincerity and beauty of Juan's vision\n2. Concerned about the practicality and whether this is avoidance\n3. Worried about what telling Isabel this would actually do to her\n4. Wanting to help Juan think through whether this is truly kind\n\nHe shouldn't lecture, but should engage genuinely with what Juan is saying.\n\nFray Hernando is silent for a long moment, his expression shifting through several emotions - surprise, tenderness, concern, and finally something like sadness mixed with understanding.\n\n\"I apologize. You're right. I do that - ask too many questions at once.\" He takes a breath. \"Let me respond to what you've said.\"\n\nHe stands and walks a few paces, his hands clasped behind his back, thinking. When he turns back, his voice is gentle.\n\n\"What you just described - this vision of love existing purely in God's kingdom, safe and everlasting - that's beautiful, Juan. It's the kind of thing mystics write about. Saints have wrestled with similar ideas. The love that transcends earthly limitations, that becomes something spiritual and eternal.\"\n\nHe comes back to sit beside you.\n\n\"And I understand the impulse. If you can't have something in this fallen world, you imagine it perfected in the next. That's not wrong in itself.\" He pauses. \"But Juan, I need you to think about what you're planning to tell Isabel tomorrow.\"\n\nHis voice becomes more serious.\n\n\"You're imagining telling her: 'I love you, but we cannot be together in this world. Instead, I'll keep that love safe in my vision of God's kingdom, where it can be pure and eternal. I hope you can do the same.'\"\n\nHe looks at you intently.\n\n\"Do you understand what that would sound like to her? To a seventeen-year-old woman who just met you, who's feeling something she didn't expect, who's already frightened by the complications?\"\n\nHe spreads his hands.\n\n\"It would sound like you're asking her to... what? To love you spiritually but not physically? To keep her feelings for you locked away as some kind of holy offering? To live her life knowing that the King of Castile loves her in some abstract, heavenly way, but won't actually be with her?\"\n\nHis voice grows firmer.\n\n\"That's not honesty, Juan. That's not opening your heart like a good Christian. That's giving her an impossible burden. You're asking her to carry the weight of your love for her entire life, knowing it can never be real, telling her to somehow make it 'safe and pure' in some spiritual realm.\"\n\nHe leans closer.\n\n\"And more than that - it's selfish. You get to keep your feelings, nurture them in your private vision of God's kingdom, feel noble about it. But she has to live with the knowledge that you love her, that you could pursue her but won't, and that somehow she's supposed to transform that into something 'everlasting' while living a normal life. Maybe marrying someone else. Maybe never marrying because you've made her love you.\"\n\nFray Hernando's expression softens with compassion.\n\n\"I know you don't intend cruelty. I know you're trying to be honest, trying to honor what you feel. But Juan - sometimes honesty without wisdom is just selfishness. Sometimes the kind thing is not to share everything you're feeling.\"\n\nHe sits back.\n\n\"You dream of God's kingdom where your love for Isabel can exist purely. That's your spiritual journey, your inner life. But dragging her into that dream, making her complicit in it, asking her to somehow share in this abstract eternal love while you both live separate earthly lives?\"\n\nHe shakes his head.\n\n\"That's not fair to her. That's asking her to be part of your spiritual fantasy while denying her any real relationship. And calling it 'honesty' doesn't make it kind.\"\n\nHe looks at you with deep seriousness.\n\n\"So here's what I think you need to decide, Juan. Not five questions - just one:\n\nIs this meeting tomorrow actually for her benefit, or is it for yours?\"\n\nHe lets that sit for a moment.\n\n\"Are you doing this so she understands the situation and can move forward with her life? Or are you doing this so you can feel like you were honest, so you can have closure, so you can declare your love and feel noble about sacrificing it?\"\n\nHis voice is gentle but unyielding.\n\n\"Because if it's for you - if this is about your need to be honest, your vision of eternal love, your feelings - then you're using her. You're making her carry the weight of your emotions so you can feel better about not pursuing her.\"\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\"But if it's truly for her - if you genuinely want to spare her false hope and help her move forward - then you don't need this meeting at all. You simply... step back. Be polite but distant. Let the moment pass. Let her think it was a brief connection that didn't develop. That would be far kinder.\"\n\nFray Hernando stands.\n\n\"So which is it, Juan? What's this meeting really about?\"\n\nHe waits, watching you in the candlelight.\n\nWhat do you say?",

Give practical, kind advice\n5. Be the spiritual guide Juan needs\n\nThe question is what SHOULD Juan do? Let me think:\n- Meeting is arranged for tomorrow at 11am\n- Isabel and her mother think it's just a royal audience\n- They don't know what Juan plans to say\n- If Juan cancels it completely, it might seem strange but not catastrophic\n- If Juan goes through with it but handles it differently, that could work too\n\nFray Hernando would probably suggest:\n1. Either cancel it (simple, clean, lets things fade naturally)\n2. Or go through with it but keep it light and appropriate - just a brief audience thanking the family for their support, nothing dramatic\n\nThe key is Fray Hernando should help Juan see that he doesn't need grand gestures or dramatic declarations. Sometimes the loving thing is to just... let it be.\n\nFray Hernando's face transforms. The tension, the concern, the weariness - it all melts away, replaced by something that looks like profound relief mixed with deep affection. He sits back down beside you and places both hands on your shoulders.\n\n\"Juan.\" His voice is thick with emotion. \"Do you know how rare it is - how truly extraordinary - for someone to say 'I was wrong' about something they felt absolute certainty about just an hour ago?\"\n\nHe pulls you into a brief, tight embrace, then releases you to look at your face.\n\n\"Most people, especially kings, would rather destroy themselves and everyone around them than admit uncertainty. But you just did. You questioned your own certainty. That's not weakness, hermano. That's wisdom. That's grace.\"\n\nHe wipes his eyes quickly.\n\n\"And yes - cancel the meeting. Absolutely. Go to María tonight, tell her it's cancelled. She'll understand. She'll be relieved, honestly. She was already troubled by what you were planning.\"\n\nHe leans back, thinking through the practics.\n\n\"Tomorrow morning, María can send a message to the Ruiz family. Something simple and appropriate: 'The King sends his apologies, but urgent crusade business has arisen and he must cancel tomorrow's audience. He hopes to have the pleasure of seeing the family at future court functions.' Polite, respectful, nothing dramatic. They'll be disappointed but not suspicious.\"\n\nHe looks at you seriously.\n\n\"And then, Juan, you let it fade naturally. You don't arrange another meeting. You don't send letters. If you happen to see Isabel at some future court event - which you might, her father is a substantial merchant - you're polite, appropriate, friendly even. But distant. You let time pass. You let the intensity of these feelings settle.\"\n\nHis voice becomes gentler.\n\n\"What you're feeling right now - this overwhelming love, this sense that you can't stop thinking about her - that's real. I'm not dismissing it. But it's also partly the intensity of first attraction, of something new and exciting and forbidden. It feels all-consuming because it is, in this moment.\"\n\nHe takes your hand.\n\n\"But feelings change, Juan. They evolve. What feels unbearable today might feel manageable in a month. What seems like eternal love today might become a fond memory in a year. Or...\" He pauses. \"It might deepen into something real and lasting. But you can't know that after one meeting and one gift of poetry.\"\n\nHe squeezes your hand.\n\n\"So give yourself time. Give her time. Focus on your crusade preparation. The Royal Council in Seville is in two months. You have enormous work ahead - managing the Infantes, presenting the crusade bull, organizing your forces. You don't need this complication right now.\"\n\nHis expression becomes thoughtful.\n\n\"And Juan... maybe someday, if the feelings persist, if you keep thinking about her months from now, if you realize this isn't just infatuation - maybe then you can reassess. Maybe then you can decide if she's worth fighting for despite the complications. But that decision doesn't have to be made tonight or tomorrow. You have time.\"\n\nHe releases your hand and sits back.\n\n\"As for your vision of keeping love safe in God's kingdom - keep that for yourself, if it helps you. Pray about it, meditate on it, offer it to God. But don't share it with Isabel. That's between you and God. Let her move forward with her life without carrying the weight of your spiritual imaginings.\"\n\nFray Hernando stands and offers you his hand to help you up.\n\n\"Go to María now. Tell her the meeting is cancelled. Tell her you realized it wasn't the right approach. She'll help you compose the message to the Ruiz family.\" He smiles slightly. \"And she'll probably hug you and tell you she's proud of you for recognizing this before you did something you'd regret.\"\n\nHe walks with you toward the chapel door, then stops and turns back.\n\n\"Juan, one more thing. You said that an hour ago you had absolute certainty, and now you're unsure about many things. That uncertainty - that willingness to question yourself - that's not a weakness to overcome. That's maturity. That's the beginning of real wisdom.\"\n\nHe places a hand on your shoulder.\n\n\"The certainty you feel sometimes - about going to Rome, about the crusade, about your purpose - maybe some of that IS divine guidance. I don't know. But maybe some of it is just... youth, passion, conviction. And learning to tell the difference - learning to question even your certainties - that's how you become not just a powerful king, but a wise one.\"\n\nHe opens the chapel door.\n\n\"Now go. Talk to your sister. Get some rest. Tomorrow, focus on your crusaders, your preparations, your real work. And let this... let Isabel and her family live their lives in peace.\"\n\nHe pauses in the doorway.\n\n\"You did well tonight, Juan. Coming here, talking through this, admitting you were wrong - that took courage. Be proud of that.\"\n\nThe chapel door stands open. The palace corridors beyond are quiet. It's late evening.\n\nWhat do you do?",

He's realized that his \"absolute certainty\" about Isabel was wrong, and now he's questioning whether his other certainties - particularly sending Captain Fernán with arrest orders for the Infantes - might also be wrong.\n\nThis is a powerful character moment. He's learning humility and self-doubt, which Fray Hernando has been trying to teach him. But it's also terrifying for him because his whole approach has been based on these moments of certainty.\n\nHe's going to María now to cancel the Isabel meeting. I should:\n1. Show him rushing through the palace\n2. Have María react to his state (he's storming in, probably looking distressed)\n3. Let him tell her about canceling the meeting\n4. Have María respond - she'll be relieved but also concerned about his state\n5. Possibly address his worry about Captain Fernán\n\nLet me write this scene with appropriate emotional weight.\n\nYou barely hear Fray Hernando call after you as you stride quickly through the palace corridors. Your heart is racing, thoughts tumbling over each other. Five times. Five moments of absolute certainty. And one of them was wrong.\n\nWhat if another was wrong too?\n\nCaptain Fernán is days into his journey now. Riding hard toward Valladolid with orders to have the Infantes arrested for treason. Orders you gave with that same unshakeable certainty you just felt about Isabel.\n\nYour footsteps echo through the corridors. A servant jumps out of your way, bowing quickly. You barely notice.\n\nYou reach María's chambers and knock hard - too hard, urgent.\n\n\"Enter!\" Her voice, surprised.\n\nYou push through the door. María is at her desk, still dressed, working on correspondence by lamplight. She looks up, startled by your entrance, and immediately stands.\n\n\"Juan? What—\"\n\n\"Cancel it.\" The words tumble out. \"The meeting tomorrow. With Isabel and her mother. Cancel it. It was a mistake. I was wrong.\"\n\nMaría's expression shifts rapidly - surprise, then concern, then understanding, then relief. She comes around the desk quickly.\n\n\"Of course. Yes. I'll send word first thing in the morning.\" She reaches for your arm. \"Hermano, sit down. You look—\"\n\n\"What if I was wrong about the Infantes too?\"\n\nThe words come out raw, almost desperate. You sink onto the bench near her desk, your legs suddenly weak.\n\nMaría goes very still. \"What?\"\n\n\"I had the same certainty. The exact same feeling.\" You look up at her, and you can feel yourself trembling. \"When I ordered Fernán to ride to Álvaro with the arrest orders. I was absolutely certain it was the right thing to do. Just like I was absolutely certain an hour ago that I needed to tell Isabel I loved her and could never be with her.\"\n\nYou put your head in your hands.\n\n\"Fray Hernando talked me out of the Isabel meeting. Made me see I was being selfish, calling it duty. That I was about to wound her for no good reason.\" Your voice cracks slightly. \"But Fernán is already gone. Days into his journey. With orders that might start a civil war. Orders I gave with the same certainty I just realized was wrong.\"\n\nMaría sits down beside you slowly, processing this. Her hand finds yours.\n\n\"Juan, breathe. Just breathe for a moment.\"\n\nYou try to steady yourself, but the thoughts won't stop racing.\n\n\"What if it's all wrong, María? What if I'm just... an eighteen-year-old boy who thinks his convictions are divine guidance but really I'm just impulsive and convinced of my own rightness? What if—\"\n\n\"Stop.\" María's voice is firm but gentle. She turns your face toward her. \"Stop spiraling. Let's think through this carefully.\"\n\nShe takes both your hands in hers.\n\n\"First - you're right that you had certainty about Isabel, and you were wrong. That's important. That's a lesson. But hermano, let's look at the other certainties on your list.\"\n\nShe counts on her fingers.\n\n\"Going to Rome - that resulted in an extraordinary papal audience, a crusade bull, the True Cross itself. That worked out remarkably well. Going back for your father's sword - you discovered the Infantes' plot to make the regency permanent. Again, good outcome. Renunciating before the Pope - moved him to tears, secured his complete backing. Those certainties proved right.\"\n\nShe squeezes your hands.\n\n\"The Isabel certainty was different. It wasn't about your mission or your crusade or your political survival. It was about your personal feelings, your heart, something you desperately wanted an answer to. Maybe those kinds of certainties - the ones about your own emotions - are less reliable than the ones about your purpose.\"\n\nYou look at her, wanting to believe this distinction matters.\n\n\"But the Infantes...\" you start.\n\nMaría's expression grows more serious. \"The Infantes. Yes. Let's think about that one carefully.\" She releases one of your hands to pour wine for both of you. \"You ordered their arrest based on reports that they rebelled, seized fortresses, tried to rally nobles against you during your absence. Is that correct?\"\n\nYou nod.\n\n\"And those reports - they came from Álvaro, yes? From your intelligence network? From reliable sources?\"\n\n\"Yes. You confirmed them yourself. You told me what happened.\"\n\nShe nods slowly. \"I did. Because it's true, Juan. They did rebel. They did try to build a coalition against you. They failed, but they attempted it. Those are facts, not feelings.\"\n\nShe hands you the wine.\n\n\"So the question isn't whether your certainty about their guilt was wrong. The question is whether arresting them - that specific action, in that specific way - was the right response.\"\n\nShe sips her wine thoughtfully.\n\n\"And honestly, hermano? I don't know. I thought it was risky when you ordered it. I still think it's risky. It might trigger exactly the civil war you're trying to prevent.\" She meets your eyes. \"But it's also possible it was necessary. That showing strength, holding traitors accountable, was the only way to establish your authority. Sometimes kings have to make dangerous moves.\"\n\nShe sets down her cup.\n\n\"The difference between the Isabel decision and the Infantes decision is this: With Isabel, Fray Hernando could show you that you were being selfish, that you were about to cause unnecessary pain for your own emotional closure. The action served no good purpose.\"\n\nShe leans forward.\n\n\"But with the Infantes - even if it's risky, even if it might go wrong - there's a real argument that traitors must face consequences. That a king who doesn't hold rebels accountable looks weak. That might be wrong, but it's not obviously selfish or cruel like the Isabel meeting would have been.\"\n\nYou feel slightly less panicked but still uncertain.\n\n\"So what do I do? Fernán is already days gone. I can't call him back.\"\n\nMaría thinks for a long moment.\n\n\"You could send another rider. Fast horses, riding even harder than Fernán. With new orders - to modify the original command. Perhaps to arrest only if certain conditions are met. Or to coordinate with Álvaro first before taking action. Or...\" She pauses. \"Or to give the Infantes a chance to surrender voluntarily before formal arrest.\"\n\nShe watches your face carefully.\n\n\"But Juan, you need to be clear about why you'd do that. Is it because you genuinely think the original order was wrong? Or is it because you're panicking after realizing you were wrong about Isabel?\"\n\nShe touches your face gently.\n\n\"There's a difference between wise reconsideration and just second-guessing yourself into paralysis. You can't function as a king if every decision you make, you immediately doubt because one decision proved wrong.\"\n\nShe sits back.\n\n\"So tell me - setting aside your panic about Isabel - do you actually think arresting the Infantes was wrong? Or do you think it was risky but potentially necessary?\"\n\nWhat do you say to your sister?",

Within a quarter hour, they arrive: Sir Thomas still in his traveling clothes, Fray Hernando looking weary but alert, and Rodrigo in his captain's sword belt, adjusting to his new authority.\n\nThey settle around the table in your chamber. A servant brings wine, then withdraws.\n\nSir Thomas speaks first, his practical English mind assessing the situation:\n\n\"Your Majesty, Barcelona has been remarkably successful. Sixty-two crusaders recruited - about half are decent fighters, the rest need more training but they're willing. Eighty thousand florins is substantial. The Archbishop's backing gives you legitimacy in Aragon.\"\n\nHe pauses, considering.\n\n\"But we're also stretched thin. Seven experienced fighters counting you, plus sixty-two recruits who aren't battle-ready yet. If we face serious trouble on the road, we're vulnerable. And every day we stay, we risk complications - political attention, the Infantes' agents watching, more time for Granada to prepare.\"\n\nRodrigo adds his perspective, speaking carefully in his new role:\n\n\"Training is going well, Your Majesty. García, Marco, Sir Thomas and I have them drilling daily. In another two weeks, maybe three, the better ones will be competent enough for real service. But right now...\" He shrugs. \"They can march, they can guard a camp, but in a real fight, they'd need heavy support.\"\n\nHe glances at a document on the table.\n\n\"Also, equipment is still being procured. We've armed about half properly. The rest have basic gear but nothing standardized. That takes time and money, even with what we have.\"\n\nFray Hernando offers the spiritual perspective:\n\n\"The men's faith is genuine, Your Majesty. I've been working with them daily - confession, instruction, building that culture you wanted. But they're still learning what it means to be crusaders rather than just soldiers. That spiritual formation takes time.\"\n\nHe leans forward.\n\n\"And there's opportunity here still. Brother Tomás, the Franciscan I mentioned - he's agreed to join us as a chaplain. I'm meeting tomorrow with the Dominican and the Benedictine. If we stay another week, I could likely recruit two or three more priests. That gives us the spiritual infrastructure we need.\"\n\nSir Thomas nods at this, then continues:\n\n\"The question of route remains, Your Majesty. Sea or land to Seville. We still don't have good intelligence about Granada's naval activity. Your sister might be able to help with that - her contacts in the Consell would know about Mediterranean shipping.\"\n\nRodrigo adds: \"And if we go by sea, hiring three ships as you suggested would take time to arrange properly. Finding captains who work together, negotiating terms, loading supplies and horses - that's at least a week of preparation.\"\n\nFray Hernando interjects: \"The Royal Council is November 8th. Today is August 28th. That's ten weeks. If we leave Barcelona in early September, we'd have six or seven weeks in Seville before the council. That's adequate time to prepare, coordinate with Don Álvaro, plan your presentation.\"\n\nSir Thomas drums his fingers on the table: \"But if we stay here three more weeks - recruiting more chaplains, training the men better, procuring all equipment properly - we'd arrive in Seville mid-to-late September with only five weeks before the council. Tighter timeline.\"\n\nThe three men look at you, waiting.\n\nWhat questions do you have for them? What's your assessment?",

The men would be competent - not veterans, but solid enough to be useful in a fight. And having everyone properly equipped means they look like an army, not a mob. That matters for morale and intimidation.\"\n\nSir Thomas nods thoughtfully: \"Three ships also means we can distribute the force - perhaps twenty men per ship plus crew. If one ship has trouble, the others can assist or at least preserve most of our strength. It's sound military thinking.\"\n\nHe pauses, considering: \"My concern is the timeline. Arriving in Seville with only five weeks before the Royal Council is tight. You'll need time to coordinate with Don Álvaro, understand the political situation there, plan your presentation of the crusade bull, potentially negotiate with nobles...\"\n\nFray Hernando interjects: \"But arriving with seventy trained crusaders, multiple chaplains, and visible strength - that makes a statement. It shows the crusade is real, organized, disciplined. That could be more valuable than extra weeks of political maneuvering.\"\n\nRodrigo adds: \"And Your Majesty, if we're traveling by sea with three ships, the journey is only about a week, maybe eight days. Much faster than overland. So the tight timeline isn't as dangerous as it might seem.\"\n\nSir Thomas strokes his beard: \"There's also the question of intelligence about Granada's fleet. Three weeks gives us time to gather better information. If we learn the sea route is genuinely dangerous, we could shift to the overland plan. Flexibility is valuable.\"\n\nHe looks at you directly: \"So yes, Your Majesty. I think this is a sound plan. Three more weeks in Barcelona for training and preparation, then three ships to Seville.

Red is often used for crusaders, but that's common. What about white and red together? White tabards with red crosses?

Perhaps a cross design, or Santiago's scallop shell, or the keys of Saint Peter since this crusade has papal authority.\"\n\nSir Thomas continues: \"If you want hundreds ready by November, we should send orders to Seville smiths or jewelers now.

The Knights Hospitaller (Order of St. John) use black mantles with white crosses. The Order of Santiago uses a red cross in the shape of a sword. So a white tabard with red cross shouldn't directly conflict, though it might evoke Templar imagery.\n\nThe war cry \"Non nobis domine\" is from Psalm 115, famously associated with the Templars. This could be problematic or could be seen as reclaiming that heritage.\n\nThe clasp design - depicting the mosque of Granada is interesting but potentially problematic. It's depicting an Islamic holy site, which might be seen as strange for Christian crusaders. The advisors should discuss this.\n\nLet me have them respond thoughtfully to each point.\n\nSir Thomas's eyebrows rise slightly: \"White tabards with red crosses... Your Majesty, that's very close to the Knights Templar's design. They wore white mantles with red crosses.\"\n\nHe pauses, seeing your expression: \"But the Templars were dissolved over a century ago. Their symbolism isn't claimed by anyone now. It might actually work in your favor - people remember the Templars as elite crusaders. Evoking that legacy could be powerful.\"\n\nFray Hernando looks thoughtful: \"And 'Non Nobis Domine' - that's from Psalm 115. 'Not unto us, O Lord, but unto Your name give glory.' It was the Templars' motto as well. You're essentially reclaiming Templar imagery for a new crusade.\"\n\nHe considers: \"That's either brilliant or dangerous. Some will see it as honoring a noble tradition. Others might worry you're trying to resurrect a dissolved order. But given your papal backing...\" He nods slowly. \"It could work. The Pope blessed you. If anyone questions it, you have that authority.\"\n\nRodrigo adds practically: \"Shields are easy. White background, red cross. Clear, visible in battle, recognizable from distance. Barcelona shield-makers can produce those. Maybe 15-20 florins per shield, so another 900-1,200 florins.\"\n\nSir Thomas returns to the clasp design: \"Iron is good - affordable, can be made in quantity. But Your Majesty...\" He hesitates. \"An image of Granada's mosque on a Christian crusader's clasp? That's... unusual. You're depicting an Islamic holy site as your symbol?\"\n\nFray Hernando frowns slightly: \"It might be seen as venerating the enemy's sacred place. Or worse, as displaying a trophy before you've earned it - counting your victories before they happen.\"\n\nRodrigo ventures: \"What about instead - an image of a Christian church, representing what the mosque will become? Or Santiago on horseback? Or the True Cross itself, since you carry it?\"\n\nSir Thomas adds: \"Or keep it simpler - just a cross with 'Granada' inscribed beneath. Clear goal, Christian symbol, nothing that could be misinterpreted.\"\n\nAll three look uncertain about the mosque image specifically, though they're clearly trying to be respectful of your vision.\n\nWhat do you think?

When he talks about serving Christ, men believe him. He's becoming a spiritual anchor for the company.\n\nTomás Garcia - day four recruit, age twenty-three. Son of a converso family like Isabel's, but he converted more deeply than his parents. Passionate about proving his faith through service. Asks theological questions, reads Scripture daily. Could perhaps assist with chaplain duties.\"\n\nFray Hernando adds: \"And I should mention Pietro from your first four. He started as an enthusiastic boy, but he's grown. He takes confession seriously, he's studying the crusading vows, he talks to the other young recruits about what it means to be a soldier of Christ. His faith is maturing.\"\n\nSir Thomas interjects: \"If I may add one more, Your Majesty - Miguel Cardona, recruited day nine. He's Pere de Cardona's nephew - minor nobility, age twenty-four. Well-trained, wealthy family. He didn't have to join, but he did anyway. That carries weight with the other noble-born recruits. And having a Cardona in the ranks strengthens your ties to that family.\"\n\nRodrigo nods: \"Those eight represent the cream of what we've recruited. Mix of skills - veteran soldiers, spiritual leaders, nobles, and determined commoners. If you want to know your company's character, they embody it.\"\n\nWhich of these men do you want to meet? All of them, or specific ones?",

Alonso Fernández - professional man-at-arms\n3. Pedro Álvarez - veteran of border skirmishes\n4. Andrea - the farm boy who's showing promise\n5. Brother Guillem - Benedictine monk who joined\n6.

Others (Andrea, Pietro, Tomás) would be more tentative.\n\nJuan will want to shape them into leaders or at least understand what makes them tick.

Pietro is barely containing excitement. Miguel Cardona, the noble, sits with careful dignity.\n\nYou take your seat at the head of the table. Your three advisors sit to your sides.\n\n\"You've been told you're the most promising of our first crusaders,\" you begin. \"My commanders and confessor have been watching you closely. You represent what this crusade can become - veterans and novices, nobles and commoners, soldiers and men of faith.\"\n\nThe men shift, some with pride, others with uncertainty.\n\n\"I've gathered you here because I need more than just soldiers. I need men who understand what we're building. Men who can help shape the others, who can carry the spirit of this crusade forward as we grow.\"\n\nYou lean forward slightly.\n\n\"So I want to hear from you. Not formal reports. Real thoughts. What have you observed in our first weeks together? What works? What concerns you? What do your fellow crusaders talk about when commanders aren't listening?\"\n\nThere's a moment of silence. The men exchange glances, uncertain who should speak first.\n\nFinally, Marco - the experienced mercenary - speaks up: \"Your Majesty, permission to be blunt?\"\n\nWhat do you say?",

They want to prove themselves worthy. Andrea's right that some worry about money, but more worry about disappointing you.\"\n\nMiguel Cardona speaks last, his noble bearing evident: \"Your Majesty, there's one more thing. Some men wonder about their status after the crusade. If we take Granada, if we survive - do we go home? Do we garrison the conquered territory? Do we become a permanent order like Santiago or Calatrava?\" He meets your eyes. \"Men want to know if this is a campaign or a lifetime commitment.\"\n\nThe eight men fall silent, having shared their observations.

So 5,000 crusaders at this wage would cost 3.6 million annually - about 12% of royal revenue.

This route offered better control and established port connections.\n\nTravel to Pisa:\n\nAugust 10-12: Uneventful journey through Tuscan countryside\n\nParty moved with practiced efficiency after months on the road\n\nCamped outside monastery near Pisa on August 11\n\nReached Pisa midday August 12\n\nHiring the Sant'Angelo (August 12-13, Pisa)\n\nCaptain Fernán and Sir Thomas surveyed available ships and selected the Sant'Angelo, a thirty-oar Pisan galley:\n\nCaptain: Luca Grimaldi, experienced and well-regarded\n\nCost: 2,000 florins (high but fair given valuable cargo)\n\nShip well-maintained, crew disciplined\n\nGrimaldi recognized the value of cargo and priced accordingly\n\nMediterranean Crossing (August 14-18)\n\nDay One (August 14):\n\nDeparted with morning tide\n\nMost of party suffered mild seasickness, including Juan\n\nFray Hernando stoically praying despite queasiness\n\nCaptain Grimaldi noted two ships shadowing at distance\n\nDays Two-Three (August 15-16):\n\nSteady progress with good northern winds\n\nParty found sea legs\n\nGrimaldi altered course away from Balearic Islands to avoid corsair activity\n\nAdded half-day to journey but increased safety\n\nDay Four (August 17):\n\nTense encounter with unidentified galley\n\nSleek vessel with dark sail, no flag, approached rapidly\n\nGrimaldi ordered battle stations\n\nJuan's guards formed up around banner and treasury\n\nStrange galley closed to within one mile, observed, then broke away south\n\nLikely pirates deciding the Sant'Angelo was too well-armed\n\nDay Five (August 18):\n\nBarcelona came into view\n\nRoyal standard of Aragon flying from harbor fortress - formal watch\n\nDocked at main pier late afternoon\n\nResult: Successful crossing - all cargo secure, party intact, reasonable time made (9 days total from Florence including Pisa stop).\n\nARRIVAL IN BARCELONA (August 18)\n\nOfficial Reception\n\nPere de Cardona, Royal Chamberlain of Barcelona, waited at the quay with six men in Crown of Aragon livery. He greeted Juan formally:\n\nWelcomed on behalf of King Alfonso V (currently in Naples)\n\nOffered lodging at Palau Reial Menor\n\nNoted that observers were watching from around the docks\n\nJuan's arrival was clearly anticipated and carefully monitored.\n\nMeeting with Queen María\n\nJuan immediately inquired about meeting his sister, Queen María of Aragon (his older sister, married to Alfonso V). She resided at Palau Reial Major, managing the royal court in Alfonso's absence.\n\nArrangements Made:\n\nSister would visit Juan at his lodgings at Palau Reial Menor\n\nMore intimate than formal throne room audience\n\nAllowed family reunion while maintaining propriety\n\nREUNION WITH SISTER MARÍA (August 18, Evening)\n\nThe Meeting\n\nQueen María arrived at Juan's chambers with evident emotion. She's thirty-three, dark-haired, warm brown eyes (similar to Juan's), wearing fine but simple clothing.\n\nMaría's Initial Reaction:\n\"Dios mío, you look so much like father. The same eyes, the same... Juan. My little brother. You were barely three years old when I left for Barcelona.\"\n\nShe embraced him tightly, trembling with emotion. She noted:\n\nHaven't seen each other except twice in fifteen years, always formal\n\nJuan now a man, a king, wearing white like a knight from old romances\n\nHas heard stories from across Christendom about his journey\n\nRoll Result: Sister's Disposition - 5 (Warm/Affectionate)\n\nMaría proved warm and supportive despite years apart. She remembered him as her baby brother and was moved by reports of his pilgrimage and papal audience.\n\nIntelligence Briefing\n\nMaría shared critical information about events in Castile during Juan's absence:\n\nThe Infantes' Failed Rebellion (May-September 1430):\n\nDuring Juan's pilgrimage, the Infantes de Aragón (María's husband's brothers) attempted to exploit his absence:\n\nMay-June: Political Maneuvering\n\nSent letters portraying Juan as unstable, dominated by low-born Álvaro\n\nCalled unauthorized assembly at Burgos\n\nOnly 23 nobles attended (expected 30-40)\n\nMost nobles sent polite refusals or stayed silent\n\nNo concrete commitments secured\n\nJuly-August: Military Action\n\nAttempted to seize multiple strategic locations\n\nSuccessfully took Arévalo fortress and 2 minor castles\n\nFAILED to take Tordesillas, Olmedo, Segovia, or any major city\n\nSegovia bluntly refused entry: \"Segovia serves the king, not princes of Aragon\"\n\nThe Breaking Point (Mid-August):\n\nRumors reached Castile that Juan met Pope Martin V\n\nNews spread of something significant - possibly a crusade bull\n\nThis devastated the Infantes' position\n\nWavering nobles immediately withdrew support\n\nCoalition collapsed before truly forming\n\nÁlvaro de Luna's Successful Defense:\n\nHeld Valladolid and royal administration\n\nAll major cities remained loyal to crown\n\nJuan's intelligence cabinet functioned effectively\n\nProtected royal treasury and strategic positions\n\nSuccessfully countered Infantes' propaganda\n\nThe Infantes' Current Position (August 1430):\n\nControl Arévalo fortress and 2 minor castles\n\nHave explicit support from 6-8 major noble houses (~12% of nobility)\n\nMaintain support of Master of Santiago (Luis de Guzmán)\n\nCreated temporary instability but failed to build sustainable coalition\n\nExposed as rebels without succeeding\n\nMust now negotiate from profound weakness\n\nMost of Castile remained neutral: ~60% of nobles watched and waited rather than supporting either side.\n\nPolitical Discussion\n\nMaría explained her position in Barcelona:\n\nHer Limited Authority:\n\nManages court, receives ambassadors, hosts ceremonies\n\nDoes NOT rule - that authority rests with Consell Reial (Royal Council)\n\nLed by Archbishop of Zaragoza with several major nobles\n\nThe Corts (Aragonese parliament) guards privileges jealously\n\nQueen without children has limited authority\n\nAlfonso in Naples, focused on Italian campaigns\n\nWhat She Can Do:\n\nShape perceptions and open doors\n\nFacilitate introductions to key figures\n\nProvide valuable intelligence\n\nHer endorsement carries weight even without formal power\n\nThe Infantes' Position in Aragon:\n\nInfante Juan is King of Navarre (separate crown)\n\nIn Aragon, he's just the king's brother - no official authority\n\nCannot command Consell or Corts\n\nCan write letters and scheme but cannot issue orders\n\nMaría suggested Juan could:\n\nDisplay relics publicly in Barcelona Cathedral\n\nMeet privately with Archbishop of Zaragoza\n\nHold audiences with key Catalan noble houses\n\nMake a statement by appearing in Alfonso's city with papal backing\n\nWrite directly to Alfonso in Naples\n\nStrategic Planning Discussion\n\nMaría proposed a multi-week campaign in Barcelona:\n\nWeek 1-2: Cathedral Display and Religious Impact\n\nDisplay True Cross and Santiago's bone publicly\n\nLet Barcelona see what Juan carries\n\nBuild religious fervor\n\nWeek 2-3: Political Meetings\n\nPrivate dinner with Archbishop and Consell members\n\nAudiences with major houses (Urgell, Cardona, Montcada)\n\nShow strength without aggression\n\nLetter to Alfonso V:\n\nTell him about Rome, papal blessing, the crusade\n\nBe respectful but clear about proceeding with papal authority\n\nShow strength, not pleading\n\nTimeline Consideration:\nThis would take 2-3 weeks, meaning:\n\nDepart Barcelona early September\n\nArrive Seville late September/early October\n\nStill have time before November 8 Royal Council\n\nBut timeline would be tight\n\nMaría warned this commits Juan to making a statement - staying in Alfonso's city without explicit permission signals he doesn't need approval. Could anger Alfonso or force him to respect Juan's position.\n\nTHE BARCELONA CAMPAIGN DECISION\n\nJuan decided to commit to the extended Barcelona stay, using the time to build support before the final journey to Seville.\n\nImmediate Actions Decided:\n\nDisplay banner and relics at cathedral Mass (next day, August 19)\n\nInclude Archbishop of Zaragoza in planning\n\nMeet with Consell Reial members\n\nApproach major Catalan noble houses\n\nOrganize recruitment and fundraising\n\nRoute Planning Question:\nJuan raised concern about sailing to Seville given reports of Granada's possible naval activity. Discussion began about sea versus land routes, and possibility of hiring multiple ships for greater security.\n\nTHE FOUR ITALIAN CRUSADERS ARRIVE (August 18, Late Afternoon)\n\nMeeting the First Volunteers\n\nFour men arrived in Barcelona's courtyard having ridden hard from Florence - the first to respond to Juan's speech there:\n\n1. Marco Tornesi (age ~30)\n\nLean, weather-beaten, soldier's bearing\n\nFormer mercenary (Milan, then Genoa)\n\nExperienced fighter, good rider\n\nSpeaks some Castilian\n\nCame seeking to fight for something beyond money\n\n2. Pietro Aldobrandini (mid-20s)\n\nWool merchant's son from Florence\n\nSoft hands, eager eyes, well-dressed\n\nNever fought but been training\n\nClumsy with sword but enthusiastic\n\nHas own horse and funds\n\n3. Giovanni Rossi (age ~45)\n\nFormer blacksmith near Pisa\n\nStocky, strong, has limp from old accident\n\nMissing three fingers on left hand\n\nStill can fight right-handed\n\nWants to serve God before he dies\n\nFierce eyes, devout\n\n4. Andrea Vescovi (barely 20)\n\nFarmer's son from countryside near Florence\n\nTall, gangly, awkward youth\n\nFather died, mother remarried, nothing keeping him home\n\nKnows horses from farm work\n\nCan't fight yet but strong and willing\n\nNervous but determined\n\nCaptain Fernán's Assessment:\n\nMarco is real soldier - only one with genuine combat experience\n\nPietro might become useful with training\n\nGiovanni has spirit but old and injured\n\nAndrea is raw material - could be shaped or killed quickly\n\nNot professional soldiers, but rode 10 days hard to catch Juan\n\nFray Hernando's Assessment (after confessions):\n\nAll sincere, not cynical\n\nMarco carries shame from mercenary past, genuine desire for redemption\n\nPietro has enthusiasm of youth but shallow understanding\n\nGiovanni is simple but genuinely devout\n\nAndrea barely comprehends commitment but wants to serve God\n\nNot perfectly holy, but not seeking adventure or plunder\n\nDecision: Accept all four after testing them physically and spiritually.\n\nPREPARING THE FIRST CRUSADER CEREMONY (August 18-19)\n\nThe Plan\n\nJuan decided to formally accept the four Italians as crusaders before the papal relics, establishing the ritual that would be used for all future recruits.\n\nPreparation (Evening August 18):\n\nBrought the four men to see the banner and relics\n\nJuan prayed at respectful distance while men watched\n\nExplained in Italian what they would be committing to\n\nGave them until dawn to search souls, pray, decide\n\nTesting Period:\nEach man approached relics individually to pray:\n\nMarco: Long, silent prayer, weathered face showing awe and fear\n\nPietro: Animated prayer, tears streaming, young and emotional\n\nGiovanni: Prayed Pater Noster aloud three times, voice cracking\n\nAndrea: Awkward, uncertain, but sincere effort\n\nAll four spent the night in prayer and consultation with Fray Hernando.\n\nThe Crusader Oath Ceremony (August 19, Dawn)\n\nLocation: Palace courtyard at dawn\nWitnesses: All of Juan's party, palace guards and servants watching\n\nThe Ceremony Structure:\n\nJuan had the banner unfurled with both reliquaries mounted - the white silk glowing in morning sun, gold and silver reliquaries blazing.\n\nJuan's Speech (in Italian):\n\nHe explained the crusade's purpose and the vows they would take:\n\nAccept Juan as only commander, follow no other orders\n\nCommit to Christian values and virtues\n\nNO raping or forced conversions\n\nMuslims who surrender will be treated fairly\n\nMust PREVENT others from committing atrocities\n\nWould defend surrendered Muslims with their lives if necessary\n\nFight for justice, mercy, and compassion - that's what it means to be soldier of Christ\n\nPalace servants noted: This was unusual. Most crusade oaths speak of destroying infidels, not protecting them.\n\nIndividual Ceremonies:\n\nEach man knelt before Juan, who tapped their shoulders with his father's sword (Non Nobis Domine inscription visible) and spoke:\n\n\"I accept you, [name], as crusader and soldier of Christ in my crusade to retake Granada.\"\n\nThen each was allowed to touch the reliquaries - first and last time in their earthly life:\n\nAndrea (first crusader):\n\nTrembling with emotion, barely able to stand\n\nTouched reliquaries with just fingertips, afraid of damaging them\n\nTears streaming, thirty seconds of silent prayer\n\nNeeded help standing afterward\n\nMarco (second):\n\nKnelt with soldier's practiced grace\n\nClear oath showing hope mixed with humility\n\nTouched relics firmly, confidently - finally finding something solid\n\nRose and saluted, then bowed with genuine respect\n\nPietro (third):\n\nLeaped forward enthusiastically, then forced himself to be more decorous\n\nLoud oath full of youthful fervor\n\nTouched relics and immediately began weeping and praying loudly\n\nFray Hernando gently helped him rise\n\nGiovanni (fourth):\n\nLimped forward, dropped heavily to knees\n\nSimple oath in rough working-class Italian\n\nTouched relics with both good and damaged hand\n\nSimple, repetitive prayers thanking God\n\nHad to brace against banner pole to stand\n\nFray Hernando's Blessing:\nBlessed all four in Latin, then Italian, reminding them they serve God through His anointed king, carry holy relics toward Granada, must confess regularly and live as Christians.\n\nWitnesses' Reactions:\n\nPalace guards noted the unusual oath about protecting Muslims\n\nOne guard to another: \"Did he just swear to defend surrendered Moors? That's unprecedented.\"\n\nAnother: \"But did you see those men's faces? They believed every word.\"\n\nCAPTAIN FERNÁN'S DEPARTURE MISSION (August 19)\n\nThe Decision to Send Arrest Orders\n\nFollowing intelligence from María about the Infantes' failed rebellion, Juan decided to send Captain Fernán to Castile with orders for Álvaro de Luna to arrest the Infantes for treason.\n\nThe Confrontation with Sister María:\n\nWhen Juan announced his intention, María was alarmed:\n\nThese are her husband's brothers\n\nOrdering their arrest is moving against Aragonese royal family\n\nThey failed and retreated - they're weakened but not desperate\n\nArresting them gives them no choice but total war\n\nForces Alfonso to choose between his brothers and his sister's brother\n\nJuan is sitting in Barcelona (Alfonso's city) while ordering arrest of Alfonso's brothers\n\nMakes Juan look like he's using Alfonso's hospitality to strike at his family\n\nMaría pleaded with Juan to reconsider:\n\nWait until he's back in Castile\n\nWait until after November Royal Council where he can confront them publicly with papal bull\n\nThey're already humiliated - cornering them could make them desperate\n\nThe Infantes' correspondence network might be intercepting letters\n\nThey would know about arrest orders immediately\n\nJuan's Response:\n\nJuan was adamant. He felt the same certainty he'd felt about going to Rome. The Infantes had rebelled, taken fortresses, tried to overthrow him during his absence. They must face consequences.\n\nThe Letter to Álvaro:\n\nWorking with Fray Hernando, Juan drafted a letter ordering Álvaro to:\n\nPublicly demand the Infantes surrender themselves for trial\n\nCharge them with rebellion and treason\n\nProceed only if there are grounds for trial (giving Álvaro discretion)\n\nMake the demand public knowledge\n\nOriginal Phrasing Issue:\n\nJuan initially wrote: \"my mind is as clear when it was when I left for Rome\" - comparing his certainty about this decision to his certainty about the Rome journey.\n\nFray Hernando challenged this phrasing:\n\nCreates association in readers' minds between divine guidance for Rome and political arrest\n\nSuggests this action has same divine sanction as spiritual journey\n\nIf it goes wrong, people will say either Juan was wrong about divine guidance (damaging authority) or that God's will includes civil war bloodshed\n\nRevised Phrasing:\n\nJuan accepted Fray Hernando's wisdom and changed to: \"I have considered this carefully and am resolved.\"\n\nMission Parameters:\n\nCaptain Fernán to travel with Martín and Felipe\n\nThree riders, fast horses, light armor, focused on speed\n\nTwo weeks to Valladolid if pushing hard\n\nLetter sealed with royal seal\n\nFernán fully briefed on intentions\n\nCommand Transfer:\n\nBefore departing, Fernán formally transferred command to Corporal Rodrigo:\n\nGave him the captain's sword belt\n\nCharged him with defense of king's person, security of relics and treasury\n\nSergeant García to serve under Rodrigo providing experience\n\nSir Thomas to serve as military advisor\n\nFernán's Departure (August 19, Dawn):\n\n\"Ride like the wind, you said. That we'll do, Your Majesty. For the crusade. For Castile. Non nobis domine.\"\n\nThe three riders departed at dawn, hoofbeats fading into Barcelona streets.\n\nTHE BARCELONA CATHEDRAL CAMPAIGN (August 20-27)\n\nDay One: August 20 - The First Display\n\nPreparation:\n\nRodrigo had worked overnight coordinating with cathedral and city authorities:\n\nWooden barriers erected in rectangle before main altar (20 feet on each side)\n\nBanner mounted on sturdy pole inside enclosure\n\nGuards at four corners (García, Marco, two cathedral guards)\n\nCrowd management at entrances\n\nArchbishop Juan Martínez de Zaragoza arrived at dawn, moved by what he saw. Lean, ascetic, ~50 years old, intelligent eyes.\n\nThe Mass:\n\n800 people packed cathedral (more than seen in months)\n\nBishop of Barcelona celebrating, Archbishop concelebrating\n\nFray Hernando proclaimed significance of relics in Latin, Catalan, Castilian\n\nRead passages from crusade bull\n\nCrowd Response:\n\nOverwhelming religious fervor:\n\nMany dropped to knees weeping\n\nSound of 800 people praying filled cathedral\n\nPeople strained to see reliquaries\n\nGuards maintained order firmly but respectfully\n\nMeeting with Archbishop of Zaragoza:\n\nSpent hour in private conversation in side chapel. Archbishop asked probing questions about Rome, motivations, crusade plans.\n\nArchbishop's Assessment:\n\n\"Most men would pretend otherwise. Would claim pure piety while pursuing pure politics. Your honesty is unusual for a king. I will support your crusade before the Consell Reial.\"\n\nAfternoon Donations:\n\nTable set up with Diego managing records. By evening: 3,800 florins, mostly small amounts from common people.\n\nDays Two-Three: August 21-22 - Momentum Builds\n\nCathedral Crowds:\n\nBy mid-morning August 21, cathedral packed beyond capacity. City watch helped manage crowds stretching into plaza outside.\n\nCrusader Recruitment System Established:\n\nRodrigo and Fray Hernando created two-stage assessment:\n\nPhysical Assessment (Rodrigo with Sir Thomas and García):\n\nCan they ride? Basic horsemanship tested\n\nCan they fight? Shown practice weapons, demonstration required\n\nPhysically capable? Age, health, strength evaluated\n\nHave resources? Can they equip themselves or need support?\n\nSpiritual Assessment (Fray Hernando):\n\nWhy do they want to join?\n\nConfession and discussion of faith\n\nUnderstanding of crusading vows\n\nAssessment of genuine commitment vs. adventure-seeking\n\nRecruitment Results:\n\nAugust 21: 23 applied, 8 suitable, 6 accepted\n\nAugust 22: 31 applied, 19 passed physical, 9 presented, 7 accepted\n\nThe Elite Dinner (August 22, Evening):\n\nMaría hosted 40 guests - Barcelona's elite - at royal palace. Juan attended and told his story simply and honestly:\n\nThe pilgrimage journey\n\nReturning for father's sword\n\nDiscovering the Infantes' plot\n\nRome and the papal audience\n\nKneeling naked before the Pope\n\nThe blessing received\n\nResponse:\n\nProfound impact. Several merchants pledged major donations immediately:\n\nLorenzo Medina (shipping magnate): 8,000 florins\n\nWool Guild of Barcelona: Provisions for 500 men for 2 months\n\nThree minor noble families: 5,000 florins combined\n\nMeeting Isabel Ruiz (August 22, Evening)\n\nAmong the merchant families present: Rodrigo Ruiz (wealthy cloth merchant), his wife Juana, and their daughter Isabel.\n\nIsabel's Appearance:\n\nAge 17\n\nUnusual auburn hair catching lamplight\n\nPale skin with freckles\n\nBright green eyes that seem to see through pretense\n\nFine but modest deep blue gown\n\nSlightly awkward curtsy - learned forms but not entirely comfortable\n\nRodrigo Ruiz's Background:\n\nConverso family - grandfather born Jewish, converted to save family. Family has worked hard to prove Christianity and loyalty. Successful in trade, wealthy, but always watched and judged.\n\nThe Meeting:\n\nRodrigo had been at Florence speech on business. Came home changed, couldn't stop talking about white banner and Juan's words. When Juan spoke about protecting Muslims who surrender, about mercy and justice, Rodrigo thought: \"this is what true Christianity means.\"\n\nRodrigo's Pledge: 20,000 florins (half now, half when crusade begins march) - everything his family can contribute.\n\nIsabel's Question:\n\nShe challenged Juan directly: \"Do you truly mean what you said? About protecting Muslims who convert or surrender? Because many crusaders have said such things before, and then...\"\n\nHer mother was mortified by the bold question.\n\nJuan's Response: \"Yes. I mean it. I've sworn it before God and before the True Cross itself.\"\n\nIsabel's Assessment: \"I believe you. I don't know why, but I do.\"\n\nThe Connection:\n\nJuan found himself intensely aware of Isabel throughout the evening:\n\nHow she listened carefully to everyone\n\nSlight furrow in brow when troubled\n\nHow her eyes sometimes met his then darted away\n\nHer genuine, questioning nature versus practiced court ladies\n\nMaría's Warning (After Dinner):\n\nMaría noticed Juan's distraction. She explained:\n\nIsabel is converso - will always be judged for it\n\nMerchant's daughter, not nobility\n\nAny attachment would be extremely complicated politically\n\nSome find her too bold, too questioning for a woman\n\nBut she's unusual - educated, intelligent, genuine\n\n\"Be careful, hermano.\"\n\nBut Isabel's face stayed in Juan's mind.\n\nDays Four-Five: August 23-24 - Growing Success\n\nContinued Displays:\n\nCrowds remained large. Everyone in Barcelona and surrounding countryside now knew about the True Cross and Santiago's bone.\n\nDonations Accelerated:\n\nAugust 23: 12,000 florins from noble families and merchants\n\nAugust 24: 8,000 florins, including 500 florins from Barcelona Jewish community (\"For protection of all peoples of the Book\")\n\nCrusader Recruitment:\n\nAugust 23: 41 applied, 12 suitable, 9 accepted\n\nAugust 24: 53 applied, 15 suitable, 12 accepted\n\nTraining Organization:\n\nRodrigo organized crusaders into formations. García and Sir Thomas worked daily on sword work, pike drill, horsemanship. Marco proved excellent as training sergeant.\n\nFray Hernando's Work:\n\nTireless daily confessions, group instruction, theological discussions. Building the spiritual culture Juan requested - making confession and faith central to crusader identity.\n\nArchbishop's Decision (August 24, Evening):\n\nArchbishop of Zaragoza requested private audience with Juan and María. He announced:\n\n\"I've spent four days watching this. The Consell Reial meets in two days. I will tell them that Aragon should support your crusade. I will write to King Alfonso in Naples about what I've witnessed - that you carry papal authority that cannot be questioned.\"\n\nThis was the political breakthrough Juan needed.\n\nDays Six-Seven: August 25-27 - Major Commitments\n\nAugust 25: Consell Reial Meeting\n\nArchbishop addressed the council (Juan not present - not a member). He described:\n\nPapal commission Juan carries\n\nThe relics (True Cross, Santiago's bone)\n\nCrowds' genuine devotion\n\nCareful screening of crusaders\n\nArgued Aragon should view crusade as Spain's crusade, not just Castile's\n\nConsell Reial Decision:\n\nGrant Juan safe passage through Aragonese territory\n\nAllow recruitment in Aragon (voluntary)\n\nProvide favorable terms for supplies/provisions\n\nSend formal letter to Alfonso recommending support\n\nNot everything Juan might want, but substantial progress.\n\nAugust 26: Major Noble Support\n\nThree major Catalan families pledged formal support:\n\nMontcadas, Cervelló, Cardona families\n\nCombined 15,000 florins in donations\n\nAgreement to allow vassals to join crusade if they choose\n\nFuture military support to be negotiated\n\nPere de Cardona requested audience - his daughter Catalina (one of María's ladies) had been attending displays, deeply moved, wanted to speak with Juan.\n\nMeeting Catalina de Cardona:\n\nAge 20, intelligent, elegant. Asked perceptive questions about crusade conduct, commitment to mercy, maintaining discipline. Clearly assessing whether family support was wise.\n\nProfessionally respectful conversation. But Juan found himself comparing her unfavorably to Isabel - Catalina polished where Isabel genuine, practiced where Isabel spontaneous.\n\nAugust 27: Final Major Display\n\nCathedral packed for morning Mass. Archbishop of Zaragoza preached about divine providence, God's will made manifest, call to holy service.\n\nJuan's Final Address:\n\nSimple statement rather than grand speech: \"I am Juan, King of Castile, servant of God, bearer of His holy relics. I march to Granada not for glory but for obedience. Not for conquest but for conversion. Join me if you feel called.\"\n\nOverwhelming response. People rushed forward to pledge, donate, touch barriers near relics.\n\nFinal Week Tallies:\n\nDonations:\n\nNobles and major merchants: 68,000 florins\n\nCommon people and smaller sources: 14,000 florins\n\nTotal: 82,000 florins (more than 4x annual Castilian royal revenue)\n\nCrusader Recruits:\n\nApplications: 248 men total\n\nAfter assessment: 73 presented\n\nAccepted: 58 (plus original 4 = 62 crusaders total)\n\nQuality Assessment:\n\n12 experienced soldiers or minor knights\n\n31 competent fighters with basic training\n\n15 raw but promising\n\nAll passed Fray Hernando's spiritual screening\n\nPolitical Achievements:\n\nArchbishop of Zaragoza actively supporting\n\nConsell Reial granted safe passage and support\n\nThree major Catalan families pledged backing\n\nLetter going to Alfonso V recommending support\n\nJuan's reputation in Aragon transformed\n\nTHE ISABEL CRISIS (August 27, Evening)\n\nJuan's Confession to María\n\nAfter the exhausting final day of displays, Juan met privately with María in her chambers.\n\nJuan's Admission:\n\n\"María, I come to you as your brother. Isabel... I must see her again.\"\n\nMaría's Understanding:\n\nShe immediately recognized what had happened. Since the dinner three days ago, Juan had been distracted, unable to stop thinking about Isabel.\n\nThe Feelings Discussion:\n\nJuan revealed he couldn't stop thinking about Isabel - where she might be, how he could arrange to see her, wanting to impress her, imagining being alone with her to kiss and hold her.\n\nMaría explained: \"That sounds like love. Or at least the beginning of it. The not being able to stop thinking about her, wanting to arrange your life around seeing her - that's what it feels like when your heart is caught.\"\n\nMaría's Own Story:\n\nShe shared her experience - at 16, fell for a young knight at Valladolid court. Thought about him constantly, wondered where he'd be, imagined if he held her hand or kissed her. Then Father arranged her marriage to Alfonso for alliance with Aragon. Never saw the knight again. Doesn't even know if he felt anything for her.\n\nThe Hard Truth:\n\nMaría explained the complications:\n\nIsabel is converso - will always face prejudice\n\nMerchant's daughter, not nobility\n\nAny relationship beyond friendship would be scandalous politically\n\nMarriage to converso merchant's daughter would create enormous complications\n\nBut more fundamentally: Isabel couldn't be pursued just for pleasure then abandoned\n\n\"If you just want her, you'd be destroying her reputation, marriage prospects, family standing for a few nights. That's not just sinful - it's cruel.\"\n\n\"But if you truly love her - if this is your heart - then you're walking into dangerous territory. Love makes people do foolish things.\"\n\nThe Practical Offer:\n\nMaría agreed to arrange for Isabel to visit:\n\nInvite Isabel and her mother for tea with several ladies\n\nJuan could \"happen to visit\" during that time\n\nCompletely innocent, nothing scandalous\n\nOpportunity to talk, get to know her better\n\nSee if the feeling is just overwhelming attraction or something deeper\n\nShe could also arrange for more private conversation if afternoon went well - perhaps walk in palace gardens with María and Isabel's mother nearby but out of earshot.\n\nMaría's Condition:\n\n\"Promise me you'll be careful with her heart. If you treat her as someone to secretly romance then set aside, I'll never forgive you. You would deserve the guilt that would haunt you.\"\n\nThe Warning:\n\n\"If you truly fall in love with Isabel, what then? You're a king. You have crusade to lead. You need political alliances. A marriage to converso merchant's daughter would create enormous complications. Count that cost before you let your heart run away with you.\"\n\nThe Plan:\n\nTea arranged for next day (August 28). Juan would see Isabel again, talk with her, and perhaps learn if this was real or just beautiful painful ache of young attraction.\n\nTHE AFTERNOON TEA (August 28, Afternoon)\n\nPreparation\n\nJuan spent morning in agony of preparation:\n\nInsisted on washing thoroughly multiple times\n\nCombed hair repeatedly\n\nAdjusted doublet obsessively\n\nServants bemused by attention to detail\n\nFray Hernando noticed nervous energy, gave knowing look but said nothing\n\nRodrigo mentioned Juan seemed \"distracted\"\n\nThe Gift:\n\nMaría had provided a book of Castilian poetry (Cancionero) - valuable but not extravagant, appropriate gift showing Juan noticed Isabel's education. Poetry is language of courtship.\n\nJuan's Attire:\n\nDark blue doublet with silver threading - handsome, well-made, but not overwhelming. Makes him look like young nobleman rather than crusading saint or political force.\n\nThe Gathering\n\nSetting: María's private garden chamber opening onto courtyard with flowering plants and fountain.\n\nAttendees:\n\nQueen María (hostess)\n\nJuana Ruiz (Isabel's mother, ~40, shrewd eyes)\n\nIsabel Ruiz (wearing deep green gown that made auburn hair catch fire in sunlight)\n\nThree other ladies-in-waiting\n\nJuan's Entrance:\n\nArrived quarter-hour after ladies, as planned. María performed theatrical surprise: \"Your Majesty! How delightful. I wasn't expecting you.\"\n\nIsabel's Reaction:\n\nDeep green gown, auburn hair blazing in afternoon light, faint blush (warmth or Juan's arrival?). Green eyes widened when she saw him, emotion flickered across face too quickly to read.\n\nThe Conversation\n\nInitial Topics:\n\nMaría steered conversation to poetry. Isabel mentioned reading Latin poetry, finding meaning sometimes escaped her though language was beautiful.\n\nThe Exchange:\n\nJuan asked what poets she'd read. Isabel: \"Ovid, mostly. The Metamorphoses. Stories of transformation, gods becoming mortals, mortals becoming something else. I found it fascinating how easily boundaries between different states of being could be crossed.\"\n\nDiscussed moral lessons - Isabel's tutor (Father García, Franciscan) said pagan poets expressed Christian truths without knowing it. Transformation and change always possible through grace.\n\nConnection Building:\n\nJuan found himself leaning forward, genuinely curious. Conversation flowed naturally between them. They kept returning to each other despite other women present.\n\nTopics included:\n\nLives of saints (Juan's favorite: Saint Martin of Tours)\n\nWhether Juan was named after him (admitted he'd never asked)\n\nFinding truth in unexpected places\n\nScripture and Church teaching\n\nAn hour passed. Juan forgot to be nervous.\n\nThe Garden Moment\n\nMaría stood, suggested taking turn in garden to see roses. The group moved outside.\n\nThe Choreography:\n\nMaría deliberately engaged Juana Ruiz in conversation, drawing her toward far side of garden where roses grew. Other ladies drifted away admiring flowers and fountain.\n\nPerfectly innocent - everyone still visible - but Juan and Isabel suddenly standing near each other with no one immediately beside them. Fountain noise covering quiet conversation.\n\nThe Gift:\n\nJuan: \"Lady Isabel, I... I brought something. For you.\" Held out wrapped book. \"Your father mentioned your education, you spoke about poetry. I thought you might enjoy this.\"\n\nIsabel looked surprised: \"Your Majesty, I couldn't possibly—\"\n\n\"Please. It's just a book. A collection of Castilian poetry. Nothing inappropriate. Just something I thought an educated woman might appreciate.\"\n\nHer Reaction:\n\nShe took it carefully, unwrapping enough to see binding. Fingers traced leather cover reverently.\n\n\"It's beautiful.\" Then looked up at him. For just a moment, modest mask slipped. Genuine feeling visible - gratitude, confusion, something deeper she wasn't sure how to name.\n\nThe Question:\n\n\"Your Majesty, why are you doing this? Being here. Bringing me gifts. I'm just... I'm a merchant's daughter. You're... you're a king.\"\n\nJuan's Honesty:\n\n\"I wanted to see you again. Since the dinner, I haven't been able to stop thinking about—\" He stopped himself. Too much, too fast. \"About our conversation. About what you said about mercy and justice and truth.\"\n\nIsabel's Response:\n\nDeep blush now. \"Your Majesty, I... I don't know what to say.\" Looked down at book.\n\nJuan asked her to keep the book, to let him see her again to talk about poetry or theology or anything.\n\nIsabel's Resistance:\n\nVery quietly: \"Your Majesty, I'm not someone you should be interested in. My family is converso. People whisper about us. And I'm not noble, I'm not...\"\n\n\"I don't care about that.\"\n\nTears in her eyes now: \"But you should care, Your Majesty. You're a king. You have crusade to lead. I'm nobody. And if people see you paying attention to me, they'll say terrible things. About both of us.\"\n\nInterruption:\n\nMaría's voice from roses: \"Your Majesty! Come see these blooms, they're extraordinary!\"\n\nMoment shattered. Isabel stepped back quickly, clutching book to chest. Curtsied deeply, face averted. \"Thank you for the gift, Your Majesty. It's very generous.\"\n\nModest mask back in place, but eyes still wet.\n\nThe Aftermath\n\nTea concluded. Ladies departed with appropriate farewells. Juana Ruiz thanked María profusely. Isabel curtsied, murmured \"Your Majesty,\" and left with book wrapped carefully.\n\nMaría's Assessment:\n\nWhen alone, asked: \"How do you feel?\"\n\nJUAN'S CRISIS OF CERTAINTY (August 28, Evening)\n\nInitial Despair\n\nJuan's interpretation: \"She doesn't want me. She thinks it's inappropriate. I've been a fool. I will never make that mistake again.\"\n\nMaría's Intervention\n\nMaría stopped him firmly: \"That girl was in tears. Not because she doesn't want you. Because she does, and it terrifies her.\"\n\nMaría's Analysis:\n\nIf Isabel didn't care:\n\nWould have accepted gift with polite smile\n\nMade appropriate small talk\n\nForgotten about him moment she left\n\nBut instead:\n\nGot emotional, tried to push Juan away\n\nListed reasons he SHOULDN'T be interested\n\nAlready thinking about what relationship would mean\n\nTrying to protect Juan and herself from consequences\n\nHad tears in eyes\n\n\"That's not indifference. That's someone who wants something she thinks she can't have. That's someone already feeling more than she should and trying to be responsible.\"\n\nThe Reality of Women's Position:\n\nMaría explained Isabel can't just say what she feels:\n\nSociety doesn't let her\n\nHer position doesn't allow it\n\nShowing interest in a king risks everything\n\nHer reputation could be destroyed by gossip\n\nFamily could be accused of social climbing or manipulation\n\nPeople would say she seduced him, family planned it\n\n\"When she said 'you shouldn't be interested in me' - that wasn't rejection. That was her trying to protect you from mistake she thinks would hurt you. That's what love looks like.\"\n\nThe Advice:\n\nNot to give up after one difficult conversation. Real courtship requires patience, navigating obstacles, showing someone they're worth the effort.\n\n\"Was it just attraction that's now disappointed? Or is it something more?\"\n\nJuan's Certainty Strikes\n\nJuan's response: \"We have been apart so long that I understand you do not know me when I am filled with purpose. Some call it the will of God. I don't, but I do know there are moments when I am absolutely certain about what to do and right now, this is it.\"\n\nThe Decision:\n\n\"My mind is made up and nothing can move me away from my purpose. You will summon Isabel and her mother tomorrow for private audience with me, yourself, and my confessor. I will tell her everything and that will be that. God's purpose demands sacrifice and my commitment is absolute.\"\n\nMaría's Pain:\n\nShe stood very still, dozen emotions crossing her face - hurt, worry, frustration, resignation, love mixed with fear.\n\n\"I see. You're right. We have been apart a long time. Perhaps I don't know this version of you - the one filled with absolute certainty, unmovable by anything or anyone.\"\n\nShe agreed to arrange meeting but warned: \"If you're going to tell that girl you love her and then tell her you can never be together because duty demands it... that's not kindness. That's not mercy. That's giving her a wound that will take years to heal.\"\n\n\"But I understand. Your mind is made up. Nothing I say will change it.\"\n\nThe Request:\n\n\"I have one request. When you're there tomorrow, before you speak - look at Father Hernando. Really look at him. See if he approves. See if his face shows this is God's will, or if he looks troubled.\"\n\nThe Farewell:\n\n\"I pray you're right. I pray this certainty IS God's will, and not just young king too afraid to fight for something that doesn't fit neatly into his plans. Because if you're wrong...\"\n\nShe didn't finish. Just closed door quietly.\n\nCONVERSATION WITH FRAY HERNANDO (August 28, Late Evening)\n\nFinding the Confessor\n\nJuan found Fray Hernando in small chapel, kneeling before altar after long day hearing confessions. Exhausted but alert when Juan arrived.\n\nThe Confession\n\nJuan revealed everything:\n\nFallen in love with Isabel\n\nShe's converso merchant's daughter\n\nSmart, educated, beautiful\n\nMet her again with María's help\n\nThinks there's genuine connection\n\nBut realized he cannot be with her without marrying her\n\nMarriage doesn't align with God's plan and purpose\n\nGave her poetry book, made feelings clear between lines\n\nArranged meeting tomorrow to tell her he loves her but they can never be together\n\nWants to do it honestly, genuinely, doesn't want to hurt her\n\nBut must cut away feelings that lead to temptation and sin\n\nAbsolutely certain this must be done\n\nFray Hernando's Response\n\nInitial Reaction: \"No.\"\n\nJust that word, flat and definitive. Then: \"I will not participate in what you're planning tomorrow.\"\n\nThe Confrontation:\n\n\"You came to inform me, not ask for guidance. You've made up your mind with that certainty you feel. But I'm going to speak anyway.\"\n\n\"What you're planning - telling that young woman you love her but can never be with her - that's not sacrifice. That's not serving God's purpose. That's cruelty dressed up in pious language.\"\n\nThe Challenge:\n\n\"You say you don't want to hurt her, but you're going to tell her you love her and then reject her? In front of her mother, your sister, and me? You're going to wound her deeply, publicly, and call it duty? That's not mercy. That's not Christian virtue. That's you wanting to feel noble about breaking someone's heart.\"\n\nOn Divine Will:\n\n\"How do you know this is God's will? Have you prayed about it? Asked God what He wants? Or decided what you want and convinced yourself it's God's will?\"\n\nOn Sin:\n\n\"Falling in love isn't a sin. Being attracted to woman isn't sin. Even desiring her isn't inherently sinful - that's how God made us. Sin comes when we use people, when we lie, when we let desire override virtue.\"\n\n\"You're not proposing to seduce and abandon her. You're feeling genuine love. And now you're planning to reject that love because... why? Because she's converso? Because she's not politically useful? Because loving her would be complicated?\"\n\nThe Distinction:\n\n\"Those are valid concerns. Political complications are real. But don't call them 'God's purpose.' Don't pretend you're making sacrifice for holiness when you're really avoiding something difficult and calling it duty.\"\n\nOn Discernment:\n\n\"True divine guidance leads to humility, charity, peace - even when path is hard. It serves others' good, not just your comfort. Does your plan lead to humility? Serve her good? Bring peace? Or does it let you feel noble while avoiding risk?\"\n\nThe Refusal:\n\n\"You want me there tomorrow to give this spiritual weight. But I won't do it. I won't watch you hurt that young woman and pretend it's God's will.\"\n\nThe Alternative:\n\n\"If you genuinely believe you cannot marry her - if political complications are truly insurmountable - then don't tell her you love her. Just let it fade. Be polite but distant. That would be kinder.\"\n\n\"Or tell the truth: 'I'm attracted to you, I care, but complications are too great and I'm not brave enough to fight through them.' That's honest. But don't tell her you love her and frame rejecting her as holy sacrifice.\"\n\nThe Final Challenge:\n\n\"Juan, this looks like fear. Fear dressed up as purpose. And I won't bless it with my presence.\"\n\n\"So talk to me. Not about what you've decided, but what you're feeling. Not about God's purpose, but your heart. Tell me - setting aside politics and duty and crusades - what do you actually want?\"\n\nJuan's Revised Question\n\nAfter Fray Hernando's intervention, Juan stepped back:\n\n\"Let me take a step back. I have fallen in love with someone I cannot - or will not - pursue. I have invited her and her mother to meet with me and my sister. How should I proceed?\"\n\nFray Hernando's Response:\n\nVisible relief. Thanked Juan for clarification and not claiming God's will.\n\nAsked: \"Why did you arrange this meeting? What did you intend to accomplish?\"\n\nExplained several options exist, each with different consequences. Can't advise until understanding what Juan actually wants to achieve.\n\nJuan's Honest Answer\n\n\"I value honesty as virtue. Best way to navigate was to lay it all out open. Open my heart like good Christian. My reasoning: 'How can being honest be wrong?' But maybe this leads to more hurt. I hate when we need to be dishonest.\"\n\nThe Vision:\n\n\"I dream of God's kingdom. If we cannot be together in this world, I imagine our love to exist in God's kingdom. When I catch glimpse in inspired moment, I can catch glimpse of her, of love I feel for her. There it shall stay, there I shall nurture it. There it can be safe. I hope she can find way to put her love for me away. Where it's safe, pure, everlasting.\"\n\nFray Hernando's Analysis\n\nOn the Vision:\n\n\"What you described - this vision of love existing purely in God's kingdom - that's beautiful. It's what mystics write about. Saints have wrestled with similar ideas. Love that transcends earthly limitations, becomes spiritual and eternal. That's not wrong in itself.\"\n\nThe Problem:\n\n\"But you're planning to tell Isabel: 'I love you, but we cannot be together in this world. Instead, I'll keep that love safe in my vision of God's kingdom, where it can be pure and eternal. I hope you can do the same.'\"\n\n\"Do you understand what that would sound like to her? To seventeen-year-old woman who just met you, who's feeling something she didn't expect, who's already frightened by complications?\"\n\n\"It would sound like you're asking her to love you spiritually but not physically. To keep feelings locked away as holy offering. To live knowing King of Castile loves her in abstract heavenly way but won't actually be with her.\"\n\nThe Burden:\n\n\"That's not honesty. That's not opening your heart. That's giving her impossible burden. You're asking her to carry weight of your love her entire life, knowing it can never be real, somehow making it 'safe and pure' in spiritual realm.\"\n\n\"It's selfish. You get to keep your feelings, nurture them in private vision, feel noble about it. But she has to live with knowledge you love her, that you could pursue but won't, and somehow transform that into something 'everlasting' while living normal life. Maybe marrying someone else. Maybe never marrying because you've made her love you.\"\n\nOn Honesty:\n\n\"Sometimes honesty without wisdom is just selfishness. Sometimes kind thing is not to share everything you're feeling.\"\n\n\"Your dream of God's kingdom where love for Isabel exists purely - that's your spiritual journey, your inner life. But dragging her into that dream, making her complicit, asking her to share abstract eternal love while you both live separate earthly lives? That's not fair to her.\"\n\nThe Key Question:\n\n\"Is this meeting tomorrow actually for her benefit, or is it for yours? Are you doing this so she understands and can move forward? Or so YOU can feel honest, have closure, declare your love and feel noble about sacrificing it?\"\n\n\"If it's for you - if this is about your need to be honest, your vision of eternal love, your feelings - then you're using her. Making her carry weight of your emotions so you can feel better.\"\n\n\"But if it's truly for her - if you genuinely want to spare her false hope and help her move forward - then you don't need this meeting. You simply step back. Be polite but distant. Let moment pass. That would be kinder.\"\n\nTHE REALIZATION AND CHANGE (August 28, Night)\n\nJuan's Moment of Clarity\n\n\"If I was in her shoes, this is what I would have wanted. But maybe I was wrong and did not understand fully her own position. The best way for me to distance myself fully from her is to confront it head-on. But that is selfish, I see that now.\"\n\nThe Admission:\n\n\"Father... I was wrong. The feeling I had just an hour ago, the absolute certainty about how to proceed. I was wrong.\"\n\nThe Crisis of Certainty\n\nJuan revealed his five moments of absolute certainty:\n\nGoing to Rome\n\nGoing back to fetch father's sword\n\nRenunciating before the Pope\n\nSending Captain away to arrest Infantes\n\nJust now about Isabel\n\nThe Fear:\n\n\"This is the first time I changed my mind later. This brings terrifying consequences. What if sending Captain away was also mistake?\"\n\nFray Hernando's Response\n\nOn Juan's Admission:\n\nProfound relief and emotion. \"Do you know how rare it is - how truly extraordinary - for someone to say 'I was wrong' about something they felt absolute certainty about?\"\n\n\"Most people, especially kings, would rather destroy themselves and everyone around them than admit uncertainty. But you just did. That's not weakness. That's wisdom. That's grace.\"\n\nOn the Crisis:\n\n\"Cancel the meeting. Go to María tonight, tell her it's cancelled. She'll understand. She'll be relieved.\"\n\nOn Certainty:\n\nAnalyzed Juan's five moments:\n\nGoing to Rome: Resulted in extraordinary papal audience, crusade bull, True Cross\n\nGetting sword: Discovered Infantes' plot\n\nRenunciating before Pope: Moved him to tears, secured backing\n\nAll three worked remarkably well\n\n\"The Isabel certainty was different. It wasn't about your mission or crusade or political survival. It was about personal feelings, your heart, something you desperately wanted answer to. Maybe those kinds of certainties - ones about own emotions - are less reliable.\"\n\nOn the Infantes:\n\n\"The Infantes. Let's think carefully. You ordered arrest based on reports they rebelled, seized fortresses, tried to rally nobles. Those reports came from Álvaro, from your network, from María herself. Those are facts, not feelings.\"\n\n\"Question isn't whether certainty about their guilt was wrong. Question is whether arresting them - that specific action, in that way - was right response.\"\n\n\"Even if risky, even if might go wrong - there's real argument that traitors must face consequences. That king who doesn't hold rebels accountable looks weak. That might be wrong, but it's not obviously selfish or cruel like Isabel meeting would have been.\"\n\nThe Advice:\n\n\"You could send another rider. Fast horses. New orders to modify original command. Perhaps arrest only if certain conditions met. Coordinate with Álvaro first. Give Infantes chance to surrender voluntarily.\"\n\n\"But you need to be clear why. Is it because you genuinely think original order was wrong? Or because you're panicking after realizing you were wrong about Isabel?\"\n\n\"There's difference between wise reconsideration and second-guessing yourself into paralysis.\"\n\nJuan's Decision\n\n\"I think it's still good idea to send Captain with orders. I included Álvaro should arrest only if cause enough for trial. Orders stand.\"\n\n\"I just feel disappointed and ashamed I was wrong and maybe prideful and too sure. Next time I feel I must do something, I must think very carefully before pushing through.\"\n\nMaría's Response:\n\n\"Good. Orders stand. Clear decision for clear reasons. And yes, you were wrong about Isabel. But fact you recognized it - that you let Fray Hernando challenge you, that you changed your mind - that's not weakness.\"\n\nShe drafted message to Ruiz family immediately: Something polite about crusade business requiring attention.\n\nCancellation Message:\n\nNext morning, María would send: \"The King sends his apologies, but urgent crusade business has arisen and he must cancel tomorrow's audience. He hopes to have pleasure of seeing family at future court functions.\"\n\nPolite, respectful, nothing dramatic. Ruiz family would be disappointed but not suspicious.\n\nThe Lesson\n\nFray Hernando: \"The certainty you feel sometimes - about going to Rome, about crusade - maybe some IS divine guidance. But maybe some is just youth, passion, conviction. Learning to tell difference - learning to question even your certainties - that's how you become not just powerful king, but wise one.\"\n\nCOUNCIL MEETING: PLANNING NEXT STEPS (August 28, Late Night)\n\nAssembling the Council\n\nJuan summoned his core advisors to his chambers:\n\nSir Thomas Beaumont (military advisor)\n\nFray Hernando de Talavera (confessor)\n\nRodrigo (new captain after Fernán's departure)\n\nThe three arrived within quarter hour and settled around table.\n\nStrategic Assessment\n\nJuan's Question: After week in Barcelona with substantial gains and modest fighting force, should they accomplish more here or prepare for final stretch to Seville?\n\nSir Thomas's Analysis:\n\n\"Barcelona has been remarkably successful:\n\n62 crusaders recruited (half decent fighters, rest need training but willing)\n\n82,000 florins substantial sum\n\nArchbishop's backing gives legitimacy in Aragon\n\nBut we're stretched thin:\n\nSeven experienced fighters counting you\n\n62 recruits not battle-ready\n\nEvery day we stay risks complications - political attention, Infantes' agents, more time for Granada to prepare\n\nRodrigo's Perspective:\n\n\"Training going well. García, Marco, Sir Thomas and I drilling them daily. In another 2-3 weeks, better ones will be competent for real service. But right now they can march and guard camp, not fight real battle without heavy support.\"\n\nEquipment still being procured - half armed properly, rest have basic gear but nothing standardized.\n\nFray Hernando's View:\n\n\"Men's faith genuine. Working with them daily - confession, instruction, building culture you wanted. But spiritual formation takes time.\"\n\nBrother Tomás (Franciscan) agreed to join as chaplain. Meeting tomorrow with Dominican and Benedictine - might recruit 2-3 more priests if staying another week.\n\nTimeline Consideration:\n\nRoyal Council: November 8, 1430\n\nCurrent date: August 28\n\nTen weeks until council\n\nIf leave early September: 6-7 weeks in Seville before council (adequate)\n\nIf stay 3 more weeks: arrive mid-late September, only 5 weeks before council (tighter)\n\nRoute Discussion\n\nSea vs. Land Routes:\n\nSir Thomas: \"Sea route normally faster - week by galley with good winds. Land through Aragon and into Castile takes 3-4 weeks, possibly longer with difficulties.\"\n\nBut Mediterranean more dangerous if Granada has war galleys active. Corsairs would love to capture ship carrying King of Castile plus relics and crusade funds.\n\nGarcía's View: \"On land we see threats coming, choose route, avoid danger, camp where we want. On ship, if spotted and pursued, nowhere to run. Trapped on wooden box in sea.\"\n\nBut land travel through Aragon means passing through territory where Infantes have influence. Ambushes could be prepared.\n\nRodrigo: \"With only seven capable fighters, we're vulnerable either way. On ship, dependent on crew and captain. On land, control our defense but exposed to bandits, hostile nobles, worse.\"\n\nTime Factor: Sea saves 2-3 weeks, giving extra time in Seville to coordinate with Álvaro, meet supporters, plan crusade bull presentation.\n\nMixed Approach Suggested: Travel overland through Aragon to Castilian border, reassess. If safe, take ship from Valencia or Cartagena for final leg. Reduces sea exposure while saving some time.\n\nIntelligence Needs\n\nNeed to gather information:\n\nGranada's current naval activity\n\nSafe land routes through Aragon\n\nPolitical situation updates\n\nMaría could help through Consell contacts. Could hire local guides who know safe roads.\n\nJuan's Decision on Multiple Ships\n\nJuan proposed hiring three ships instead of one for greater security:\n\nSir Thomas's Response:\n\n\"Sound military thinking. Multiple ships reduce risk:\n\nIf one damaged/attacked, don't lose everything\n\nRelics, treasury, your person distributed across vessels\n\nShips can defend each other - three together less attractive to pirates\n\nMore swords in boarding action\n\nFlexibility if one ship has problems\n\nCost: Three galleys Barcelona to Seville probably 5,000-6,000 florins total\n\nCoordination Needed: Captains who've worked together, proper distribution of forces\n\nSecurity Issue Raised:\n\nJuan clarified: Four sworn banner guards must always stay with banner. Cannot divide them across ships. Guards and relics stay together on flagship.\n\nRodrigo: \"Understood. Banner and guards together on one ship. Simpler and maintains sacred charge properly.\"\n\nThe Three-Week Plan\n\nJuan's Proposal: Stay in Barcelona three more weeks, then sail with three ships to Seville.\n\nBenefits:\n\nThree weeks training makes crusaders competent (not veterans, but solid)\n\nEveryone properly equipped - look like army, not mob\n\nFray Hernando can recruit more chaplains\n\nTime to gather intelligence about sea route\n\nCan shift to overland if needed\n\nMultiple ships provide security\n\nCouncil Agreement:\n\nAll three advisors agreed this was sound plan:\n\nSir Thomas: \"Risks manageable, benefits substantial\"\n\nRodrigo: \"I support this plan\"\n\nFray Hernando: \"Gives me time to build chaplain corps properly, men truly become crusaders\"\n\nTimeline Finalized:\n\nThree more weeks in Barcelona (through mid-September)\n\nDepart September 15-18\n\nThree ships to Seville (8-10 days voyage)\n\nArrive Seville late September\n\nFive weeks before November 8 Royal Council (tight but adequate)\n\nDESIGNING THE CRUSADER IDENTITY (August 28, Late Night - Continued)\n\nUniform Equipment Discussion\n\nJuan's Vision:\n\nWanted common uniform equipment for crusaders - garb setting them apart from other fighting orders. White was Juan's alone. Needed something distinctive for crusaders.\n\nSir Thomas's Suggestion:\n\n\"White tabards with red crosses? It echoes your personal garb while being distinct.\"\n\nNoted this was very close to Knights Templar design (white mantles with red crosses), but Templars dissolved over century ago. Symbolism not claimed by anyone now.\n\n\"Could work in your favor - people remember Templars as elite crusaders. Evoking that legacy could be powerful.\"\n\nFray Hernando's Concern:\n\n\"'Non Nobis Domine' - that's from Psalm 115. It was Templars' motto. You're essentially reclaiming Templar imagery for new crusade.\"\n\n\"Either brilliant or dangerous. Some will honor noble tradition. Others might worry you're trying to resurrect dissolved order. But given papal backing, it could work.\"\n\nPractical Details:\n\nTabards: White cloth with red cross on front and back\n\nWorn over armor, easy to put on/remove, clearly visible\n\nBarcelona has excellent textile workers\n\n62 tabards at 4-5 florins each = ~300 florins\n\nThree weeks sufficient to commission\n\nShields: White background, red cross. Clear, visible in battle, recognizable from distance. 15-20 florins per shield = 900-1,200 florins\n\nWar Cry: \"Non Nobis Domine\" - reclaiming Templar motto\n\nNo Conflict: Templar order dissolved, imagery available. With papal backing, any questions could be answered by pointing to Pope's authorization.\n\nThe Clasp System\n\nPurpose: Identify crusaders, award them ceremonially in Seville at Royal Council (as Juan promised in Florence speech).\n\nThree-Tier System Designed:\n\n1. Common Crusader Clasp:\n\nSimple iron\n\nCross design\n\n\"GRANADA\" inscribed beneath\n\nClear goal, Christian symbol\n\n2-3 maravedís each\n\nOrder 150 to start (62 now plus extras for future) = ~400 maravedís\n\n2. Commander Clasp:\n\nBronze or silver\n\nCross with decorative aureole (halo) around it\n\n\"GRANADA\" inscribed beneath\n\nAureole represents holiness, divine favor, distinguishes officers as bearing greater responsibility before God\n\n50-100 maravedís each\n\nOrder 10 initially = ~800 maravedís\n\nFor: Juan, Rodrigo (acting captain), García (sergeant), Sir Thomas, Marco (training sergeant), future squadron leaders\n\n3. Supreme Commander Clasp:\n\nFor Juan alone\n\nCraftsman's inspiration for design\n\nMost ornate and beautiful\n\nSymbolizes ultimate authority\n\nRationale for \"Granada\" on All:\n\nJuan insisted all clasps say \"GRANADA\" rather than different inscriptions:\n\nMakes them look unified\n\nWhen Granada is taken, crusade ends\n\nClasps can be returned\n\nNot permanent decoration but symbol of active service\n\nThe clasp doesn't mark \"I served\" but \"I am serving\"\n\nWhen mission complete, return it\n\nCrusade defines identity, not other way around\n\nFray Hernando's Response: \"Actually quite profound. These aren't permanent honors but active duty symbols. The mission itself creates the meaning.\"\n\nSpecial Chaplain Clasps\n\nJuan's Vision:\n\nChaplains fall outside normal command structure, answer directly to Church/God. Made promise to Pope to uphold Christian virtues. No commander may order them away or bar entrance or hold against will.\n\nDesign:\n\nBook instead of cross (representing Scripture, learning, spiritual authority)\n\n\"GRANADA\" beneath it\n\nSilver imaging (more valuable than iron, shows importance, but different from commanders' bronze/silver crosses)\n\nIndependent authority symbol\n\nFray Hernando's Response:\n\nDeeply moved: \"That's extraordinarily thoughtful. A book instead of cross - representing Scripture, learning, spiritual authority. And protection you're granting - that's rare. Most crusades treat chaplains as servants of commanders. You're making us independent voices for conscience and virtue.\"\n\n\"Shows Pope and Church hierarchy you're serious about spiritual oversight. Not just using crusade bull as military authorization but honoring its intent.\"\n\nPractical Effect:\n\nChaplains can:\n\nEnter any part of camp\n\nSpeak to any soldier\n\nReport directly to Fray Hernando or Rome if needed\n\nNo commander can stop them\n\nThis keeps officers honest - harder to hide abuses.\n\nOrders Placed:\n\n10 chaplain clasps with book symbol, silver, \"GRANADA\"\n\n1 special Papal Legate clasp (gold or silver-gold, book symbol, most ornate)\n\nTotal Clasp Orders:\n\n150 common iron: ~400 maravedís\n\n10 commander bronze/silver: ~800 maravedís\n\n1 supreme commander: ~200 maravedís\n\n10 chaplain silver: ~500 maravedís\n\n1 papal legate gold/silver: ~300 maravedís\n\nTotal: ~2,200 maravedís\n\nDiego's Mission:\n\nSecretary to carry all specifications to Seville in one week, giving craftsmen 6-7 weeks before Royal Council for quality work.\n\nMEETING THE EXEMPLARY CRUSADERS (August 28, Very Late Night)\n\nThe Eight Leaders Summoned\n\nBased on Rodrigo and Fray Hernando's assessments, Juan called meeting with most promising crusaders:\n\nFrom Military Perspective (Rodrigo's choices):\n\nMarco Tornesi - First four, exceptional training sergeant, best soldier after Sir Thomas\n\nAlonso Fernández - Day 3 recruit, age 26, former man-at-arms, professional soldier, could be officer\n\nPedro Álvarez - Day 5 recruit, age 32, border skirmishes veteran, rough but experienced\n\nAndrea Vescovi - First four, farm boy, raw but learns fast, works hard, men like him\n\nFrom Spiritual Perspective (Fray Hernando's choices):\n\nBrother Guillem - Day 7, Benedictine monk age 28, educated, devout, handles weapons well, men seek his counsel\n\nGiovanni Rossi - First four, blacksmith, simple but profound faith, prays more than anyone, spiritual anchor\n\nTomás Garcia - Day 4, age 23, converso family, passionate about proving faith, asks theological questions\n\nPietro Aldobrandini - First four, merchant's son, maturing faith, talks to young recruits about being soldier of Christ\n\nPlus:\nMiguel Cardona (Sir Thomas's addition) - Day 9, age 24, Pere de Cardona's nephew, minor nobility, well-trained, didn't have to join but did, strengthens Cardona family ties\n\nThe Meeting\n\nSetting: Small palace hall with long table, windows overlooking garden, less formal than throne room.\n\nThe Eight: Arrived in new white tabards with red crosses (first batch finished). Nervous, honored, uncertain why summoned.\n\nJuan's Opening:\n\n\"At ease soldiers. We are among brothers. I have summoned you because we feel you are setting example we are looking for in our crusade. I want to inform you of plans and hear from you how things are and what I can do to address problems you see.\"\n\nThe Briefing:\n\nStaying Barcelona a few weeks more\n\nThen sail for Seville\n\nTime used to properly equip and train everyone\n\nIn Seville crusade begins in earnest\n\nDozens now, will need thousands to complete crusade\n\nCurrent group is core and start of crusading force\n\nMust guard piety and right heart even when expanding\n\nThey should be example to new recruits, guide them\n\n\"Now, that was my talk. Tell me, how are you and our men?\"\n\nThe Crusaders' Reports\n\nMarco (mercenary):\n\"Men are good. Morale high. They believe in what we're doing - rare. But nervous. Many never fought real battle. They drill well but know drilling isn't bleeding. When we get to Granada, when it's real, they'll need steady leadership.\"\n\nAlonso (professional soldier):\n\"Equipment arriving helps - men feel more like soldiers with proper gear. But grumbling about tabards. Some recognize Templar colors. Most don't care but few worry - Templars dissolved, accused of heresy. They ask if we're trying to bring them back.\"\n\nBrother Guillem (monk):\n\"I've told them Templars fell because of pride and corruption, not because crusading was wrong. Your emphasis on mercy and confession shows we're learning from their mistakes. Most accept that.\"\n\nGiovanni (blacksmith):\n\"I pray with men every night. They have good hearts. Want to serve God. But some don't understand protecting Muslims who surrender. They say 'Why fight them if we're just going to protect them?' They think crusade means killing all infidels.\"\n\nFray Hernando: \"I've been addressing this in instruction but it's hardest concept. They understand fighting, conversion, but mercy toward enemies requires constant reinforcement.\"\n\nAndrea (farm boy):\nNervously: \"Men also ask when do we get paid? Some came with money but others running low. They know you'll feed and house us but...\"\n\nPedro (border veteran):\nClarified: \"Not complaining. But soldiers need to know terms. Will there be regular wages? Plunder rights? Share of ransoms? These matter to men with families.\"\n\nPietro (merchant's son):\n\"But Your Majesty, despite questions, men love you. When you walk through training yard, they stand straighter. They want to prove worthy. Andrea's right some worry about money, but more worry about disappointing you.\"\n\nMiguel Cardona (nobleman):\n\"One more thing. Some men wonder about status after crusade. If we take Granada, if we survive - do we go home? Garrison conquered territory? Become permanent order like Santiago or Calatrava? Men want to know if this is campaign or lifetime commitment.\"\n\nJuan's Response\n\nOn Mercy for Muslims:\n\n\"I may have sowed confusion when I mentioned mercy. We carry swords to fight them - that's primary purpose. But we do so out of purpose, not bloodlust. There's time for holy fury and time for Virgin Mary's mercy. Maybe this distinction is something more developed crusader should aspire to.\"\n\n\"Job of normal soldier is to follow orders and fight with all might when required. Developing this should be focus. Maybe focus better spent on other areas, especially in new recruits.\"\n\nOn Templar Colors:\n\n\"Red cross almost same as Knights Templar, a coincidence. Explain this when needed.\"\n\nOn Payment:\n\n\"I understand pay issue. Moment crusade complete, entire lands of Granada fall to me. I will divide these lands among faithful crusaders and Church. I have not calculated exact amount but expect reward substantial. I will provide clarity.\"\n\nThen asked: \"Men want pay while on crusade. Why do they need pay? I provide arms, food, shelter. What pay would they need?\"\n\nThe Explanations:\n\nMarco: \"Soldiers have families. Wives, children, parents who depend on them. If man away for years fighting, someone needs to feed his family. Without wages to send back, wife and children starve.\"\n\nPedro: \"Things soldiers need that aren't provided. Man wants to write letter home - needs coin for scribe. Boots wear out beyond repair - needs new ones. Wants to buy charm for wife or medicine for sick child. Small things but they matter.\"\n\nAlonso: \"In most armies, soldiers expect regular pay even when fed and housed. It's tradition, how they measure worth. Man who serves for nothing but eventual reward feels like servant, not soldier. Pay gives dignity.\"\n\nMiguel: \"Promise of Granada's lands valuable. But uncertain - men don't know what they'll receive or when. Monthly wage, even small, gives them something concrete while they wait for larger reward.\"\n\nBrother Guillem: \"I took vows of poverty. I need no coin. But these men didn't. They have worldly responsibilities not sinful - caring for family is Christian duty. Perhaps small stipend? Enough to send home monthly, keep families from destitution?\"\n\nAndrea: \"My mother remarried so I don't have family to support. But some men here worry. They want to serve you but don't want children hungry.\"\n\nWage Discussion\n\nSir Thomas: \"In English and French armies, common archer or man-at-arms receives about 6 pence per day (4-5 maravedís) when on campaign. But that's when they provide own food and lodging.\"\n\nMarco: \"As mercenary I've been paid 3-8 maravedís daily depending on campaign. But again, feeding myself.\"\n\nAlonso: \"Since you're providing arms, food, shelter, equipment, pay could be lower. Perhaps 2 maravedís per day for common crusaders? That's 60 maravedís monthly - enough to send home to keep family fed, not lavish.\"\n\nRodrigo: \"62 crusaders now, that's 124 maravedís daily, about 3,720 per month. When we reach hundreds or thousands, costs grow substantially.\"\n\nSir Thomas: \"Officers and specialists should earn more. Sergeant perhaps 4 maravedís daily, captain 8-10. Skilled men like smiths or engineers even more.\"\n\nPedro: \"Soldiers also expect bonus for victories. When we take city, usually plunder rights or one-time payment. Separate from regular wages but important for morale.\"\n\nDiego's Financial Breakdown:\n\nCurrent treasury:\n\n82,000 florins from Barcelona = ~21,730,000 maravedís\n\n20,000 florins from Pope = ~5,300,000 maravedís\n\n60,000 florins from Florence = ~15,900,000 maravedís\n\nTotal: ~162,000 florins or ~42,930,000 maravedís\n\nExchange rate: 1 florin = ~265 maravedís\n\nPayroll projections at 60 maravedís/month:\n\nCurrent 62: 3,720 monthly\n\n500 crusaders: 30,000 monthly\n\n2,000 crusaders: 120,000 monthly\n\n5,000 crusaders: 300,000 monthly (3.6 million annually = 12% of royal revenue)\n\nSir Thomas: \"Wage actually one of smaller costs. Equipment, supplies, siege engines, fortifications, horses cost much more.\"\n\nCurrent treasury could pay 5,000 crusaders for almost a year. But with crusade taxation authorized, should have ongoing revenue.\n\nTHE WAGE ANNOUNCEMENT CEREMONY (August 28, Final Scene)\n\nAssembly of the Crusaders\n\nJuan ordered: \"Assemble the troops. Everyone under banner of crusade. I have announcement to make.\"\n\nDiego: \"200 maravedís per crusader. I'll have it counted.\" Hurried off to prepare 12,400 maravedís total.\n\nRodrigo: \"I'll gather everyone. Ten minutes.\" Called out: \"All crusaders! Assembly in main courtyard! Full company, now!\"\n\nThe Formation:\n\nWithin minutes, all 62 crusaders streamed into courtyard:\n\nSome from training, barracks, prayer\n\nFormed rough ranks in white tabards with red crosses\n\nCurious and slightly anxious\n\nGarcía and guards positioned at intervals. Sir Thomas and Fray Hernando took positions.\n\nDiego returned with heavy chest and two guards - treasury funds.\n\nCourtyard quiet except for distant Barcelona sounds and fountain trickling.\n\nJuan's Speech\n\n\"Soldiers of Christ,\n\nYou have answered the call. You have taken pledge before this holy banner and before almighty God. And you have placed faith and trust in crusade and me that you will be provided for. You have pledged service without discussing pay or demanding any. I will address this issue right now and repay your faith.\n\nEvery soldier of Christ will be paid 2 maravedís per day or 60 maravedís per month. You already know you pledged service for as long as it takes to take all of Granada. Moment we complete crusade, I will divide lands among faithful Christians. Crusaders will be among first to be rewarded. I will let you know later how much.\n\nYou have all come here, some with possessions, others with only body and soul. A soldier makes sure he is adequately clothed and ready. I will give every crusader one-time payment of 200 maravedís so everyone can buy warm cloak, good pair of boots, or do whatever they want with it. This is one-time payment only. After one month, you shall all receive 60.\n\nDiego, our treasurer, will now pay you all. Accept these payments and spend them wisely.\"\n\nThe Response\n\nMoment of stunned silence.\n\nThen Marco's voice rang out: \"LONG LIVE THE KING!\"\n\nEntire company erupted: \"LONG LIVE THE KING! LONG LIVE THE CRUSADE!\"\n\nSome shouting, some weeping openly, some dropping to knees in prayer\n\nAndrea crying, young face overwhelmed\n\nGiovanni clutching rosary, tears streaming\n\nPietro grinning ear to ear\n\nEven veterans like Alonso and Pedro looked moved\n\nMiguel Cardona genuinely impressed\n\nBrother Guillem made sign of cross, bowed head in thanks\n\nThe Payment:\n\nDiego: \"Form a line! One at a time, state name clearly!\"\n\nMen organized quickly, excitement barely contained.\n\nOne by one approached, stated names, received 200 maravedís (substantial sum). Each man:\n\nClutched payment like treasure\n\nMany made sign of cross\n\nSome bowed deeply to Juan\n\nComments heard:\n\n\"God bless you, Your Majesty\"\n\n\"I'll fight to death for you, sire\"\n\n\"My family will eat this winter\" (voice breaking)\n\nThe Aftermath:\n\nAfter all received payment:\n\nMen gathered in small groups\n\nCounting and recounting money\n\nDiscussing what they'd buy, making plans\n\nEnergy electric - gratitude, loyalty, fierce determination radiating\n\nFray Hernando watched with satisfaction. Sir Thomas nodded approvingly - extraordinary loyalty bought for modest sum.\n\nThe 62 crusaders stood in courtyard:\n\nWhite tabards gleaming\n\nCoins in hands\n\nEyes on Juan with devotion beyond mere duty\n\nSTATUS AT CHAPTER END (August 28, 1430, Night)\n\nPolitical Achievements\n\nIn Barcelona:\n\n82,000 florins raised in donations\n\n62 crusaders recruited and sworn\n\nArchbishop of Zaragoza actively supporting\n\nConsell Reial granted safe passage and support\n\nThree major Catalan families pledged backing\n\nLetter going to Alfonso V in Naples\n\nReputation in Aragon transformed\n\nIn Castile (via Intelligence):\n\nInfantes' rebellion failed completely\n\nÁlvaro de Luna held kingdom successfully\n\nAll major cities remained loyal\n\nInfantes exposed as rebels but not destroyed\n\nCaptain Fernán en route with arrest orders\n\nMilitary Status\n\nCurrent Force:\n\n62 sworn crusaders\n\nQuality: 12 experienced, 31 competent, 15 raw but promising\n\nAll passed spiritual screening\n\nTraining ongoing under Rodrigo, García, Sir Thomas, Marco\n\nEquipment being procured\n\nExperienced Core:\n\nRodrigo (acting captain)\n\nGarcía (sergeant)\n\nSir Thomas (military advisor)\n\nMarco (training sergeant)\n\nTotal: 4 experienced commanders plus Juan\n\nResources\n\nTreasury:\n\n162,000 florins total (42,930,000 maravedís)\n\nFrom: Barcelona (82,000), Pope (20,000), Florence (60,000)\n\nSacred Items:\n\nPapal crusade bull with authentication\n\nFragment of True Cross in gold reliquary\n\nBone of Saint James in silver reliquary\n\nFather's sword (Non Nobis Domine)\n\nWhite banner with reliquaries mounted\n\nEquipment Orders Placed:\n\n62 white tabards with red crosses\n\n62 shields (white with red cross)\n\nWeapons and armor for recruits\n\n150 common iron clasps\n\n10 commander bronze/silver clasps\n\n1 supreme commander clasp\n\n10 chaplain silver clasps\n\n1 papal legate gold clasp\n\nPlans Finalized\n\nNext Three Weeks in Barcelona:\n\nContinue training crusaders\n\nComplete equipment procurement\n\nFray Hernando recruit 2-3 more chaplains\n\nGather intelligence about sea routes\n\nBuild support with remaining nobles\n\nDeparture (Mid-September):\n\nHire three ships for security\n\nBanner and four guards stay together on flagship\n\nSail to Seville (8-10 day voyage)\n\nArrive late September\n\nRoyal Council:\n\nNovember 8, 1430 in Seville\n\nPresent crusade bull publicly\n\nAward clasps to all crusaders\n\nConfront Infantes from position of strength\n\nLaunch crusade officially\n\nPersonal Developments\n\nIsabel Crisis Resolved:\n\nJuan fell deeply in love with Isabel Ruiz (converso merchant's daughter)\n\nNearly made disastrous decision to tell her he loved her but couldn't be with her\n\nFray Hernando intervened, showed this was selfish cruelty dressed as duty\n\nJuan recognized he was wrong - first time his \"certainty\" proved false\n\nMeeting cancelled, crisis averted\n\nLearned valuable lesson about distinguishing conviction from divine guidance\n\nRelationships:\n\nSister María: Warm, supportive, protective, facilitating and warning\n\nFray Hernando: Trusted confessor willing to challenge king when necessary\n\nRodrigo: Growing into captain role, proving capable\n\nEight exemplary crusaders: Beginning to form leadership core\n\nUnresolved Threads\n\nCaptain Fernán's Mission:\n\nRiding to Castile with arrest orders for Infantes\n\nWill arrive early September\n\nCould trigger civil war or force submission\n\nOutcome uncertain\n\nGranada's Preparations:\n\nPossible naval activity in Mediterranean\n\nNeed intelligence before choosing route\n\nUnknown level of military readiness\n\nIsabel:\n\nJuan still loves her\n\nShe likely has feelings for him\n\nNothing resolved, just avoided immediate crisis\n\nWill they encounter each other again?\n\nThe Papal Legate:\n\nNot yet appointed\n\nWill join crusade with spiritual oversight authority\n\nUnknown who Pope will send\n\nTHEMES ESTABLISHED IN CHAPTER 5\n\nCertainty and Discernment\n\nJuan's crisis about his five moments of certainty - and realizing one was wrong - creates ongoing tension about distinguishing divine guidance from personal conviction. Learning to question even his certainties is path to wisdom.\n\nLove and Duty\n\nThe Isabel situation introduces romantic complication Juan can't simply resolve through willpower. His heart doesn't obey political calculations. The question of whether love and duty can coexist remains unresolved.\n\nBuilding an Army\n\nTransforming from small company to actual military force. The practical work of training, equipping, paying, and spiritually forming crusaders. Creating something that blends military effectiveness with Christian virtue.\n\nIdentity and Symbolism\n\nThe white tabards with red crosses, the Non Nobis Domine war cry, the clasp system - all building distinctive crusader identity that reclaims Templar legacy while emphasizing mercy and justice.\n\nYouth Learning Leadership\n\nJuan continues making mistakes, recognizing them, adjusting. His willingness to admit \"I was wrong\" and change course is strength, not weakness. But also learning what decisions to commit to versus reconsider.\n\nFamily and Isolation\n\nMaría's support provides crucial anchor - someone who knows Juan as person, not just king. But also reminder of how isolated kingship can be, how few people one can truly trust.\n\nFaith and Politics Intertwined\n\nContinuing exploration of how genuine religious devotion coexists with calculated political strategy. Juan's honesty about mixing motivations makes him more credible than those claiming pure piety.\n\nLOOKING AHEAD TO CHAPTER 6\n\nThree Weeks in Barcelona:\n\nFinal training and preparation\n\nPotential complications from staying in Alfonso's city too long\n\nMore recruitment and fundraising opportunities\n\nBuilding relationships with Catalan nobility\n\nFray Hernando recruiting chaplain corps\n\nThe Journey to Seville:\n\nMultiple ships for security\n\nPossible naval encounters\n\nArrival in Castile after months away\n\nReunion with Álvaro de Luna\n\nLearning outcome of Infantes' arrest orders\n\nThe Royal Council:\n\nNovember 8, 1430 in Seville\n\nPublic presentation of crusade bull\n\nConfrontation with Infantes (if not arrested)\n\nUniting nobility behind crusade\n\nFirst major test of whether Castile will follow\n\nThe Crusade Begins:\n\nTransition from preparation to actual campaign\n\nRecruiting thousands more crusaders\n\nMilitary planning for Granada conquest\n\nDealing with Granada's diplomatic mission (if it arrives)\n\nDiscovering Granada's unexpected strength from Muslim world support\n\nChapter 5 concludes with Juan having learned crucial lesson about certainty and humility, having narrowly avoided personal disaster, and having successfully built foundation in Barcelona for his crusade. The young king continues to grow - sometimes through mistakes, always through willingness to listen and adapt. The journey to Seville and the Royal Council await.",
