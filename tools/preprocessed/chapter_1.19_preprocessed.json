      "text": "- Date: May 10, 1431, Dawn\n- Juan has just arrived before Granada's western walls with 10,000 troops\n- He captured a courier and learned that Sultan Muhammad IX is planning a sortie/ambush with 2,500-3,000 troops\n- The Castilians have prepared a counter-trap: 1,000 flanking infantry hidden in position, main forces deployed\n- Juan is now riding up to the gates with a 300-man escort to challenge the Sultan\n- The Sultan plans to launch a massive sortie when Juan approaches with his small escort to try to kill/capture him\n- But the Castilians KNOW about this plan and have prepared a counter-ambush\n\nNow Juan is riding up, removing his helmet, and loudly challenging the Sultan. This is incredibly bold and risky - he's putting himself in danger to provoke the Sultan into springing the trap.\n\nThis is the kind of action that requires a roll because:\n1. It has uncertain outcomes\n2. It involves risk (personal danger to Juan)\n3. The Sultan's response could vary\n4. The effectiveness of the provocation matters\n\nI need to:\n1. Set up the scene - describe Juan approaching with his 300 men\n2. Evaluate the factors (pros and cons)\n3. Create a custom d100 table for the Sultan's response/how this plays out\n4. Wait for the player to roll\n\nLet me think about the factors:\n\nPROS (Factors in Juan's favor):\n- Bold, dramatic gesture that appeals to honor culture\n- Sultan is already planning to sortie - this aligns with his intentions\n- Psychological impact of king personally challenging sultan\n- Castilian trap is well-prepared\n- Hidden flanking force ready\n- Main army deployed and ready\n- Recent victories have given Castilians confidence\n- Sultan's forces are demoralized from previous defeats\n- Juan is visible, identifiable target - hard for Sultan to resist\n\n- Timing is strategically perfect, catching the enemy at dawn when they're least prepared\n\nCONS (Factors against):\n- Extreme personal vulnerability with just 300 men\n- Potential miscalculation of enemy's actual strength\n- Risk of appearing recklessly overconfident\n- Possibility of strategic backfire if trap fails\n- Unpredictability of Sultan's tactical response\n- Geographical disadvantage within enemy territory\n- Potential for unexpected counterstrategies\n- Cultural misunderstandings could derail the entire plan\n\nThe Sultan's potential unconventional reaction introduces significant uncertainty into the tactical approach, challenging standard military engagement protocols.\n\nPerfect! Now I have all the details I need. The trap is set, the forces are in position:\n\n- 300 heavy cavalry escort with Juan (50 Guardian Company elite, 150 Calatrava heavy cavalry, 100 veteran frontier horsemen)\n- Captain Fernán commanding immediate household guard\n- Sergeant García and Corporal Rodrigo flanking Juan\n- 1,000 flanking infantry hidden (500 north, 500 south, led by Don Rodrigo de Perea)\n- 2,500 light cavalry ready for rapid response\n- 1,500 heavy cavalry under Don Fadrique for the decisive blow\n- 4,500 main infantry for reinforcement\n- Don Fadrique commanding the overall cavalry response\n\nThe Sultan has 2,500-3,000 troops assembled behind the western gate, waiting to spring what he thinks is an ambush.\n\nNow Juan is riding up, helmet off, shouting challenges at the Sultan. This is the moment of truth. I need to evaluate and create the roll table.\n\nCHAPTER 19: THE CHALLENGE\n\nDawn, May 10, 1431 - Before Granada's Western Gate\n\nThe sun climbed above the Sierra Nevada, flooding the Vega de Granada with honey-gold light. Irrigation channels glittered like silver threads across the green fields. In the distance, Granada rose against the mountains—white walls, red towers, the Alhambra's fortress complex sprawling across its hill. From minarets across the city, the call to fajr prayer drifted through the morning air, hauntingly beautiful even to Christian ears.\n\nBut this morning, prayer competed with war drums.\n\nYour army stretched across the plain in battle formation—ten thousand men deployed with the precision of months of campaigning. Infantry in the center, cavalry on the flanks, banners streaming in the morning breeze. The great crusade standard hung beside your position, the red cross vivid against white silk. Somewhere out in the fields, invisible among irrigation channels and olive groves, Don Rodrigo de Perea's thousand infantry lay hidden after seven cold hours of silence.\n\nThe trap was set. The Sultan thought he would spring an ambush. He had no idea you'd read his sealed orders.\n\nYou turned to your commanders gathered around you—the Master of Calatrava, Don Fadrique Enríquez, Captain Fernán, Sergeant García, Corporal Rodrigo. Three hundred heavy cavalry assembled behind you, the finest troops in your army. Fifty Guardian Company knights in their distinctive armor. One hundred fifty Calatrava cavalry, seasoned crusaders. One hundred frontier veterans who knew desperate fighting.\n\n\"Ready?\" you asked simply.\n\nCaptain Fernán checked your armor one final time. White-painted steel, perfect fit, every strap secured. White surcoat with the red cross. Your father's sword at your hip: Non Nobis Domine, Sed Nomini Tuo Da Gloriam. \"Ready, Your Majesty.\"\n\nGarcía moved to your left side, Rodrigo to your right. Their positions. Always.\n\nThe Master of Calatrava clasped your shoulder briefly. \"God be with you, Your Majesty. We'll be right behind you.\"\n\nYou nodded, lowered the visor on your helmet, then thought better of it. You wanted them to see your face. You wanted the Sultan to know exactly who stood before his gates.\n\nYou removed the helmet entirely, handing it to a squire. Your hair caught the morning light.\n\n\"Forward,\" you commanded.\n\nThree hundred horsemen moved across the plain toward Granada. Not at a charge, but at a measured walk—deliberate, controlled, inexorable. Hoofbeats rumbled like distant thunder. Mail jingled. Horses snorted in the morning cool. The crusade banner rippled overhead.\n\nBehind you, your main army held position. Watching. Waiting.\n\nAhead, Granada's western wall loomed larger with each stride. Thirty feet of stone and mortar, crenellations bristling with defenders. You could see them now—hundreds of men crowded along the ramparts, pointing, shouting. Sunlight glinted off spear points and helmets. Archers nocked arrows but held them, waiting for orders.\n\nThe gate itself was massive—iron-reinforced timber, large enough for siege engines. And you knew what waited behind it. Twenty-five hundred to three thousand troops, assembled in the streets, officers briefed, weapons ready. Waiting for you to come within range. Waiting for the signal.\n\nThey think they're about to spring a trap.\n\nYou urged your horse forward, ahead of your escort. García and Rodrigo stayed close, but you moved into clear space where everyone could see you. Three hundred feet from the gate. Two hundred fifty. Two hundred.\n\nArrows could reach you now. You were within effective crossbow range. Your men shifted nervously, but held formation. They trusted you. They'd follow you into hell itself.\n\nYou reined in at roughly three hundred feet. Your escort fanned out into a loose arc behind you, a wall of steel and horseflesh. The crusade banner streamed in the wind.\n\nFor a moment, silence hung over the battlefield. Ten thousand Castilians watching from the plain. Thousands of Moors watching from the walls. The city holding its breath.\n\nYou stood in your stirrups, drew your father's sword, and raised it toward the gate. Your voice, trained by months of battlefield commands, carried clearly across the open ground:\n\n\"SULTAN MUHAMMAD! I, JUAN, BY THE GRACE OF GOD KING OF CASTILE, HAVE COME TO YOUR GATES TO FACE YOU, INFIDEL, AND DEMAND YOUR SURRENDER! SHOW YOURSELF BEFORE THESE SOLDIERS OF CHRIST!\"\n\nYour voice echoed off the walls. Somewhere inside, you knew, the Sultan heard. His vizier heard. His commanders heard. Every man assembled in those streets behind the gate heard the Christian king challenging their master at his own threshold.\n\nYou began riding slowly in tight circles before your escort, keeping your sword raised, visible to every defender on the walls:\n\n\"COME OUT AND FACE ME, COWARD! OR DO YOU HIDE BEHIND STONE WHILE BRAVER MEN WATCH? THE ARMY OF CHRIST STANDS BEFORE YOUR GATES! GOD HAS JUDGED BETWEEN US, AND YOU HAVE BEEN FOUND WANTING!\"\n\nSomewhere on the walls, a commotion. Figures moving. Arguing, perhaps. The Sultan's standard—green silk with golden Arabic script—flew from a tower near the gate.\n\nYou circled again, your white armor gleaming in the sunlight, impossible to miss:\n\n\"YOU CALLED FOR JIHAD, AND GOD ANSWERED—WITH YOUR ARMY'S DESTRUCTION AT ALCALÁ! YOU THOUGHT TO STAND AGAINST CHRIST'S ANOINTED, AND TEN THOUSAND OF YOUR MEN LIE DEAD! NOW I STAND AT YOUR THRESHOLD! WILL YOU HIDE LIKE A WOMAN, OR WILL YOU ANSWER LIKE A MAN?\"\n\nThe personal insult. In both Christian and Moorish culture, devastating. No sultan could ignore such a challenge at his own gates, before his own troops, before his own people.\n\nBehind you, your three hundred cavalry sat motionless, a steel wall. Farther back, your main army waited. And hidden in the fields, invisible to Granada's defenders, a thousand infantry lay ready.\n\nThe gate remained closed. But on the walls, the commotion was growing. Men shouting. Officers gesturing. And somewhere inside, you knew, the Sultan was making his decision.\n\nGM Evaluation: The Challenge's Effectiveness\n\nThis is a critical moment requiring a roll. The Sultan's response will determine how the battle unfolds.\n\nFACTORS IN YOUR FAVOR (Pros):\n\nCalculated provocation perfectly executed: The challenge directly targets the Sultan's honor before his entire court, army, and populace—unbearable pressure in honor-based culture\n\nIntelligence advantage: You know he's assembled the sortie force; this provocation aligns perfectly with his existing intentions\n\nTactical preparation: Counter-trap is expertly prepared with hidden flanking infantry, rapid-response cavalry, and overwhelming force in depth\n\nPsychological momentum: Fresh from devastating victory at Alcalá (10,000 enemy dead), your army's confidence is sky-high while Granada is demoralized\n\nPersonal boldness: Removing helmet, exposing yourself to danger—this isn't empty rhetoric but genuine courage visible to all\n\nCultural understanding: The specific insults (\"hide like a woman,\" \"coward,\" questioning his manhood) strike at core values that transcend Christian/Muslim divide\n\nTiming: Sultan has already committed to the sortie plan; this makes it almost impossible for him to back down without losing face\n\nVisual impact: White armor, crusade banner, three hundred elite cavalry—magnificent and intimidating display\n\nStrategic symbolism: Christian king at Muslim sultan's gates in heart of his own kingdom—historic, memorable moment\n\nRecent defeats: Granada has lost every major engagement; Sultan desperately needs a victory to restore credibility\n\nFACTORS AGAINST YOU (Cons):\n\nExtreme personal danger: You're within effective missile range with limited cover; a lucky arrow or crossbow bolt could end the crusade\n\nNumerical disadvantage at contact point: 300 escort vs. 2,500-3,000 sortie force—initial odds are terrible\n\nPossible trap suspicion: Some of Sultan's advisors might smell a counter-trap and counsel caution\n\nGate bottleneck unpredictability: Deployment through gate will take time, potentially allowing phased withdrawal before full commitment\n\nSultan's desperation: He might refuse to engage, choosing to preserve forces rather than risk another defeat\n\nCultural differences: Sultan might not respond to European-style honor challenge exactly as expected\n\nHome advantage: Granadan forces know terrain intimately, have walls at back for retreat, familiar ground\n\nAlternative responses possible: Sultan could use wall-mounted artillery/crossbows instead of sortie, or wait you out\n\nCUSTOM D100 TABLE: SULTAN'S RESPONSE\n\n1-5: Catastrophic Refusal\nSultan recognizes trap and absolutely refuses to engage. Keeps gates closed, shouts defiance from walls but takes no action. Your challenge falls flat, making the dramatic approach look foolish. Must proceed with countryside devastation plan without the battle. Massive loss of face, though no casualties.\n\n6-18: Cautious Defensive Response\nSultan deploys defensive forces only—archers, crossbowmen concentrate fire on your position from walls. Perhaps 300-500 troops emerge cautiously but don't fully commit. You take casualties (30-60 men) withdrawing but avoid disaster. Sortie force stays mostly uncommitted. Minor engagement, tactical draw.\n\n19-35: Partial Sortie, Controlled Engagement\nSultan sends out 1,200-1,500 troops (half his force) to test your strength while keeping remainder in reserve. Disciplined, measured response. Battle ensues but not the overwhelming commitment you hoped for. Your counter-trap still works but less decisively. Moderate Castilian victory, 200-400 enemy casualties, you take 80-150 casualties. Sultan preserves core of force.\n\n36-55: Standard Sortie as Planned\nSultan responds as his original plan dictated—refuses from walls, then launches full 2,500-3,000 troop sortie. Your counter-trap executes as designed. Flanking infantry emerges, cavalry responds in phases, you drive them back. Solid Castilian victory. 800-1,200 Granadan casualties, your forces take 150-300 casualties. Sultan's sortie force defeated but not destroyed. Clear tactical success.\n\n56-72: Strong Commitment, Trap Springs Perfectly\nSultan takes the bait completely. Full sortie launches with excellent coordination, but your counter-trap execution is flawless. Hidden infantry appears precisely on time, cavalry hammer blow is devastating. Major Castilian victory. 1,400-1,900 Granadan casualties including many officers, your casualties 180-320. Sultan's sortie force shattered. Significant impact on Granada's will to resist.\n\n73-85: Overcommitment Driven by Rage\nPersonal insults drive Sultan to abandon caution. He commits not just the sortie force but additional reserves (3,200-3,800 troops total), perhaps even leads personally or sends key commanders. Your trap becomes a massacre. Overwhelming Castilian victory. 2,000-2,800 enemy casualties, possibly including high-value prisoners. Your casualties 200-400. Granada's military capacity severely damaged.\n\n86-94: Near-Total Destruction\nSultan's rage and desperation lead to catastrophic overcommitment. Nearly 4,000 troops pour through the gate in waves, discipline breaks down in fury to reach you. Your counter-trap achieves near-perfect execution. Enemy force routed with devastating casualties: 2,800-3,500 killed, hundreds captured including commanders. Your casualties 220-450. Granada's field force essentially destroyed. Political crisis in city probable.\n\n95-100: The Sultan's Downfall\nComplete disaster for Granada. Sultan either leads personally (and is killed/captured) or his sortie force is annihilated so thoroughly that political consequences are immediate. 3,200-4,000+ enemy casualties, mass rout, potential capture of Sultan or key members of royal family/court. Your casualties 250-500. Granada's capacity to resist field battles completely broken. Possible surrender negotiations within days. Campaign potentially shortened by months. Historic crushing victory.\n\nPlease roll your d100 and report the result.",

Then, ONCE we know what he does, we roll for how SUCCESSFUL that response is\n\nSo I need to create a d100 table that's purely about the Sultan's decision/response type, not the outcome of that response.\n\nLet me create a proper table focused on Sultan's decision only.\n\nYou're absolutely right. I apologize for both issues:\n\nI should NEVER generate Juan's dialogue or actions. I'll narrate only up to the point where you need to act, then stop.\n\nThe roll should determine the Sultan's RESPONSE type only, then we assess success separately.\n\nLet me create a proper response table:\n\nCUSTOM D100 TABLE: SULTAN'S RESPONSE TO CHALLENGE\n\nFACTORS IN FAVOR (Pros):\n\nDirect challenge to honor before his entire court/army/populace (unbearable pressure)\n\nSultan already planned sortie - this aligns with existing intentions\n\nRecent defeats create desperate need to show strength\n\nCultural imperative to respond to such public insults\n\nYou're exposed with only 300 men - appears vulnerable\n\nFACTORS AGAINST (Cons):\n\nRisk of another catastrophic defeat\n\nSome advisors might suspect trap\n\nPreserving forces is rational alternative\n\nCould use walls/missiles instead of sortie\n\nPrevious disasters might counsel extreme caution\n\n1-3: Absolute Refusal, Gate Stays Closed\nSultan refuses entirely. No sortie, no engagement. Shouts defiance from walls but takes no military action. Complete rejection of challenge.\n\n4-8: Missile Response Only\nSultan orders concentrated crossbow/arrow fire from walls at your position. No troops emerge. Defensive response using fortification advantage.\n\n9-15: Token Response\nSultan sends 200-400 troops out to \"show presence\" but with orders not to fully engage. Face-saving gesture without real commitment.\n\n16-28: Partial Sortie - Conservative\nSultan deploys 1,000-1,500 troops (about half his assembled force). Keeps substantial reserve. Measured, cautious engagement.\n\n29-45: Partial Sortie - Moderate\nDeploys 1,500-2,000 troops. Commits majority of force but retains some reserve inside gates. Serious engagement but not all-in.\n\n46-65: Full Sortie As Originally Planned\nLaunches complete sortie force of 2,500-3,000 troops as his plan dictated. Full commitment of prepared forces but nothing beyond that.\n\n66-80: Full Sortie Plus Reserves\nCommits sortie force PLUS additional troops from garrison - 3,000-3,500 total. Goes beyond original plan due to rage/desperation.\n\n81-91: Massive Overcommitment\nSultan commits 3,500-4,200 troops - stripping city garrison dangerously. Personal insults drive abandonment of caution.\n\n92-97: Reckless Total Commitment\nNearly entire available force - 4,200-5,000 troops. Sultan either leads personally or sends all senior commanders. Complete loss of strategic restraint.\n\n98-100: Catastrophic Overcommitment\nSultan leads personally with 4,500-5,500 troops, including royal guard and key court figures. Absolute maximum deployment driven by rage and desperation.\n\nPlease roll d100 for the Sultan's response.",

      "text": "Good. The player rolled 48, which means \"Full Sortie As Originally Planned\" - the Sultan commits his full 2,500-3,000 troop sortie force as his intercepted orders indicated, but nothing beyond that.\n\nNow I need to narrate up to the point where Juan sees/hears the Sultan's response. The player wants me to STOP before generating any of Juan's dialogue or actions. So I narrate:\n\n1. The waiting period under the walls\n2. The Sultan's appearance and response from the walls\n3. The moment when the gates begin to open and the sortie launches\n\nI should stop RIGHT when Juan needs to make a decision or respond. I should NOT:\n- Generate Juan's dialogue in response\n- Describe Juan's actions during the sortie\n- Have Juan give commands\n\nI narrate the world's response to his challenge, then stop when it's time for him to act again.\n\nThe Sultan would likely appear on the walls, shout defiance (this is his refusal signal that triggers the sortie), then immediately the gates open and troops pour out. This was the plan from the intercepted orders.\n\nThe Sultan's Answer\n\nYou hold position, circling slowly on your horse before your three hundred cavalry. The morning sun climbs higher, warming your armor. Your escort sits motionless behind you, a wall of steel. The crusade banner snaps in the breeze.\n\nMinutes pass. The walls remain crowded with defenders. You can see movement—messengers running, officers shouting orders, clusters of men arguing. The commotion centers around a tower near the gate where the Sultan's green standard flies.\n\nBehind you, your main army waits in perfect silence. Ten thousand men watching their king stand alone before the enemy gate.\n\nMore time. Five minutes. Ten. The tension stretches. Some of your escort shift in their saddles. Captain Fernán edges his horse slightly forward, protective.\n\nThen—movement on the tower.\n\nA figure emerges onto the rampart directly above the gate. Even at this distance, you can see the richness of his robes—green silk with gold embroidery, a white turban with a jeweled clasp. The Sultan's ceremonial armor gleams beneath the robes. Two bodyguards flank him, shields raised protectively. A third man—vizier or senior commander by his dress—stands at his shoulder.\n\nSultan Muhammad IX looks down at you. For a moment, silence hangs over the battlefield.\n\nThen his voice rings out—not in Arabic, but in Castilian. Accented, but clear enough for your men to understand:\n\n\"CHRISTIAN DOG! YOU DARE STAND AT MY GATES AND SPEAK OF SURRENDER? YOU, WHOSE GRANDFATHER DIED IN DEFEAT? WHOSE FATHER ACCOMPLISHED NOTHING? YOU ARE A BOY PLAYING AT WAR!\"\n\nThe insults are calculated, meant to wound. Around you, your men tense. García's hand moves toward his sword hilt.\n\nThe Sultan continues, his voice rising:\n\n\"YOU WANT TO FACE ME? THEN FACE THE RIGHTEOUS FURY OF ISLAM! FACE THE WARRIORS OF GRANADA WHO WILL SEND YOU TO JOIN YOUR WEAK FATHER IN HELL! ALLAH AKBAR!\"\n\nThe cry is taken up by thousands of voices on the walls: \"ALLAH AKBAR! ALLAH AKBAR!\"\n\nAnd then—\n\nThe massive gates begin to swing open.\n\nNot slowly. Not cautiously. They slam open with a boom that echoes across the plain, iron hinges shrieking. Behind them, you can see what you expected: a street packed with troops. Hundreds of men. Thousands. Infantry in the front ranks, spears leveled. Cavalry behind them, horses already moving. Moroccan troops in their distinctive armor. Officers shouting orders.\n\nThe street is a solid mass of armed men, and they're already surging forward.\n\nWar drums thunder from inside the city. Horns blare. The sortie force pours through the gate like a flood breaking through a dam—first dozens, then hundreds of troops spilling out onto the open ground before the walls. They deploy with practiced speed, infantry forming up, cavalry wheeling to the flanks.\n\nYou can see their numbers now. At least twenty-five hundred men, possibly more. The formations keep coming, streaming through that gate, officers directing them into battle order with shouts and signals.\n\nThree hundred yards separate you from that growing mass of enemy troops.\n\nBehind you, Captain Fernán's voice is urgent but controlled: \"Your Majesty—\"\n\nThe Moorish cavalry on the enemy flanks is already moving. Not charging yet, but advancing at a trot, beginning to spread wide to envelope your position. The infantry presses forward in the center, a bristling wall of spears and shields.\n\nYou can hear the shouts now—individual voices amid the roar. Officers directing troops. Men calling on God. The thunder of boots and hooves.\n\nThe sortie force continues to deploy, but the forward elements are already committed. Perhaps a thousand troops clear of the gate now, more still coming. They're moving toward you.\n\nWhat do you do?",

      "text": "Good. The user is taking the action as planned - putting on helmet when Sultan appears, then conducting fighting retreat to the predetermined rally line (700 yards from gate according to the plan in Chapter 18). The plan calls for:\n\n1. 300 cavalry escort conducts fighting retreat to rally line at 700 yards\n2. 1,000 hidden flanking infantry (500 north, 500 south) emerges when gates open and rushes to form defensive line at rally point\n3. 2,500 light cavalry charges to screen escort flanks and harass sortie deployment\n4. Then main infantry advances (4,500) and heavy cavalry (1,500) delivers hammer blow\n\nNow I need to create a d100 table for how successful this OPENING STAGE is - basically the retreat and the emergence of the flanking infantry and light cavalry response. This is NOT the whole battle, just this first phase.\n\nFactors in favor:\n- Plan is well-rehearsed\n- Troops know their roles\n- 700 yards is manageable retreat distance\n- Hidden infantry has been in position for 7+ hours, disciplined\n- Light cavalry is ready and positioned\n- Enemy must deploy through gate bottleneck\n- Terrain chosen in advance\n- Clear command structure\n\nFactors against:\n- 300 vs 2,500+ is terrible initial odds\n- Enemy cavalry moving to envelope\n- Retreat under pressure is always dangerous\n- Hidden infantry must emerge and form up while enemy advancing\n- Timing coordination critical across multiple elements\n- Horses tire, men panic under pressure\n- Enemy might anticipate the trap\n- Gate bottleneck might slow enemy enough OR they might deploy faster than expected\n\nI should create outcomes ranging from disaster (cavalry routed, infantry doesn't emerge in time, light cavalry delayed) to excellent (perfect execution, enemy caught off-guard, flanking infantry emerges perfectly, light cavalry disrupts their deployment).\n\nCUSTOM D100 TABLE: OPENING PHASE EXECUTION\n\nFACTORS IN FAVOR (Pros):\n\nPlan thoroughly rehearsed and communicated\n\n700-yard retreat distance is manageable for cavalry\n\nHidden infantry has been disciplined in position for 7+ hours\n\nLight cavalry is ready and positioned for rapid response\n\nEnemy must deploy through gate bottleneck (takes time)\n\nTerrain and rally line chosen in advance\n\nClear command structure with experienced officers\n\nEnemy expects easy prey, not prepared defense\n\nFACTORS AGAINST (Cons):\n\n300 vs 2,500+ at initial contact - terrible odds\n\nEnemy cavalry already moving to envelope your position\n\nRetreat under pressure always chaotic and dangerous\n\nCoordination timing across multiple elements is complex\n\nHidden infantry must emerge and form defensive line while enemy advancing\n\nHorses tire, men can panic when pressure mounts\n\nAny hesitation or confusion could be fatal\n\nEnemy's forward elements are already committed and closing\n\n1-4: Catastrophic Failure\nMultiple critical breakdowns. Hidden infantry fails to emerge on time (confusion, fear, or poor timing). Light cavalry delayed reaching position. Your 300-man escort takes heavy casualties in retreat (80-120 killed/wounded) and barely reaches rally point in disorder. Enemy cavalry catches stragglers. Complete chaos, no defensive line formed. Must rely entirely on main force intervention to prevent rout.\n\n5-12: Severe Problems\nMajor execution failures. One flanking infantry group (500 men) emerges late or in wrong position. Light cavalry response sluggish (2-3 minute delay). Your escort suffers significant casualties in retreat (50-80 killed/wounded), some units break formation. Rally point reached but in disarray. Defensive line incomplete. Enemy pressing hard with advantage.\n\n13-24: Significant Issues\nNotable problems with timing. Hidden infantry emerges but formation is ragged, takes longer than planned to form line. Light cavalry arrives but deployment imperfect. Your escort takes moderate casualties (35-55 killed/wounded) during retreat, some disorder. Rally point reached but defensive position weak. Enemy maintains initiative.\n\n25-40: Mixed Execution\nPlan mostly works but with complications. Hidden infantry emerges on schedule but one group slower to form up. Light cavalry response adequate but not optimal. Your escort suffers casualties (20-40 killed/wounded) but maintains cohesion. Rally point reached, defensive line forms but gaps exist. Enemy presses advantage but doesn't break through.\n\n41-58: Adequate Execution\nPlan executes as designed with minor issues. Both flanking infantry groups emerge and form defensive line acceptably. Light cavalry responds within expected timeframe. Your escort takes modest casualties (15-30 killed/wounded) during fighting retreat. Rally point reached in good order. Defensive line solid. Enemy advance checked but not disrupted.\n\n59-74: Good Execution\nPlan works well. Hidden infantry emerges right on time, forms defensive line efficiently. Light cavalry charges in promptly, begins harassing enemy deployment. Your escort conducts professional fighting retreat with light casualties (10-20 killed/wounded). Rally point reached with formation intact. Strong defensive position established. Enemy momentum slowing.\n\n75-86: Excellent Execution\nNearly flawless coordination. Hidden infantry surprises enemy completely, emerges precisely and forms solid defensive line. Light cavalry hits enemy flanks at perfect moment, disrupting their advance. Your escort's retreat is textbook - minimal casualties (5-12 killed/wounded), perfect spacing. Rally point secure. Enemy caught off-balance by sudden appearance of prepared defenses.\n\n87-94: Outstanding Success\nPerfect tactical execution. Hidden infantry emergence stuns the enemy - they weren't expecting prepared forces. Flanking groups form impenetrable line. Light cavalry charge devastates enemy cavalry screen and disrupts infantry formation. Your escort takes minimal casualties (2-8 killed/wounded), retreats in perfect order like bait in a trap. Rally point is fortress. Enemy's sortie momentum completely broken.\n\n95-98: Masterful Trap Sprung\nThe counter-trap works spectacularly. Hidden infantry catches enemy completely by surprise - panic visible in Moorish ranks. Both groups form perfect defensive walls. Light cavalry charge shatters enemy cavalry screen entirely, causes confusion in infantry. Your escort virtually untouched (0-4 casualties), retreat looks choreographed. Enemy sortie stumbles into prepared killing ground with no idea it existed. Total tactical surprise achieved.\n\n99-100: Historic Perfection\nLegendary execution. Everything clicks perfectly - timing, positioning, coordination. Hidden infantry emergence causes visible terror in enemy ranks (\"Where did they come from?!\"). Formation instant and unbreakable. Light cavalry charge routes enemy cavalry screen and sends infantry reeling. Your 300 cavalry take virtually no casualties (0-2), retreat is a demonstration of discipline. Enemy sortie walks straight into perfect ambush, officers screaming contradictory orders. You've created the tactical situation of the century.\n\nPlease roll d100 for the opening phase execution.",

Enemy advance checked but not disrupted.\"\n\nSo I need to narrate:\n1. Juan putting on helmet when Sultan appears\n2. Juan riding back as gates open\n3. The 300-man escort conducting fighting retreat\n4. Hidden infantry emerging (both groups)\n5. Light cavalry responding\n6. Formation of defensive line at rally point\n7. Enemy sortie deploying and pursuing\n8. Overall outcome: plan works, but with minor issues and modest casualties\n\nThe tone should be: it works as planned, professional execution, but not perfect. Some problems, some casualties, but the fundamentals are solid. The enemy is checked but maintains pressure.\n\nI should NOT generate any dialogue or decisions for Juan. Just narrate what happens around him and the execution of the plan.\n\nThe Fighting Retreat\n\nThe moment the Sultan appears on the rampart, you lower your visor and slam your helmet into place. The world narrows to the vision slit. Your father's sword is already in your hand.\n\nThe gates boom open. The sortie force surges out.\n\n\"BACK!\" you shout. \"TO THE RALLY POINT!\"\n\nYour escort wheels as one, three hundred cavalry turning from the walls and spurring their horses into a canter. Not a rout—a controlled withdrawal. Captain Fernán and the Guardian Company form the rearguard, holding position a moment longer to cover the turn.\n\nBehind you, war drums thunder. The Moorish sortie pours through the gate—a river of steel and flesh. Infantry in the front, spears bristling. Cavalry wheeling wide on both flanks, beginning their envelopment.\n\nYour escort thunders across the open ground. Seven hundred yards to the rally point. The hoofbeats are deafening. You glance back—the enemy cavalry on their flanks is already moving faster, lighter horses gaining ground. They're trying to catch you before you reach your lines.\n\nCaptain Fernán's voice cuts through the din: \"REARGUARD—HOLD FORMATION!\"\n\nThe first enemy cavalry reaches your rear elements at about five hundred yards from the gate. Fifty Moorish horsemen, light cavalry with spears and curved swords, crash into the Guardian Company rearguard. The impact is visceral—steel on steel, horses screaming, men shouting.\n\nThree Guardian knights go down in the first exchange. Then two more. The rearguard holds just long enough, trading blows, then breaks away and spurs after the main body. Another man falls, a Moorish spear through his back.\n\nFour hundred yards from the gate. The rally point is close now—you can see the slight rise in terrain you'd selected. Your escort pounds toward it, formation beginning to loosen as faster horses pull ahead and tired ones fall behind.\n\nMore enemy cavalry hits your flanks. A knot of twenty Moroccan horsemen slams into the left side of your formation. Swords flash. Men grapple. A Calatrava knight is dragged from his saddle. Another takes a blade across his helm and reels but stays mounted.\n\nGarcía is suddenly beside you, his sword bloody. \"Keep riding, Your Majesty!\"\n\nThree hundred yards. Behind you, the main Moorish infantry is advancing at a run now, seeing your seemingly vulnerable retreat. Officers shout orders. The sortie force spreads wider, cavalry continuing to harass your flanks, infantry pressing forward in the center.\n\nTwo hundred yards from the gate. Six hundred yards from your army.\n\nAnd then—\n\nThe hidden infantry emerges.\n\nThe Trap Springs\n\nFrom the irrigation channel to your north, five hundred men rise from concealment. Not smoothly—there's a moment of confusion as the first soldiers clamber up the earthen bank, then more follow in a rush. Officers bark orders. Within twenty seconds, the mass of men is moving toward the rally point at a run.\n\nTo your south, the second group emerges from the olive grove and abandoned buildings. This group is faster—they were in better position. Five hundred infantry sprint toward the predetermined defensive line, shields ready, spears leveled.\n\nThe Moorish advance falters. You can hear the shouts of surprise even over the battle noise. Officers screaming at their men, trying to make sense of this sudden appearance of Castilian troops where none should be.\n\nBut the enemy is committed. The forward cavalry elements are already engaged with your escort. The infantry is too close to stop. The sortie force continues forward, but uncertainty has replaced confidence.\n\nYour escort reaches the rally point. Horses wheel, men dismount or reform in place. Captain Fernán is shouting orders, trying to organize three hundred cavalry who've just survived a running fight. Some of the men are wounded, bleeding but still functional. You count at least fifteen riderless horses. Maybe twenty.\n\nThe southern infantry group reaches the rally line first, forty seconds after emerging. They form up quickly—two ranks, spears forward, shields locked. A solid wall of five hundred men.\n\nThe northern group is slower. They're still forming when the first Moorish cavalry hits them. Fifty enemy horsemen crash into the incomplete formation. The Castilian line bends but doesn't break. Pikes come up. Horses scream and rear. Men grapple in a confused melee.\n\nBut they hold. Just barely.\n\nYour escort slots into the defensive line between the two infantry groups. Three hundred heavy cavalry, now dismounted or holding the center ground. It's not elegant, and there are gaps in the formation, but within ninety seconds of reaching the rally point, you have a defensive line. A thousand infantry. Three hundred cavalry. And you're on the slight elevation you'd chosen.\n\nLight Cavalry Response\n\nThe war horns sound from your main army.\n\nTwenty-five hundred light cavalry launches from your left flank. The thunder of hooves rolls across the plain like an earthquake. They come at full gallop, a wall of horsemen with lances leveled.\n\nThe Moorish cavalry screen—already engaged with your flanking infantry—doesn't see them coming until it's too late. The Castilian charge hits like a hammer. Moorish horsemen are scattered, ridden down, sent fleeing back toward their own lines. Within thirty seconds, the enemy cavalry threat on your flanks is eliminated.\n\nThe light cavalry doesn't stop. They wheel around your defensive position and begin harassing the advancing Moorish infantry, darting in to throw javelins and loose arrows, then retreating before the enemy can respond. Not a decisive blow, but enough to disrupt formations and slow the advance.\n\nThe response wasn't instant—maybe ninety seconds from the moment you reached the rally point. Adequate, but not perfect. If the Moorish cavalry had been more aggressive, or if your light cavalry had been thirty seconds slower, things might have gone badly.\n\nBut it worked.\n\nThe Situation\n\nYou stand at the rally point, your father's sword still in hand, surrounded by your household guard. Before you stretches your defensive line—ragged but solid. A thousand infantry, shields locked, spears forward. Your three hundred escort cavalry holding the center. Light cavalry swirling around the flanks, keeping the enemy honest.\n\nAnd advancing toward you, the Moorish sortie force.\n\nTwo thousand to twenty-five hundred troops. Infantry in the center, still organized despite the confusion of the trap being sprung. Cavalry reforming on the flanks after being scattered by your light horse. Officers visible, trying to restore order and coordinate the assault.\n\nThey're four hundred yards from your position. Still coming. Determined. The Sultan committed them, and backing down now would be as humiliating as defeat.\n\nBehind them, Granada's gates remain open. You can see more troops visible in the gateway—reserves, perhaps, or just observers. The walls are still crowded with defenders, watching.\n\nBehind you, your main army is already moving. Four thousand infantry advancing at the quick march. Fifteen hundred heavy cavalry under Don Fadrique forming up for the hammer blow. The trap is half-sprung.\n\nBut first, the sortie force has to hit your defensive line. And they're coming.\n\nCaptain Fernán appears at your side, breathing hard. His surcoat is torn and bloody. \"Fifteen dead, Your Majesty. Maybe twenty-five wounded. We held.\"\n\nGarcía is bleeding from a cut on his arm but ignoring it. Rodrigo's helm is dented but he's still standing. Your Guardian Company lost four men—the rearguard paid the price for the retreat.\n\nThe Moorish advance continues. Three hundred yards now. You can see individual faces. Hear the war cries. They know they've walked into a trap, but they're committed. The Sultan is watching from the walls.\n\nThis is the moment. They're going to hit your line within two minutes.\n\nWhat do you do?",

      "text": "But wait - I should probably narrate the immediate clash first, then determine if we need a roll for the overall battle outcome, or if we break it into phases.\n\nActually, looking at the plan from Chapter 18:\n- Phase 1: Approach (done)\n- Phase 2: Sortie and retreat (done - rolled 49)\n- Phase 3: Flanking infantry emerges (done as part of the 49 roll)\n- Phase 4: Light cavalry response (done)\n- Phase 5: Infantry reinforcement (happening now)\n- Phase 6: Heavy cavalry hammer (coming)\n\nSo I should narrate the main infantry clash and then the heavy cavalry assault. This probably needs another roll to see how the main battle goes - whether the sortie force is destroyed, defeated, or manages to escape relatively intact.\n\nBut the user just asked what he sees happening. He didn't declare an action requiring a roll. So I should narrate the unfolding battle based on the adequate execution we already rolled (49), showing the Moorish assault, the defensive stand, and the Castilian reinforcements arriving.\n\nHowever, this is a major combat with uncertain outcome. I should narrate up to the point where the outcome becomes uncertain, then create a table for how the overall battle concludes.\n\nLet me narrate the initial clash and the developing battle, then stop before the final outcome and create a table for that.\n\nThe Observer's View\n\nYou move back from the front line, thirty yards to a slight rise where you can see the battlefield spread before you. Captain Fernán and your household guard—García, Rodrigo, and a dozen Guardian knights—form a protective circle around you. From here, you have a clear view.\n\nThe Moorish sortie force advances in three main groups:\n\nCenter: Fifteen hundred infantry, mostly regular Granadan troops with Moroccan veterans mixed in. They advance in loose formation, shields up, spears forward. Officers on horseback behind the front ranks, shouting orders.\n\nLeft flank: Four hundred cavalry, light and medium horse, reforming after being scattered by your light cavalry. They're more cautious now, wary of another charge.\n\nRight flank: Three hundred cavalry, similar composition. Also reforming, but closer to their infantry.\n\nBehind them all, perhaps three hundred more troops are still deploying through the gate or holding position just outside the walls. Reserves or reinforcements.\n\nThe main Moorish infantry is two hundred yards from your defensive line now. They're not charging—advancing at a steady walk, maintaining formation. Professional. They know they've walked into a trap, but they're committed to making the best of it.\n\nYour defensive line waits. A thousand infantry in two ranks, shields locked, spears angled forward. Your three hundred dismounted cavalry in the center, heavier armor and longer swords. The line looks thin, but it's on good ground—the slight elevation gives a small advantage.\n\nBehind your defensive line, your main infantry is closing fast. Four thousand men advancing in disciplined blocks. Three minutes away. Maybe four.\n\nFarther back, Don Fadrique's heavy cavalry is forming up—fifteen hundred horsemen arranging themselves into a massive wedge formation. Five minutes away, maybe six. They need time to organize for the decisive charge.\n\nThe Clash\n\nOne hundred yards. The Moorish advance continues. Their war drums thunder. Men shout prayers and battle cries. \"ALLAH AKBAR! ALLAH AKBAR!\"\n\nFifty yards. Your light cavalry darts in from the flanks, loosing arrows and javelins, then wheeling away. Not enough to stop the advance, but enough to wound, to kill a few men, to fray nerves. Moorish soldiers raise shields against the missiles.\n\nTwenty yards.\n\nThe Moorish officers give the order: \"CHARGE!\"\n\nThe infantry breaks into a run, the last twenty yards covered in seconds. The impact when they hit your line is audible even from your position—a massive crash of wood on wood, steel on steel, men shouting and screaming.\n\nYour defensive line holds.\n\nThe front rank of your infantry locks shields and braces. Moorish spears thrust forward, seeking gaps. Castilian pikes jab back. Men in the second rank stab over the shoulders of the first. It's brutal, close-quarters work—there's no room for swordplay, just pushing and stabbing and trying not to die.\n\nYour three hundred cavalry in the center take the worst of it. They're more lightly armed for this kind of fighting than the infantry, but they're veterans. They hold. Captain Fernán is visible in the line, his sword rising and falling. Men press forward from behind, adding weight to the formation.\n\nThe northern section of your line—where the infantry was still forming when the Moorish cavalry hit them earlier—is under heavy pressure. The Moroccan veterans have concentrated there, sensing weakness. The line bends inward, men giving ground step by step. An officer goes down. The ranks waver.\n\nBut they don't break. Sergeants shout orders. Men in the rear push forward, adding bodies to the thin spots. Spears find targets. The line stabilizes, still bent but holding.\n\nThe southern section holds more easily. The troops there had more time to form up, and they're fresher. They're actually pushing forward slightly, driving the Moorish infantry back foot by foot.\n\nOn the flanks, the Moorish cavalry tries to envelope your position, but your light cavalry swarms them immediately. Every time enemy horsemen try to work around your line, Castilian cavalry hits them. It's not decisive fighting—just harassment and skirmishing—but it's enough. The Moorish flanks can't get around.\n\nTwo minutes into the melee. Your defensive line is still holding, but men are dying. You can see bodies falling, wounded crawling back from the fighting, gaps appearing in the ranks. The Moors are pressing hard, trying to break through before your reinforcements arrive.\n\nThree minutes. The pressure intensifies on your center. The Moorish infantry masses against your dismounted cavalry, sensing they're the weak point in the shield wall. Twenty men go down in quick succession. A gap opens.\n\nMoorish troops pour into the breach—thirty men, forty, trying to split your line in half.\n\nCaptain Fernán sees it instantly. He rallies the Guardian Company—maybe thirty knights still fighting—and they counterattack into the gap. Armored men swinging swords, pure violence at close quarters. Bodies fall on both sides. The gap is plugged, barely, but the fighting there is desperate.\n\nThe Reinforcement\n\nFour minutes into the battle, your main infantry arrives.\n\nFour thousand fresh troops in disciplined blocks hit the Moorish rear flanks. Not a charge—they're too organized for that—but a rapid advance that crashes into the enemy formation with overwhelming weight.\n\nThe effect is immediate. The Moorish infantry is suddenly fighting on three sides—your defensive line in front, Castilian blocks on both flanks. Formations begin to crumble. Officers shout contradictory orders. Men try to turn to face the new threats, but there's no room, no time.\n\nYour defensive line feels the pressure ease as the enemy formation compresses and loses cohesion. The bent northern section stabilizes. The southern section pushes forward more aggressively. Your center stops giving ground.\n\nThe Moorish officers can see what's happening. Some of them start shouting orders to withdraw—get back to the gates while there's still time. But the formation is too compressed, too engaged. Men can't disengage cleanly.\n\nOn the flanks, the Moorish cavalry realizes the infantry is collapsing and begins pulling back. Your light cavalry harries them, but doesn't pursue too aggressively—they're waiting to see if Don Fadrique needs them to screen his charge.\n\nFive minutes into the battle. The Moorish sortie force is in trouble. Not routed yet—they're still fighting hard, and the Moroccan veterans in particular are holding formation—but compressed, surrounded on three sides, losing cohesion.\n\nAnd then you hear it.\n\nThe Hammer Falls\n\nWar horns. Deep, resonant, from your rear.\n\nDon Fadrique's heavy cavalry.\n\nFifteen hundred armored horsemen in a massive wedge formation, arranged in three ranks. Lances leveled. The thunder of their hoofbeats shakes the ground. They come at full gallop across the plain, aimed directly at the compressed Moorish formation.\n\nThe enemy sees them coming. Officers scream warnings. Men try to form pike squares, to create anti-cavalry formations, but there's no time and no space. They're locked in combat with your infantry, can't maneuver, can't prepare.\n\nThe heavy cavalry hits like the wrath of God.\n\nThe impact point is the Moorish left flank—the side most exposed, where your main infantry has already disrupted their formation. Fifteen hundred armored horsemen crash into perhaps six hundred Moorish infantry trying desperately to form a defensive line.\n\nThe result is slaughter.\n\nLances punch through shields and bodies. Horses trample men underfoot. The entire Moorish left flank disintegrates in thirty seconds—men fleeing, dying, throwing down weapons and running for the gates.\n\nDon Fadrique's cavalry doesn't stop. They wheel through the enemy formation like a scythe through wheat, breaking apart what little cohesion remains. The wedge drives deep into the center of the Moorish force, splitting it in half.\n\nYour infantry presses forward from all sides now, sensing victory. The Moorish formation is fragmenting into isolated pockets—groups of ten or twenty men fighting back to back, surrounded, being cut down or surrendering.\n\nThe Moroccan veterans try to organize a fighting withdrawal. Perhaps three hundred of them form a loose square and begin fighting their way back toward the gates, step by bloody step. They're disciplined, these men—they've fought before, and they know how to retreat under pressure.\n\nBut most of the sortie force is simply trying to survive. Small groups run for the gates. Others throw down their weapons and surrender. Still others fight until they're killed.\n\nThe Pursuit\n\nSome of your troops pursue the fleeing Moors toward the gates. The range is closing—five hundred yards, four hundred, three hundred. Men are being cut down from behind.\n\nBut then—from the walls—a storm of missiles. Arrows, crossbow bolts, javelins rain down on the pursuing Castilians. The walls erupt with defensive fire, covering the retreat of the survivors.\n\nYour officers, seeing the danger, call off the pursuit. Horns sound the recall. Your troops pull back, out of range of the wall defenses, letting the survivors reach the safety of the gates.\n\nThe Moroccan fighting square reaches the gate intact—maybe two hundred fifty men, bloodied and exhausted but unbroken. They disappear through the gateway with discipline.\n\nOthers straggle in—individuals, small groups, running for their lives. Perhaps another three hundred make it back.\n\nThe gates begin to close, grinding shut with agonizing slowness. The last few survivors sprint through. One man doesn't make it—he's cut down ten yards from safety. Then the gates boom shut.\n\nThe Field\n\nThe battle is over. Twelve minutes from first contact to the gates closing.\n\nThe field before Granada is covered with bodies. Most wear Moorish colors. You can see Castilian dead too—your defensive line paid a price for holding that initial assault—but the disparity is staggering.\n\nWounded men cry out in both languages. Your troops move among them, finishing enemy wounded who resist, taking prisoners from those who surrender, and carrying your own wounded back to the camp.\n\nThe Master of Calatrava rides up to your position. His armor is splashed with blood—none of it his, apparently. He removes his helmet.\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" he says simply. \"It's done.\"\n\nFrom the walls of Granada, thousands of faces watch in silence. The Sultan's green standard still flies, but you don't see the Sultan himself anymore. He's withdrawn from sight.\n\nThis is the immediate aftermath. The battle clearly went well for Castile, but we need to determine the specifics of losses on both sides and exactly how badly the sortie force was damaged.\n\nWe need a roll to determine the battle's overall outcome—specifically casualties and the tactical/strategic result.\n\nShall I create a d100 table for the battle outcome?",

      "text": "Now Juan is positioning himself with his mounted guard as a reserve behind the lines while the battle develops.\n\nI need to create a realistic table that covers:\n- How effective the defensive line holds\n- How well the phased reinforcements work\n- Casualty ratios on both sides\n- Whether Moorish force is destroyed, defeated, or escapes\n- Tactical and strategic outcomes\n\nFactors favoring Castile:\n- Numerical superiority once reinforcements arrive (1,000 + 300 + 2,500 light cav + 4,000 infantry + 1,500 heavy cav = 9,300 vs 2,500-3,000)\n- Phased commitment strategy\n- Surprise from hidden infantry\n- Better positioning (rally point on elevation)\n- Enemy deployed through bottleneck\n- Momentum and morale from Alcalá victory\n- Enemy doesn't realize full scale of trap until committed\n\nFactors favoring Granada:\n- Initial numerical advantage at contact point\n- Fighting quality of Moroccan veterans\n- Desperation/motivation\n- Walls provide cover for retreat\n- Some Castilian troops tired from fighting retreat\n \nI'll focus on the tactical vulnerabilities created by the imperfect defensive positioning. The northern section shows notable coordination challenges, with uneven infantry placement leaving potential exploitation points for the Moorish forces. These gaps could allow enemy troops to probe and potentially create localized breakthroughs if not quickly addressed by reserve units like Juan's mounted guards.\n\nCUSTOM D100 TABLE: BATTLE OUTCOME - THE SORTIE ENGAGEMENT\n\nFACTORS IN FAVOR (Pros):\n\nMassive numerical superiority once all forces committed (9,000+ vs 2,500-3,000)\n\nPhased reinforcement strategy with fresh troops\n\nEnemy deployed through bottleneck, can't use numbers efficiently\n\nSurprise element from hidden infantry already achieved\n\nDefensive position on favorable ground\n\nHeavy cavalry hammer blow available\n\nHigh morale from Alcalá victory\n\nEnemy doesn't realize scale of trap until too late\n\nProfessional commanders executing coordinated plan\n\nFACTORS AGAINST (Cons):\n\nInitial defensive line has gaps from \"adequate\" execution\n\nSome troops tired from fighting retreat\n\nNorthern section of line weakened from early cavalry contact\n\nMoroccan veterans are elite troops who fight well\n\nEnemy desperate and highly motivated\n\nWall defenses can cover Moorish retreat\n\nCoordination of multiple elements still has timing risks\n\nYour 300-man escort took casualties, may be less effective\n\nClose-quarters melee always unpredictable\n\n1-3: Disaster - Defensive Line Breaks\nYour defensive line collapses under initial assault. Northern section breaks completely, southern section fragments. Moorish troops pour through gaps. Your 300-man reserve must commit immediately to prevent rout. Heavy casualties (400-600 killed, 300+ wounded). Enemy suffers moderate losses (600-900) but achieves tactical success. Must withdraw in disorder. Strategic humiliation.\n\n4-8: Severe Setback - Line Nearly Breaks\nDefensive line holds barely, but multiple breaches occur. Desperate fighting. Your reserve must commit to plug gaps. Main infantry arrives but battle is chaotic melee. Heavy cavalry charge less effective due to confused battlefield. Heavy Castilian casualties (300-450 killed, 250-400 wounded). Moorish losses moderate (700-1,100). Most enemy force escapes intact. Tactical draw, strategic disappointment.\n\n9-16: Costly Victory - Line Holds at Great Price\nDefensive line holds but takes severe punishment. Bloody attritional fighting before reinforcements arrive. Your escort heavily engaged. Main infantry's arrival turns tide but slowly. Castilian casualties heavy (220-350 killed, 200-350 wounded). Moorish losses significant (1,100-1,500 killed/wounded). 1,000-1,400 enemy troops escape. Tactical victory but expensive.\n\n17-28: Hard-Fought Success\nDefensive line holds under pressure. Northern section nearly breaks but stabilizes. Main infantry arrival provides needed relief. Heavy cavalry charge effective but not devastating. Significant Castilian casualties (160-250 killed, 180-300 wounded). Moorish losses substantial (1,400-1,800 killed/wounded/captured). 700-1,100 escape to city. Solid tactical victory, clear success.\n\n29-45: Clear Victory - Plan Works\nDefensive line holds well despite pressure. Reinforcements arrive with good timing. Heavy cavalry charge breaks enemy formation. Moderate Castilian casualties (120-200 killed, 150-250 wounded). Heavy Moorish losses (1,600-2,100 killed/wounded/captured). 400-900 escape. Strong tactical victory. Enemy sortie capability damaged.\n\n46-62: Strong Victory - Execution Solid\nDefensive line holds comfortably. Phased reinforcements execute well. Heavy cavalry charge devastating. Castilian casualties moderate (90-160 killed, 120-200 wounded). Very heavy Moorish losses (1,800-2,400 killed/wounded/captured). 250-700 escape, mostly Moroccan veterans. Convincing tactical victory. Enemy sortie force shattered.\n\n63-76: Decisive Victory - Trap Springs Well\nDefensive line dominates. Enemy realizes trap too late to adapt. Reinforcements arrive at perfect moments. Heavy cavalry charge crushes enemy formation. Light Castilian casualties (60-120 killed, 90-160 wounded). Devastating Moorish losses (2,000-2,600 killed/wounded/captured). 150-500 escape. Decisive tactical victory. Enemy combat capability severely damaged.\n\n77-87: Crushing Victory - Near Perfect Execution\nDefensive line overwhelms initial assault. Enemy formation fragments quickly. Phased reinforcements create multiple killing zones. Heavy cavalry charge routes surviving enemy. Minimal Castilian casualties (40-90 killed, 60-130 wounded). Catastrophic Moorish losses (2,200-2,800 killed/wounded/captured). 100-300 escape. Crushing tactical victory. Enemy field force effectively destroyed.\n\n88-95: Overwhelming Victory - Masterful Battle\nDefensive line demolishes enemy assault. Trap execution nearly flawless. Enemy caught in perfect killing ground. Heavy cavalry charge annihilates surviving formations. Very light Castilian casualties (25-60 killed, 40-90 wounded). Massive Moorish losses (2,400-3,000 killed/wounded/captured). 50-150 escape, mostly by surrendering to reach city. Overwhelming victory. Enemy military prestige shattered.\n\n96-99: Historic Triumph - Complete Destruction\nPerfect execution. Defensive line becomes killing ground. Enemy formation disintegrates. Heavy cavalry charge achieves total rout. Minimal Castilian casualties (15-40 killed, 25-60 wounded). Total Moorish catastrophe (2,600-3,200 killed/wounded/captured). 20-100 straggle back. Historic tactical masterpiece. Enemy field capability eliminated. Sultan's position in city may be threatened.\n\n100: Legendary Victory - The Sultan Falls\nEverything goes perfectly. Enemy walks into perfect trap. Total annihilation. Castilian casualties trivial (10-25 killed, 15-40 wounded). Moorish force destroyed (2,800-3,500 killed/wounded/captured). Sultan or key commanders killed/captured in the chaos. Legendary victory that will be studied for centuries. Campaign potentially shortened dramatically. Granada may offer surrender.\n\nPlease roll d100 for the battle outcome.",

I should describe specific moments that show why this was a decisive victory - enemy formation breaking, panic spreading, the trap becoming obvious too late.\n\nI should include:\n1. The initial clash at the defensive line going well\n2. The Moorish force realizing too late they're in a trap\n3. The main infantry arriving at the right moment\n4. The heavy cavalry charge being devastating\n5. The rout and pursuit\n6. Specific casualty details within the range\n7. Who escaped (mostly elite Moroccan troops showing discipline)\n8. The aftermath on the field\n\nI should NOT generate any dialogue or actions for Juan - just describe what he sees happening, and then stop when he needs to make a decision.\n\nThe Battle Unfolds\n\nFrom your position thirty yards behind the line, you watch the Moorish sortie force advance. Two thousand five hundred troops in three groups—center infantry mass, cavalry on both flanks. They advance steadily, professionally. War drums thunder. Officers shout orders.\n\nOne hundred yards from your defensive line.\n\nFifty yards.\n\nThe charge comes—the last twenty yards covered at a run. The impact is tremendous—a massive crash as two thousand Moorish troops hit your thousand-man defensive line. Steel on steel. Wood on wood. Men screaming battle cries and death cries.\n\nYour line holds.\n\nNot just holds—dominates.\n\nThe southern section, which had time to form properly, becomes a killing ground. The Castilian infantry locks shields and sets spears at perfect angle. The Moorish troops crash into a wall of steel. Men die in the first three seconds—dozens of them, impaled on pikes or crushed against shields. The Moorish front rank staggers, recoils, pushes forward again. More die.\n\nThe center holds firm. Your three hundred dismounted cavalry, veterans all, fight with grim efficiency. They give ground measured in inches, not feet. Captain Fernán is visible in the midst of it, his sword rising and falling with methodical precision. Men fall around him—Moors, mostly.\n\nEven the northern section—the one that had trouble forming—holds better than expected. Yes, the Moroccan veterans push them back, bend the line inward. But it doesn't break. The sergeants keep their men together. The second rank pushes forward. Spears find targets. The line bends but holds.\n\nTwo minutes into the engagement, you can see the realization spreading through the Moorish ranks. This isn't a vulnerable escort caught out of position. This is a prepared defensive position. Officers are shouting, trying to adapt, but they're committed now—locked in close combat, formations compressed, no room to maneuver.\n\nThen they see the infantry.\n\nThe Reinforcements\n\nFour thousand Castilian infantry advancing from your rear. Not at a charge, but at quick march—disciplined blocks of men in formation, approaching like an avalanche in slow motion.\n\nYou watch the Moorish officers realize what's happening. Some of them start shouting—trying to reorganize, to form defensive positions facing the new threat. But their troops are locked in combat with your defensive line. They can't disengage. They can't turn. They can only watch as four thousand fresh soldiers close in on their flanks.\n\nThe main infantry hits three and a half minutes into the battle.\n\nThe effect is immediate and devastating. The Moorish formation, already fully committed against your defensive line, is suddenly crushed between two forces. Your defensive line in front, fresh infantry blocks on both flanks. Nowhere to go. Nowhere to maneuver.\n\nThe southern Moorish flank collapses within thirty seconds. Five hundred Moorish troops caught between your defensive line pushing forward and a block of Castilian infantry smashing into their exposed flank. Men go down in waves. Some try to surrender. Others try to fight their way out. Most just die.\n\nThe northern flank holds longer—the Moroccan veterans there are elite troops, they've fought in worse situations. They form a hasty defensive square, spears outward, trying to create space. But they're outnumbered three to one, fighting on two sides, and more Castilians keep arriving.\n\nThe center Moorish formation begins to fragment. Officers lose control. Units break into smaller groups, isolated pockets of men fighting back to back, surrounded. The cohesive battle line becomes a confused melee of a dozen separate small fights.\n\nYour defensive line senses victory. They push forward aggressively now, driving the enemy back step by step. Men who were defending desperately two minutes ago are now attacking, pressing advantage.\n\nFive minutes into the battle. The Moorish sortie force is compressed into an area perhaps two hundred yards across, surrounded on three sides, formations shattered. Still fighting—particularly the Moroccan veterans—but clearly losing.\n\nThen the horns sound.\n\nThe Hammer\n\nDon Fadrique's fifteen hundred heavy cavalry appears from your rear. They've formed a massive wedge—three ranks deep, lances leveled, the finest armored horsemen in Castile. The thunder of their approach makes the ground shake.\n\nThe Moorish troops see them coming. You can see the terror spreading through their ranks even from here. Men try to form pike squares—the only defense against cavalry—but there's no time, no space, no cohesion left in their formations.\n\nThe heavy cavalry strikes the Moorish left flank.\n\nThe impact is total. Lances punch through shields, through bodies, through everything. Horses trample men underfoot. Armored knights swing swords and maces with devastating force. The entire left side of the Moorish formation—already weakened, already compressed—simply disintegrates.\n\nDon Fadrique doesn't stop. The wedge drives through the Moorish formation like a blade through cloth, splitting it in half. The rear rank of cavalry wheels left, the front rank wheels right, and suddenly the Moorish force isn't just surrounded—it's carved into fragments, each piece isolated and being destroyed piecemeal.\n\nThe Moroccan veterans try to organize a fighting withdrawal. Three hundred of them form a loose square and begin fighting their way back toward the gates, step by bloody step. They're disciplined, these men. They hold formation. They protect each other. They kill anyone who gets too close. Slowly, leaving a trail of bodies—Castilian and Moorish both—they move toward the city walls.\n\nBut the rest of the sortie force breaks.\n\nNot all at once. Not a single moment of collapse. But unit by unit, group by group, men throw down their weapons and surrender or try to run for the gates. Your cavalry rides them down. Your infantry surrounds clusters of resistance and forces surrender.\n\nSome groups fight to the end—twenty men here, thirty there, surrounded by hundreds of Castilians, refusing to yield. They die hard.\n\nSeven minutes into the battle, it's effectively over. The Moorish sortie force is destroyed as a fighting formation. What remains is just the killing and the surrender.\n\nThe Pursuit\n\nPerhaps six hundred Moors are still on their feet and trying to reach the gates. The Moroccan square—now down to maybe two hundred fifty men—is halfway there, fighting every step. Other groups sprint for safety, individuals and small clusters running for their lives.\n\nYour troops pursue. Cavalry rides down the fleeing. Infantry jogs after them, cutting down stragglers. The range to the walls closes—four hundred yards, three hundred, two hundred.\n\nThen the walls erupt.\n\nThousands of arrows, crossbow bolts, and javelins rain down from Granada's defenses. The storm of missiles is immense—covering the retreat of the survivors, making the ground before the gates a killing zone for your troops.\n\nYour officers see it immediately. Horns sound the recall. \"PULL BACK! PULL BACK!\" The pursuit stops. Your men withdraw out of range, letting the survivors reach safety.\n\nThe Moroccan square reaches the gate intact—perhaps two hundred twenty men left, bloodied and exhausted but still in formation, still disciplined. They disappear through the gateway with the bearing of professionals who've done this before.\n\nOther survivors straggle in. Small groups, individuals, men throwing away weapons and armor to run faster. Perhaps another two hundred fifty make it to the gates—some wounded, all terrified.\n\nThe gates grind shut. The last few men sprint through. One doesn't make it—cut down by pursuing cavalry fifteen yards from safety, his body left in the dust.\n\nThe gates boom closed with finality.\n\nThe Field\n\nSilence falls. Not complete—wounded men groan and cry out, horses scream, officers shout orders. But the battle noise is gone. The war drums are silent. The clash of steel has ended.\n\nThe field before Granada is covered with dead and dying. Most wear Moorish colors—green and white surcoats, distinctive Moroccan armor, the lighter gear of Granadan regulars. But Castilian dead lie among them too, particularly in the area where your defensive line made its stand.\n\nYour troops move across the battlefield. Finishing enemy wounded who resist. Taking prisoners from those who surrender. Carrying your own wounded back to the camp. Stripping the dead of weapons and armor. The grim work that follows every battle.\n\nBodies lie in clusters where formations made their final stands. A group of thirty Moroccan veterans, surrounded by perhaps fifty dead Castilians, fought to the death together. A pocket of Granadan infantry, trapped by cavalry, died back to back. Your defensive line's position is marked by a wall of Moorish dead—men who impaled themselves on pikes in the initial assault.\n\nThe Master of Calatrava rides up to your position. His white surcoat is splashed red. His sword is notched and bloody. He removes his helmet and wipes sweat from his face.\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" he says simply. \"A complete victory.\"\n\nDon Fadrique arrives moments later, his heavy cavalry reforming behind him. His horse is breathing hard, flanks heaving. He's bleeding from a cut above his eye—minor, but his face is a mask of blood.\n\n\"The sortie force is destroyed,\" he reports. \"We estimate four hundred to five hundred made it back to the city. The rest...\" He gestures at the field.\n\nCaptain Fernán approaches, limping slightly. His armor is dented and scored, his surcoat shredded. But he's grinning fiercely. \"Your escort held, Your Majesty. We held them.\"\n\nFrom the walls of Granada, thousands of faces watch in silence. No jeering. No arrows. Just silence. The Sultan's green standard still flies, but you haven't seen the Sultan himself since the gates opened. He's withdrawn from sight.\n\nCasualties\n\nOver the next hour, your officers compile reports. The numbers come in pieces—unit by unit, company by company.\n\nCastilian Losses:\n\nKilled: 87 men\n23 from your 300-man escort (died in the fighting retreat and defensive line)\n\n31 from the defensive line infantry (northern section took worst casualties)\n\n19 from the main infantry (flanking attacks)\n\n14 from Don Fadrique's cavalry (trampled wounded, caught by pike squares)\n\nWounded: 143 men (most will recover, though some will lose limbs or be unfit for further service)\n\nTotal: 230 casualties from 10,000 engaged\n\nMoorish Losses (estimated from battlefield count and prisoner interrogation):\n\nKilled: Approximately 1,450-1,550 (bodies being counted)\n\nWounded and captured: 520-580 prisoners (many wounded, being treated in your camp)\n\nEscaped to city: 400-500 survivors\n\nTotal sortie force: ~2,500 deployed\n\nCasualty rate: 78-82%\n\nThe sortie force is effectively destroyed. Of the twenty-five hundred men the Sultan committed, perhaps four hundred fifty made it back combat-capable. The rest are dead or in your hands.\n\nThe Immediate Aftermath\n\nIt's mid-morning now. The sun climbs higher. The battlefield is being cleared. Your wounded are being treated. Prisoners are being organized—disarmed, gathered in groups under guard, given water.\n\nGranada's walls remain silent. The gates are closed. No further sorties. No negotiation attempts. Just silence and thousands of faces watching.\n\nYour army has deployed around the field—cavalry screening the flanks, infantry holding position, ready for any response. But no response comes.\n\nBehind you, officers are organizing the captured weapons and armor—a fortune in military equipment. Five hundred twenty to five hundred eighty prisoners will need to be guarded and fed. The wounded—yours and theirs—need care.\n\nThe Master of Calatrava stands beside you, surveying the field. \"The Sultan gambled everything on that sortie,\" he says quietly. \"And lost. His field force is gone. He has perhaps three thousand men left in the city—garrison troops, militia, whatever survived this. He cannot face us in open battle again.\"\n\nDon Fadrique nods agreement. \"We control the field. We've demonstrated total military superiority. The question is—what do we do now?\"\n\nFrom the walls, Granada watches. Waiting to see what the victorious Christian army will do next.\n\nWhat are your orders?",

      "text": "Juan has just won a decisive victory and now orders the systematic destruction of the Vega - Granada's agricultural heartland. This is consistent with his original plan: demand surrender, and when refused, devastate the countryside.\n\nThis is a significant moment. I need to:\n1. Show his commanders' reactions to this order\n2. Describe the systematic destruction\n3. Show the impact on Granada (watching from walls)\n4. Handle the prisoners - what happens to them?\n5. Show the scale of economic devastation\n6. Track time and logistics\n7. Eventually show Granada's response\n\nThis is dark but historically authentic - medieval warfare included economic devastation as a standard tactic. The Vega is Granada's breadbasket, so destroying it is strategically sound even if brutal.\n\nI should NOT:\n- Moralize about Juan's decision\n- Have commanders object on moral grounds (they wouldn't in 1430)\n- Soften the impact\n- Generate dialogue for Juan\n\nI should describe what happens based on his order, show reactions, and then stop when he needs to make another decision.\n\nThe Order\n\nYour words hang in the air. The Master of Calatrava and Don Fadrique exchange a glance, then both nod.\n\n\"It will be done, Your Majesty,\" the Master says simply.\n\nDon Fadrique turns to a messenger. \"Summon the company commanders. Immediately.\"\n\nWithin ten minutes, twenty officers have gathered around you—cavalry commanders, infantry captains, the heads of the Military Orders contingents. They stand in a rough circle, bloodstained and weary from the battle, waiting for orders.\n\nYou repeat the command. Clear. Unambiguous.\n\nThere's no objection. No hesitation. These are men who understand medieval warfare. The Sultan refused your demand. He attacked during what should have been a parley. He lost. Now comes the price.\n\nThe Master of Calatrava begins issuing tactical orders:\n\n\"The army divides into mobile columns. Each column takes a sector of the Vega. Burn the crops—wheat, barley, everything in the fields. Destroy the mills—watermills, windmills, every one. Wreck the irrigation systems—break the channels, fill them with rubble, make them unusable. Torch any supply depots, granaries, storage facilities outside the city walls. Leave nothing.\"\n\nDon Fadrique adds: \"Cavalry screens each column. Light horse scouts ahead, heavy cavalry ready to respond if Granada sends out defenders. Infantry does the burning. Systematic, thorough, professional.\"\n\nAn officer asks: \"The villages, my lord?\"\n\nThe Master looks at you.\n\nThe villages scattered across the Vega are mostly abandoned—civilians fled when your army approached. But some may have people still present. The question is whether you want the buildings burned as well, or just the crops and economic infrastructure.\n\nWhat are your orders regarding the villages and any civilians encountered?",

      "text": "The Clarification\n\n\"Leave the villages standing,\" you say firmly. \"And the villagers. We're not here to burn peasants out of their homes. We're here to destroy Granada's ability to wage war. Crops, mills, irrigation—the things that feed armies. Anyone who opposes us dies. Anyone who stays in their home and does not resist is left alone.\"\n\nThe Master of Calatrava nods approvingly. \"A measured hand, Your Majesty. It preserves the moral authority of the crusade while achieving the strategic objective.\"\n\nDon Fadrique agrees. \"And it means refugees won't flood into Granada, straining their supplies. The peasants will stay in their villages with nothing to harvest. They become Granada's problem, not corpses on our conscience.\"\n\nThe orders are refined and dispatched. Within the hour, your army begins to move.\n\nThe Devastation Begins\n\nYour ten thousand troops divide into twelve mobile columns, each assigned a sector of the Vega de Granada. The fertile plain stretches for miles around the city—some of the richest agricultural land in Iberia. Wheat fields golden in the spring sun. Barley ready for harvest in a few weeks. Vegetable gardens. Orchards of figs, olives, and pomegranates. The intricate network of irrigation channels that makes all of it possible.\n\nBy noon, the Vega is burning.\n\nFirst Column - Northeast Sector\n\nEight hundred men under a Calatrava commander sweep through the fields northeast of the city. Torches are distributed. Men wade into the wheat fields and set them ablaze. The grain is dry enough to burn readily—within minutes, flames race across the fields, consuming months of growth in seconds.\n\nThe smoke rises in great black columns, visible for miles.\n\nA watermill sits beside an irrigation channel. The soldiers smash the wheel with axes, break the grinding stones, set fire to the wooden structure. The building collapses in flames. The miller and his family watch from their cottage a hundred yards away—terrified but unharmed. The soldiers don't approach the cottage.\n\nA village of perhaps thirty houses sits on a small rise. Most are empty—the inhabitants fled days ago. But three families remained, too old or too stubborn to leave. Castilian soldiers march through, checking for weapons or hidden fighters. They find none. An old woman curses them from her doorway. The soldiers ignore her and move on. The houses are left standing.\n\nBut the village's fields are torched. The communal granary—full of last year's harvest—is emptied, the grain scattered and burned. The irrigation channel that waters their plots is filled with rubble and debris.\n\nSecond Column - Western Sector\n\nA thousand men sweep the Vega west of Granada, closest to the city walls. This is the most dangerous sector—well within view of the defenses, potential target for another sortie.\n\nBut no sortie comes. The gates remain closed. From the walls, thousands of Granadans watch the destruction in silence.\n\nThe fields here are the most productive—decades of careful cultivation and irrigation. The soldiers are thorough. Wheat fields burn. Vegetable gardens are trampled. Fruit trees are hacked down or set ablaze. A large windmill—a beautiful structure with four great sails—is systematically destroyed. The machinery is smashed, the sails cut down, the building set afire.\n\nAn irrigation channel that's been maintained for two hundred years is wrecked in an afternoon. Men with picks and shovels break the carefully constructed stone channels. Others fill sections with earth and rocks. Water that once flowed to hundreds of acres of fields now drains uselessly into depressions or spreads into swamps.\n\nA peasant tries to stop them—an old man who spent his life maintaining that channel. He runs at the soldiers with a shepherd's staff, screaming curses. A sergeant cuts him down with a single stroke. The body is left where it falls. The work continues.\n\nThird Column - Southern Sector\n\nNine hundred infantry and three hundred cavalry work through the southern Vega. This sector has several large estates—properties of wealthy Granadan merchants or minor nobility. The manor houses are empty, their owners fled to the city.\n\nThe soldiers ignore the houses but destroy everything else. Granaries full of stored grain are emptied and burned. Stables are emptied of horses (taken as prizes) and then torched. Workshops are wrecked—a blacksmith's forge, a carpenter's shop, a pottery kiln all smashed and burned.\n\nThe fields stretching around each estate burn for hours. Olive groves that took thirty years to mature are cut down. Fig orchards are destroyed. Vineyards are torn up, vines thrown into piles and burned.\n\nA large mill complex—with three separate wheels powered by a diverted stream—is methodically demolished. The wheels are broken, the stones cracked with sledgehammers, the buildings burned. The stream is dammed and diverted, flooding the old mill site.\n\nA village elder approaches the column commander under a white flag. He offers a bribe—twenty gold dinars—to spare his village's mill. The commander refuses. The mill is destroyed. But the village houses are untouched, and the elder is allowed to return unharmed with his gold.\n\nThe Scope\n\nThe devastation continues all afternoon. Column after column works through assigned sectors. The pattern repeats across the entire Vega:\n\nDestroyed:\n\nFields of wheat and barley (hundreds of acres)\n\nVegetable gardens and orchards\n\nMills (water and wind) - every one found\n\nGranaries and storage facilities\n\nIrrigation channels and systems\n\nAgricultural workshops and equipment\n\nBridges over irrigation channels\n\nWells (filled with rubble or poisoned with dead animals)\n\nSpared:\n\nVillage houses and peasant cottages\n\nCivilians who do not resist\n\nReligious buildings (several small mosques left standing)\n\nLivestock (taken as spoils, not slaughtered)\n\nBy late afternoon, the Vega de Granada looks like a vision of hell. Smoke rises from a dozen major fires, merging into a dark cloud that hangs over the valley. The golden fields are black stubble. The green gardens are trampled mud. The intricate network of irrigation—built over centuries—is a mass of broken stone and diverted water.\n\nGranada's Response\n\nFrom the walls, the city watches. You can see the crowds—thousands of people lining the ramparts, staring at the destruction of their agricultural heartland. The economic foundation of the kingdom going up in smoke.\n\nBut no response comes. No sortie. No sally. No attack.\n\nThe Sultan has no forces left to send. His sortie force is destroyed. His garrison is minimal. All he can do is watch.\n\nLate afternoon, a single arrow arcs out from the walls. It falls short of the nearest Castilian column by two hundred yards—a gesture of impotent rage, nothing more.\n\nBy evening, the work is largely complete. Your columns begin withdrawing back toward the main camp, their missions accomplished. The cavalry screens pull back last, ensuring no pursuit.\n\nEvening Camp\n\nYour army reassembles a mile from the city. Officers report to the command tent throughout the evening:\n\nResults:\n\nApproximately 600-800 acres of grain fields destroyed (representing several months of food supply)\n\n27 watermills and 8 windmills destroyed or damaged beyond immediate use\n\nIrrigation network severely damaged across 40-50% of the Vega\n\nDozens of granaries and storage facilities emptied and burned\n\nMajor disruption to agricultural infrastructure\n\nCasualties:\n\n3 killed (including the old man who attacked soldiers)\n\n7 wounded (minor skirmishes, accidents)\n\nNo organized resistance encountered\n\nCivilian Impact:\n\nZero villages burned\n\nApproximately 15-20 civilians killed (those who fought or attacked)\n\nHundreds of peasants witnessed destruction but left unharmed\n\nMany will face starvation in coming months without the harvest\n\nMilitary Impact:\n\nGranada's food supply for the coming year severely compromised\n\nCity will have to import grain at great expense or face shortages\n\nIrrigation repairs will take months or years\n\nEconomic foundation of the kingdom damaged\n\nThe Master of Calatrava presents the summary. \"Granada can still feed itself from stores and imports, Your Majesty. But they cannot feed an army in the field. They cannot sustain a long campaign. We've crippled their ability to wage offensive war.\"\n\nDon Fadrique adds: \"And we've demonstrated that we can reach their heartland at will. The Sultan gambled and lost, and this is the price.\"\n\nFrom your camp, you can see Granada in the distance. The city is lit by torches and fires—normal evening lights. But the surrounding Vega is darkness punctuated by the glow of still-burning fields.\n\nSmoke still rises, visible against the stars.\n\nIt's evening, May 10, 1431. Your army is encamped a mile from Granada. The sortie force is destroyed. The Vega is devastated. You have 520-580 prisoners. Granada's gates remain closed.\n\nWhat are your orders for tomorrow?",

Juan's internal reflection (if appropriate, though I should be careful not to narrate his thoughts too much)\n2. The modified orders being issued\n3. The retreat to Alcalá\n4. Any events during the retreat\n5. Status update upon return\n\nI need to be careful to:\n- Not generate Juan's dialogue or detailed thoughts\n- Narrate the world's response to his orders\n- Describe what happens during the retreat\n- Provide appropriate status summary at the end\n\nLet me proceed with the narrative.\n\nThe Modified Orders\n\nThe Master of Calatrava listens to your orders and nods thoughtfully. \"A wise revision, Your Majesty. The irrigation can be repaired when Granada is Christian. Better to preserve what can be preserved.\"\n\nHe turns to the assembled officers. \"New directive: no more destruction of mills or irrigation infrastructure. Focus on existing food stores—granaries, supply depots, anything that feeds Granada's garrison or army. Take what we can carry, burn what we cannot. Then we march for Alcalá.\"\n\nDon Fadrique adds practical details: \"We'll need wagons for the grain. And the prisoners—five hundred eighty captives to move. We'll need additional guards and a slow march.\"\n\nCaptain Fernán raises a concern: \"The return march puts us on the road for two days. Granada knows our route. If they have any forces hidden in the fortresses between here and Alcalá, they could harass us.\"\n\nThe Master considers. \"Unlikely. Their field forces are destroyed. The fortress garrisons won't risk a sortie against ten thousand troops. But we'll march in defensive formation regardless. Cavalry screens, infantry in the center, prisoners in the middle of the column.\"\n\nOrders are dispatched. The army will spend one more day in the Vega—focusing on granaries and supply depots—then begin the march home.\n\nThe Second Day - May 11, 1431\n\nDawn breaks over a changed landscape. The smoke has cleared somewhat, but the Vega is visibly scarred—black fields, broken irrigation channels, the burnt husks of mills. Your army rouses early and moves out in organized columns.\n\nToday's work is more methodical. Less dramatic than yesterday's fires, but strategically valuable.\n\nA large granary complex two miles west of Granada—likely a military supply depot—is discovered by a cavalry patrol. It contains an enormous quantity of stored grain: wheat, barley, dried beans, salted meat. Enough to feed several thousand men for months.\n\nYour troops spend three hours emptying it. What can be loaded onto requisitioned wagons is taken—perhaps a third of the total. The rest is scattered on the ground and burned. The building itself is left standing, empty.\n\nThree smaller granaries in villages across the Vega receive the same treatment. The grain is either taken or destroyed. The buildings are spared. In one village, an old woman spits at the soldiers as they work. No one strikes her. The work continues.\n\nA supply depot near an abandoned estate yields military stores: barrels of salted fish, dried fruit, oil, wine. All of it is loaded onto wagons or distributed to your troops. The depot building is torched after being emptied—it's clearly military infrastructure, not a civilian structure.\n\nSeveral smaller caches are found hidden in cellars and storage pits. Nobles and wealthy merchants hid food supplies when your army approached. The soldiers find them methodically—they've done this before, know where to look. Everything useful is confiscated.\n\nBy afternoon, your wagons are loaded with food—enough to feed your army for two weeks, or to supplement the supplies at Alcalá for longer. The strategic depots that could have fed Granada's garrison through a siege are empty or destroyed.\n\nThe irrigation systems are left alone, as ordered. The mills still standing are spared. You can see relief in some of the officers' faces—destroying infrastructure felt wasteful. This feels more like warfare, less like vandalism.\n\nGranada watches from the walls. Silent. Impotent.\n\nThe Withdrawal - May 11, Afternoon\n\nBy mid-afternoon, your army begins the march back to Alcalá la Real. The column forms up with practiced efficiency:\n\nFormation:\n\nVanguard: 500 light cavalry, scouting ahead\n\nMain body: 6,000 infantry in defensive formation\n\nCenter: 580 prisoners under heavy guard, plus supply wagons\n\nFlanks: 1,500 heavy cavalry, split between both sides\n\nRear guard: 2,000 infantry plus 1,000 light cavalry\n\nThe wounded from yesterday's battle are transported in wagons or on horseback—those who can't walk. Eighty-seven bodies are also being carried back for proper burial. The Moorish dead were left on the field, as is customary.\n\nThe march begins. Ten thousand men, six hundred prisoners, dozens of wagons. The column stretches for over a mile.\n\nYou ride near the front with your household guard, the Master of Calatrava, and Don Fadrique. Behind you, the crusade banner streams in the afternoon breeze. Your white armor, cleaned this morning, gleams in the sunlight.\n\nAs the army moves east, you look back once. Granada sits in the distance, red walls and white towers against the mountains. The Alhambra complex sprawls across its hill, magnificent even from miles away. The Vega around it is scarred and blackened.\n\nThe city that has defied Castile for centuries. Still unconquered. But damaged. Humbled. Watching an enemy army march away unopposed after destroying its economic foundation.\n\nThe Master of Calatrava follows your gaze. \"We'll be back,\" he says quietly. \"With artillery. With a proper siege train. And next time, those gates will open from the inside.\"\n\nThe March - May 11-12\n\nThe march back to Alcalá takes two full days. The route passes through territory you secured on the way southwest—the lands around Alcalá la Real that are now under Castilian control.\n\nEvening, May 11:\n\nThe column camps for the night in open country, about halfway to Alcalá. Defensive perimeter established, cavalry patrols sent out, prisoners secured under guard. No incidents. The surrounding countryside is quiet—any Moorish forces that might have harassed you are gone, fled, or hiding.\n\nThe troops are in good spirits despite the march. You won a decisive victory. Destroyed an enemy army. Devastated Granada's heartland. Took prisoners and spoils. And now you're marching home with minimal casualties. This is what success looks like.\n\nAround the campfires, men tell stories of the battle. The moment the gates opened. The fighting retreat. The hidden infantry emerging. The heavy cavalry charge. Already the battle is becoming legend—embellished, dramatic, heroic.\n\nYour name is in every story. The king in white armor, challenging the Sultan at his own gates. Standing before three thousand Moors with just three hundred men. Leading the trap that destroyed them.\n\nMorning, May 12:\n\nThe march resumes at dawn. The column makes good time—the road is decent, the weather clear, morale high. By afternoon, Alcalá la Real is visible in the distance.\n\nInfante Enrique rode out to meet you with a cavalry escort. He's grinning as he approaches. \"Your Majesty! We saw the smoke from here. The whole Vega burning. And the word has spread—the sortie destroyed, Granada humiliated. A magnificent victory!\"\n\nHe falls in beside you as the column continues. \"The men at Alcalá have been desperate for news. When they see this—the army intact, prisoners in chains, victory complete—morale will soar.\"\n\nIndeed, as your column approaches Alcalá, you can see the garrison troops lining the walls, cheering. The crusade banner is raised above the fortress. Horns sound in welcome.\n\nReturn to Alcalá la Real - May 12, Late Afternoon\n\nYour army enters the fortress and the surrounding encampment to a hero's welcome. The garrison troops—nine thousand men who held the position while you marched on Granada—erupt in celebration.\n\nFray Hernando is waiting at the fortress entrance. He clasps your arm warmly. \"God's blessing upon you, Your Majesty. I heard the reports—the Sultan's sortie destroyed, the Vega laid waste. The crusade advances on every front.\"\n\nAhmad al-Zarqali is present as well, observing with his characteristic thoughtful expression. He bows respectfully. \"A decisive demonstration, Your Majesty. Granada will not forget this.\"\n\nThe prisoners are herded into a secure compound—an open area surrounded by stone walls, heavily guarded. They'll need to be housed, fed, and eventually processed. Five hundred eighty men—most wounded, all exhausted and demoralized.\n\nThe captured supplies are unloaded and added to your depots. The wounded are taken to the infirmary. The dead are prepared for burial—a mass grave outside the fortress for the common soldiers, individual graves for knights and officers.\n\nOfficers begin filing reports. Scribes record the battle details for the official histories. Messengers are prepared to carry news across Castile and to Rome.\n\nCouncil Meeting - Evening, May 12\n\nThat evening, you gather with your senior commanders in the main hall of Alcalá's fortress. The Master of Calatrava, Don Fadrique, Infante Enrique, the senior Military Orders commanders, Fray Hernando, Ahmad al-Zarqali.\n\nThe Master of Calatrava presents the strategic assessment:\n\nImmediate Results:\n\nGranada's sortie capability destroyed (2,000+ casualties inflicted)\n\nCity's field army effectively eliminated\n\nVega's agricultural production crippled for this year\n\nMajor economic blow to Granada's war-making capacity\n\nPsychological impact immense—Sultan humiliated at his own gates\n\nCurrent Situation:\n\nYour forces at Alcalá: ~19,000 troops (10,000 returned, 9,000 garrison)\n\nCasualties: Light—87 killed, 143 wounded (already being treated)\n\nPrisoners: 580 (burden on supplies but potential for ransom or exchange)\n\nMorale: Sky-high across entire army\n\nSupply situation: Excellent, augmented by captured stores\n\nGranada's Situation (estimated):\n\nField forces: Effectively destroyed\n\nGarrison: 2,500-3,500 troops remaining (mostly militia, garrison troops)\n\nMoroccan reinforcements: Still en route (won't arrive for weeks)\n\nMercenaries: Being recruited but won't assemble until June/July\n\nFood supplies: Damaged by Vega devastation\n\nMorale: Likely catastrophic after sortie disaster\n\nWestern Army Status:\nLast report (May 8) indicated they were advancing on Málaga. No word since then—communications take time. Results of their campaign unknown.\n\nStrategic Options:\n\nOption 1: Press the Attack\n\nMarch on another fortress (Loja, Moclín, or smaller targets)\n\nWithout artillery, means mining, starvation siege, or assault\n\nRisk: Artillery still being repaired, major siege difficult\n\nOpportunity: Enemy demoralized, momentum is with us\n\nOption 2: Consolidate and Wait\n\nHold position at Alcalá\n\nWait for artillery repairs (2-3 weeks)\n\nLet Western Army complete operations\n\nAllow troops to rest and wounded to recover\n\nGather intelligence on Granada's response\n\nRisk: Giving enemy time to recover and reinforce\n\nOption 3: Raiding Campaign\n\nMultiple mobile columns strike across frontier\n\nHit smaller targets, supply lines, isolated positions\n\nKeep pressure on Granada without committing to major siege\n\nMaintain initiative while conserving forces\n\nOption 4: Return to Granada\n\nAnother demonstration at their gates\n\nFurther devastation of remaining Vega infrastructure\n\nPsychological pressure for surrender\n\nRisk: Diminishing returns, no new military gains\n\nThe council looks to you for guidance.\n\nSTATUS SUMMARY - MAY 12, 1431\n\nDate: May 12, 1431 (Evening)\nLocation: Alcalá la Real\n\nForces at Alcalá:\n\nTotal: ~19,000 troops (10,000 mobile, 9,000 garrison/reserve)\n\nCasualties: 87 killed, 143 wounded (from Granada operation)\n\nMorale: Excellent\n\nSupplies: Ample (augmented by captured Granadan stores)\n\nPrisoners: 580 Moorish soldiers (mostly wounded)\n\nRecent Victory:\n\nGranada sortie force destroyed (2,000+ enemy casualties)\n\nVega de Granada heavily damaged (economic blow)\n\nSultan humiliated, Granada demoralized\n\nArtillery Status: Being repaired, 2-3 weeks until operational\n\nWestern Army: Status unknown (last report: advancing on Málaga, May 8)\n\nTreasury: ~390,000 florins available in Castile (campaign budget separate)\n\nKey Relationships:\n\nMaster of Calatrava: Full confidence restored\n\nInfante Enrique: Eager for action, grateful for trust\n\nCommanders: Unanimous confidence in your leadership\n\nTroops: Morale at campaign high\n\nGranada Situation:\n\nField forces destroyed\n\n~3,000 garrison troops remaining\n\nFood supplies damaged\n\nReinforcements not arriving until June/July\n\nPolitical situation unknown (Sultan's position uncertain)\n\nWhat are your orders? Which strategic option do you choose, or do you have another plan?",

But I need to be more precise. The Master mentioned in Chapter 18 that it would take time for repairs. Let me check if there's more specific information about how long bombard repairs would take.\n\nThe user is specifically asking whether the artillery is ready NOW (May 12), not projecting into the future. I should not assume - I should either:\n1. Tell them the status based on the timeline (it's been about 3 weeks, so likely close to ready or ready soon)\n2. Or have them roll to determine the actual repair progress\n\nI think the most honest answer is that it's been about 3 weeks since they were sent for repairs, so they should be very close to operational or just becoming operational now. But let me provide the specific timeline and let the player know the status.\n\nArtillery Status Check\n\nThe Master of Calatrava considers your question. \"The bombards were sent to Jaén on April 20th, Your Majesty. Today is May 12th—that's three weeks and one day.\"\n\nHe pauses, calculating. \"Pietro estimated two to three weeks for repairs—replacing the cracked barrel, rebuilding the demolished carriage, restoring the powder reserves. We're at the edge of that timeline now.\"\n\nDon Fadrique adds: \"We haven't received word from Jaén yet about the repairs being complete. But if Pietro kept to his schedule, the bombards should be operational now or within the next few days.\"\n\nThe Master nods. \"We could send a fast messenger to Jaén—get confirmation of their status and order them to march here if they're ready. Or we could wait for Pietro's report, which should arrive any day if the work is complete.\"\n\nThe artillery has been in repair for just over 3 weeks. Pietro estimated 2-3 weeks for repairs.\n\nOptions:\n\nSend a messenger to Jaén to check status and order the artillery to march to Alcalá if ready (messenger returns in 2-3 days with report)\n\nWait for Pietro's report (should arrive within a few days if repairs are complete)\n\nAssume they're ready and plan your next operation accordingly\n\nMake other strategic decisions that don't depend on the artillery\n\nWhat do you want to do?",

      "text": "This is sensible - he's waiting for intelligence before making his next move. I should narrate:\n- The sending of the messengers\n- The army resting and recovering\n- The passage of a few days\n- The return of the messengers with reports\n\nI need to check the project knowledge for what the western army has been doing. From what I saw earlier, they took Vélez-Málaga in early April. It's now mid-May, so they've had over a month since then. I should create a realistic report of what they've accomplished.\n\nLet me search for more details about the western army's last known status.\n\nIt's now May 12th, so over a month has passed since then. I need to determine what they've been doing. Since Juan didn't give them specific orders at that time (the chapter moved on to other topics), they likely either consolidated or made their own tactical decisions.\n\nGiven it's been over a month, I should create a realistic report of their progress. They have 12,000 troops, naval support, and face limited opposition. A reasonable outcome would be:\n- They consolidated Vélez-Málaga\n- Possibly took one or two smaller targets\n- OR they attempted Málaga and either succeeded or are besieging it\n\nI'll need to create a realistic update for what's happened over the past 5+ weeks with the western army.\n\nOrders Dispatched - May 12, Evening\n\nYou give the orders to the Master of Calatrava, who immediately summons messengers.\n\n\"Two fast riders to Jaén,\" he directs. \"Find Master Gunner Pietro Calabrese. Inquire about the status of the artillery repairs—are the bombards operational? When can they march? Request immediate report.\"\n\n\"And four riders west,\" Don Fadrique adds. \"Two to Seville to reach the command center there, two to attempt to find the western army directly—last known at Vélez-Málaga. Request full report on operations, current position, casualties, and strategic situation.\"\n\nThe messengers are equipped with fresh horses, supplies for a week, and sealed letters bearing your seal. They depart within the hour—Jaén is two days' ride east, Seville is a week west, and Vélez-Málaga perhaps ten days if the roads are safe.\n\n\"We should have word from Jaén within four to five days,\" the Master calculates. \"The western reports will take two weeks minimum, possibly three depending on where the army actually is.\"\n\nYou nod. \"Then we rest here and wait for intelligence. The men have earned it.\"\n\nRest and Recovery - May 13-16, 1431\n\nThe army settles into Alcalá la Real for four days of genuine rest. After the intensity of the Granada operation—the march, the battle, the devastation, the return—your troops need time to recover.\n\nActivities During Rest:\n\nMedical Care:\nThe wounded from the Granada battle receive proper attention. Surgeons work in the fortress infirmary—setting broken bones, stitching wounds, treating infections. Of the one hundred forty-three wounded, most are recovering well. Perhaps ten will lose limbs. Another fifteen are severely wounded and may not survive. The rest will return to duty within days or weeks.\n\nEquipment Maintenance:\nArmor is cleaned and repaired. Weapons are sharpened. Horses are rested, reshod, and fed properly. Wagons are mended. The organized chaos of an army maintaining itself fills the fortress and surrounding camps.\n\nReligious Observances:\nFray Hernando—returned from his embassy preparations—conducts a memorial service for the eighty-seven men killed at Granada. They're buried with honor in the fortress cemetery, individual graves for knights, a mass grave for common soldiers. The chaplains lead prayers. The troops attend in full armor, a show of respect.\n\nAnother service gives thanks for the victory. Fray Hernando speaks of divine favor, of God's judgment against those who rejected His mercy, of the crusade's righteousness. The troops listen with the attentiveness of men who survived battle and know they'll face more.\n\nPrisoner Management:\nThe five hundred eighty Moorish prisoners are housed in a secure compound. They're fed—basic rations but adequate—and their wounded are treated by the same surgeons caring for Castilian troops. Fray Hernando visits them daily, offering instruction in the faith but not forcing it. A few express interest in conversion. Most remain silent and defeated.\n\nAhmad al-Zarqali spends time among them, speaking in Arabic, answering questions about his own conversion, explaining Christian teachings. His presence is complicated—some prisoners see him as traitor, others as honest man making honest choice. His calm reasonableness is more effective than any forced sermon.\n\nTraining and Drills:\nLight drills only—enough to keep units cohesive, not enough to exhaust men who need rest. Companies practice formations. Cavalry runs simple maneuvers. The crusaders conduct weapons practice. Nothing strenuous. Just maintaining readiness.\n\nMorale:\nExcellent. The victory at Granada is the talk of every campfire. Stories spread and grow—the king in white armor challenging the Sultan, the trap perfectly sprung, the enemy destroyed. Songs are being written. The troops believe they're part of something historic.\n\nYou're visible throughout the camp—walking among the troops, visiting the wounded, observing drills, attending services. Not managing every detail, but present. Available. The commander who fights beside his men, not above them.\n\nSupply Status:\nAdequate. The captured Granadan stores supplement your existing supplies. Food is plentiful. The surrounding villages—now under Castilian control—provide fresh provisions. Water is abundant. The army is well-fed and comfortable.\n\nInfante Enrique's reserve force has secured the area thoroughly. Fourteen villages and three minor fortresses within ten miles are under Castilian authority. Patrols sweep the countryside daily. Guerrilla activity in the immediate area has ceased—the raiders have pulled back toward Granada proper.\n\nReport from Jaén - May 16, Late Afternoon\n\nFour days after the messengers departed, riders return from Jaén. They gallop through Alcalá's gates and head directly to the fortress. You're meeting with the Master of Calatrava and Don Fadrique when they arrive, dusty and tired.\n\nThe lead messenger bows. \"Your Majesty, report from Master Gunner Pietro Calabrese.\"\n\nHe hands you a sealed letter. You break the seal and read:\n\nFrom Master Gunner Pietro Calabrese\nTo His Majesty King Juan II\nDate: May 14, 1431\n\nYour Majesty,\n\nThe bombards are ready.\n\nRepairs completed May 11th. The cracked barrel has been replaced with a new casting commissioned from a foundry in Seville—excellent work, tested thoroughly. The demolished carriage has been rebuilt, reinforced at stress points. All five bombards are now fully operational.\n\nGunpowder reserves restored. We have sufficient powder for fifteen days of sustained bombardment, plus reserve stocks being produced in Jaén's workshops. Stone shot has been cut and stockpiled—four hundred rounds prepared, more being produced daily.\n\nCrews are rested and ready. Ox teams are healthy and trained. We can march on your order.\n\nTime to Alcalá from Jaén: Five days with current road conditions, possibly six if weather turns poor. We will maintain standard artillery march pace—careful, methodical, protecting the equipment.\n\nAwaiting your command.\n\nPietro Calabrese\nMaster Gunner, Royal Artillery\n\nYou look up at the Master of Calatrava. \"They're ready. We can have artillery here within a week.\"\n\nDon Fadrique grins. \"Then we can choose our next target. Íllora? Moclín? Or something else entirely?\"\n\nThe Master nods thoughtfully. \"With artillery, we can take any fortress we choose. The question is which one advances our strategy most effectively.\"\n\nMay 17-20: Waiting for Western Reports\n\nThe artillery is ready, but you're still waiting for word from the western army. Days pass. The army continues its rest—though now with a sense of anticipation rather than pure recovery. Training intensifies slightly. Commanders begin discussing potential targets.\n\nÍllora remains the obvious choice—damaged from the earlier siege, known garrison strength, strategically valuable. But Moclín is another option, or even a push toward Loja despite its stronger defenses.\n\nThe Master of Calatrava presents updated intelligence on nearby fortresses, refined from the earlier scout reports:\n\nÍllora:\n\nGarrison: 650-700 troops\n\nDefenses: Partially repaired from April bombardment but still weakened\n\nCommander: Muhammad al-Rashid (competent)\n\nStrategic value: Controls road junction, important supply route\n\nSiege estimate: 2-3 weeks with artillery\n\nMoclín:\n\nGarrison: 400 troops\n\nDefenses: Strong, natural position on steep hill\n\nStrategic value: Overlooks approaches to Granada\n\nSiege estimate: 3-4 weeks with artillery (difficult approach for guns)\n\nMontefrio:\n\nGarrison: 200-250 troops\n\nDefenses: Modest fortress, weaker than others\n\nStrategic value: Limited, but easy target\n\nSiege estimate: 1-2 weeks with artillery\n\nWestern Army Report - May 20, Morning\n\nTwo and a half weeks after your messengers departed, riders finally return from the west. Not your original messengers—these are different men, wearing the colors of Admiral Enríquez's household troops.\n\nThey're brought to you immediately. The senior rider, a grizzled sergeant, bows deeply.\n\n\"Your Majesty, I bring dispatches from Admiral Don Fadrique Enríquez de Mendoza and from Don Álvaro de Estúñiga, commanding the western army.\"\n\nHe hands you two sealed letters and a rolled map. You open the first letter—from the Admiral, written in Seville:\n\nFrom Admiral Don Fadrique Enríquez de Mendoza\nSeville Command Center\nDate: May 12, 1431\n\nYour Majesty,\n\nI write with reports from the western campaign. Don Álvaro de Estúñiga and Don Rodrigo Manrique have prosecuted operations along the coast with considerable success.\n\nSummary of operations since April:\n\nVélez-Málaga (April 2-6): Secured as previously reported. Citadel taken, garrison expelled, port fortified. Currently held by 2,500-troop garrison. Functioning as supply base for further operations.\n\nNerja (April 15-18): Small coastal fortress, 8 miles east of Vélez-Málaga. 150-man garrison. Besieged April 15th, surrendered April 18th after brief bombardment by ship-mounted artillery. Minimal casualties (12 dead, 18 wounded). Garrison allowed to depart. Fortress held by 400-troop garrison.\n\nAlmuñécar (April 28 - May 3): Coastal town with fortified citadel, 15 miles east of Nerja. 300-man garrison. Siege began April 28th. Town taken quickly, citadel resisted. Bombardment opened breaches. Citadel stormed May 3rd. Moderate casualties (67 dead, 103 wounded). 180 prisoners taken. Fortress held by 600-troop garrison.\n\nCurrent situation (as of May 10th):\n\nThe western army (9,500 combat-effective troops after garrison detachments) has consolidated at Almuñécar and is prepared for further operations. Three coastal fortresses now secured, providing a continuous chain of supply bases along 35 miles of coastline.\n\nStrategic assessment:\n\nThe coastal campaign has succeeded in establishing a secure foothold with minimal casualties (total: 137 dead, 215 wounded across all three operations). Granada has not contested our naval supremacy—no war galleys encountered, no significant relief forces sent.\n\nHowever, the next logical target—Málaga—presents a significantly greater challenge. See Don Álvaro's attached report for details.\n\nDon Fadrique Enríquez de Mendoza\nAdmiral of Castile\n\nYou open the second letter—from Álvaro de Estúñiga himself, written from the field:\n\nFrom Don Álvaro de Estúñiga\nWestern Army, Almuñécar\nDate: May 10, 1431\n\nYour Majesty,\n\nThree fortresses taken, three victories won. The coastal campaign advances as planned. Morale is excellent. The fleet performs magnificently—Genoese galleys and Portuguese ships working in perfect coordination. Supply lines are secure.\n\nBut we have reached a decision point.\n\nThe Málaga Question:\n\nMálaga is the great prize of the western coast—a major city with extensive fortifications, a large harbor, significant population, and symbolic importance second only to Granada itself.\n\nIntelligence gathered indicates:\n\nGarrison: 1,200-1,500 troops (mix of regulars, militia, armed citizens)\n\nFortifications: Extensive—multiple walls, fortified alcazaba (citadel), gibralfaro fortress on high ground, protected harbor\n\nPopulation: 8,000-10,000 civilians\n\nStrategic value: Immense—controls western coastal approaches, major port, economic center\n\nOur assessment:\n\nWith our current forces (9,500 troops), we can besiege Málaga. We have naval supremacy, can blockade the harbor, can establish siege lines. Traditional siege equipment is adequate for bombardment—no wall-breaking artillery needed initially.\n\nHowever, this will be a major operation:\n\nDuration: 6-10 weeks minimum, possibly longer if garrison fights hard\n\nCasualties: Estimated 300-600 dead, 400-800 wounded\n\nRisk: Granada might finally contest this—it's important enough to defend\n\nCommitment: Would lock western army in place for remainder of campaign season\n\nAlternative strategy:\n\nContinue sweeping smaller coastal targets eastward (Salobreña, Motril, perhaps toward Almería). This maintains momentum, secures more ports, extends our supply chain farther, and continues bleeding Granada's coastal defenses.\n\nAdvantages:\n\nLower casualties\n\nMaintains flexibility\n\nSecures more territory\n\nLess risky\n\nDisadvantages:\n\nMálaga remains in enemy hands\n\nSmaller strategic impact\n\nCould be seen as avoiding the hard fight\n\nMy recommendation:\n\nBesiege Málaga. It's the objective that matters. Taking it would be a crushing blow to Granada—economic, strategic, and psychological. It's worth the cost and the risk.\n\nBut I await Your Majesty's orders. This decision is too significant for a field commander to make alone.\n\nDon Álvaro de Estúñiga\nCommander, Western Army\n\nYou set down the letters and examine the map. It shows the western coastline with the three captured fortresses marked—Vélez-Málaga, Nerja, and Almuñécar. Málaga is clearly marked twenty miles west of Vélez-Málaga, a substantial city icon drawn on the coast.\n\nThe Master of Calatrava reads over your shoulder. \"Three fortresses in six weeks. Excellent progress. Light casualties. The western front is succeeding.\"\n\nDon Fadrique (the one beside you, not the Admiral) nods. \"And now they're asking whether to strike the real target or continue with easier victories.\"\n\nYou have decisions to make:\n\nArtillery orders: Send the bombards from Jaén to Alcalá for an eastern operation? Or send them west to support the siege of Málaga?\n\nWestern army orders: Besiege Málaga, or continue with smaller coastal targets?\n\nEastern operations: If the artillery comes here, which fortress do you target?\n\nThe campaign is at a strategic crossroads.\n\nSTATUS SUMMARY - MAY 20, 1431\n\nDate: May 20, 1431\nLocation: Alcalá la Real\n\nEastern Forces (Your Command):\n\nAt Alcalá: ~19,000 troops (rested, recovered, excellent morale)\n\nCasualties from Granada: 87 killed, 143 wounded (most recovering)\n\nPrisoners: 580 Moors\n\nSupplies: Excellent\n\nArtillery Status:\n\n5 bombards operational in Jaén\n\nReady to march on your order\n\n5 days to reach Alcalá, or can be redirected elsewhere\n\nWestern Army:\n\nCombat effective: 9,500 troops (after garrisons)\n\nGarrisons: 3,500 troops holding three fortresses\n\nTotal: 13,000 troops\n\nCasualties (cumulative): 137 killed, 215 wounded\n\nPosition: Almuñécar, prepared for further operations\n\nFortresses secured: Vélez-Málaga, Nerja, Almuñécar\n\nStrategic Situation:\n\nEastern front: Dominant position, enemy demoralized, fortresses vulnerable\n\nWestern front: Excellent progress, now facing major decision on Málaga\n\nGranada: Field forces destroyed, assembling reinforcements (won't arrive until June/July)\n\nMomentum: Strongly in Castile's favor\n\nKey Decisions Required:\n\nArtillery deployment (east or west?)\n\nWestern army orders (Málaga or smaller targets?)\n\nEastern target selection (if artillery comes east)\n\nWhat are your orders?",

Granada sent significant forces west and defeated the invasion. Army retreating or barely holding beachhead. Strategic disaster.\n\n5-10: Severe Setback\nLanding succeeded but operations failed. Besieged one fortress, couldn't take it without artillery. Heavy casualties (300-500 killed/wounded) for no gains. Currently consolidating at beachhead with no territorial conquests. Granada contesting the invasion. Morale damaged.\n\n11-18: Minimal Progress\nSecured beachhead and took ONE weak coastal fortress (small garrison, poor defenses). Moderate casualties (200-350 killed/wounded). Currently holding that single position. Progress stalled—next targets prove too strong without artillery. Army intact but frustrated.\n\n19-28: Limited Success\nTook ONE significant coastal fortress (Vélez-Málaga or similar). Required 3-4 weeks of siege. Moderate to heavy casualties (250-400 killed/wounded). Good position established but no further progress. Army needs rest and resupply before continuing. Solid but limited achievement.\n\n29-42: Modest Success\nSecured TWO coastal positions (one significant, one minor). Combined casualties moderate (200-350 killed/wounded). Established supply chain along coast. Currently preparing for next operation. Decent progress but slower than hoped. Army intact and functional.\n\n43-58: Adequate Success\nTook TWO to THREE coastal fortresses of varying importance. One significant (Vélez-Málaga class), others smaller. Casualties acceptable (150-280 killed/wounded). Secure supply bases established. Army ready for continued operations. Solid progress matching reasonable expectations.\n\n59-72: Good Success\nSecured THREE coastal fortresses including at least one major position. Light to moderate casualties (120-220 killed/wounded). Strong coastal foothold established over 25-30 miles of coastline. Supply chain secure. Army in good condition, high morale, ready for major operation. Better than expected progress.\n\n73-84: Strong Success\nTook FOUR coastal positions including one or two significant fortresses. Light casualties considering objectives (100-180 killed/wounded). Extensive coastal territory secured (35-40 miles). Excellent supply situation. Army experienced and confident, positioned for push toward Málaga or other major target. Very successful campaign.\n\n85-92: Excellent Success\nSecured FOUR to FIVE coastal fortresses including multiple significant positions. Minimal casualties for gains achieved (80-150 killed/wounded). Dominant coastal presence established over 40-50 miles. Granada unable to contest effectively. Army in excellent condition, potentially already besieging or taking major target like Málaga. Outstanding campaign execution.\n\n93-97: Overwhelming Success\nTook FIVE to SIX positions including major fortresses. Very light casualties (60-120 killed/wounded). Granada's entire western coast effectively controlled. May have already taken Málaga or be on verge of doing so. Complete naval and territorial dominance. Exceptional campaign—everything went right.\n\n98-100: Miraculous Campaign\nSecured SIX+ fortresses including Málaga itself or other major cities. Minimal casualties (40-100 killed/wounded). Granada's western coastal defenses collapsed. Potentially threatening Granada from the west. Historic campaign success that exceeded all projections. Perfect execution combined with Granada's complete inability to respond.\n\nPlease roll d100 for the western army's campaign results (April - mid-May 1431).",

      "text": "The roll is 39, which falls in the \"Modest Success\" category:\n- Secured TWO coastal positions (one significant, one minor)\n- Combined casualties moderate (200-350 killed/wounded)\n- Established supply chain along coast\n- Currently preparing for next operation\n- Decent progress but slower than hoped\n- Army intact and functional\n\nSo the western army has taken two coastal fortresses - one significant (likely Vélez-Málaga as the first major target) and one smaller one. Casualties are moderate but not catastrophic. Progress has been slower than hoped, probably due to lack of artillery making sieges more difficult and time-consuming.\n\nI need to write dispatches that reflect this outcome realistically. The tone should be: \"We've made progress, we have two positions, but it's been harder than expected without artillery, and we're at a decision point about what to do next.\"\n\nLet me create realistic reports from the Admiral in Seville and from Álvaro de Estúñiga in the field.\n\nWestern Army Report - May 20, Morning\n\nTwo and a half weeks after your messengers departed, riders finally return from the west. Not your original messengers—these are different men, wearing the colors of Admiral Enríquez's household troops.\n\nThey're brought to you immediately. The senior rider, a grizzled sergeant, bows deeply.\n\n\"Your Majesty, I bring dispatches from Admiral Don Fadrique Enríquez de Mendoza and from Don Álvaro de Estúñiga, commanding the western army.\"\n\nHe hands you two sealed letters. You open the first—from the Admiral, written in Seville:\n\nFrom Admiral Don Fadrique Enríquez de Mendoza\nSeville Command Center\nDate: May 12, 1431\n\nYour Majesty,\n\nI write with reports from the western campaign. The operations have achieved success, though progress has proven slower and more costly than initial projections suggested.\n\nSummary of operations since April:\n\nVélez-Málaga (April 2-22):\n\nFleet landed April 2nd, three miles east of the town\n\nBeachhead established with moderate resistance (31 dead, 56 wounded)\n\nTown assault began April 4th, fell April 6th with light resistance\n\nCitadel siege commenced immediately—garrison of 420 troops withdrew to fortified position\n\nWithout artillery, siege required traditional methods: mining, siege towers, trebuchet bombardment\n\nBreaches achieved April 18th after two weeks of intensive siege work\n\nFinal assault April 20th—bloody fighting (89 dead, 127 wounded)\n\nCitadel taken April 22nd, garrison surrendered\n\nTotal casualties: 120 dead, 183 wounded\n\nCurrently held by 2,800-troop garrison plus naval support\n\nNerja (May 5-10):\n\nSmall coastal fortress, 8 miles east of Vélez-Málaga\n\nGarrison of 120 troops\n\nBesieged May 5th with 2,500 troops\n\nTrebuchet bombardment and mining operations\n\nGarrison attempted sortie May 8th—repulsed with casualties\n\nSurrendered May 10th when walls were breached\n\nCasualties: 43 dead, 71 wounded\n\nCurrently held by 500-troop garrison\n\nCurrent situation (as of May 10th):\n\nWestern army holds two coastal fortresses. After garrison detachments, 8,700 combat-effective troops remain for offensive operations. Fleet is intact and performing well—no naval opposition encountered.\n\nTotal campaign casualties to date: 163 dead, 254 wounded\n\nAssessment:\n\nThe lack of wall-breaking artillery has made operations significantly more difficult and time-consuming than anticipated. Vélez-Málaga required three weeks to reduce—with bombards, it likely would have fallen in one week. Casualties are higher than hoped due to the necessity of assault operations rather than bombardment-forced surrenders.\n\nNevertheless, we have secured two positions and established a functioning supply base. The army is intact, experienced, and capable of continuing operations.\n\nDon Fadrique Enríquez de Mendoza\nAdmiral of Castile\n\nYou open the second letter—from Álvaro de Estúñiga, written from the field:\n\nFrom Don Álvaro de Estúñiga\nWestern Army, Nerja\nDate: May 10, 1431\n\nYour Majesty,\n\nTwo fortresses taken. The coastal campaign advances, though not at the pace we initially projected.\n\nThe Reality of Siege Warfare Without Artillery:\n\nI must report frankly: operations without bombards are far more difficult than anticipated. Vélez-Málaga cost us three weeks and over two hundred casualties. Traditional siege methods—mining, siege towers, trebuchets—work, but they are slow, dangerous, and costly in lives.\n\nEvery siege means:\n\nBuilding siege equipment on site (1-2 weeks)\n\nDigging approaches under fire (constant casualties)\n\nMining operations (risky, slow)\n\nFinal assaults against prepared defenses (bloody)\n\nThe men fight bravely and the sieges succeed, but we pay in blood and time for each fortress.\n\nStrategic Situation:\n\nWe currently hold:\n\nVélez-Málaga: Major port, secure supply base, 2,800-troop garrison\n\nNerja: Minor fortress, 500-troop garrison\n\nActive force: 8,700 troops ready for operations\n\nTotal secured coastline: ~20 miles\n\nThe Málaga Question:\n\nMálaga lies 20 miles west of Vélez-Málaga. Intelligence indicates:\n\nGarrison: 1,400-1,600 troops (regulars, militia, armed citizens)\n\nFortifications: Extensive—alcazaba citadel, gibralfaro fortress, multiple wall circuits\n\nPopulation: 8,000-10,000 civilians\n\nStrategic importance: Immense\n\nWith our current forces and methods, besieging Málaga would require:\n\nDuration: 8-12 weeks minimum, possibly longer\n\nCasualties: Estimated 400-700 dead, 500-900 wounded\n\nRisk: Granada might finally commit forces to break the siege\n\nCommitment: Would consume remainder of campaign season\n\nWithout artillery, this becomes an extremely costly and uncertain operation.\n\nAlternative Options:\n\nOption 1: Continue taking smaller coastal targets (Salobreña, Almuñécar to the east). Less costly, maintains momentum, but avoids the decisive objective.\n\nOption 2: Consolidate current positions. Fortify what we hold, establish permanent coastal presence, wait for reinforcement or artillery before attempting Málaga.\n\nOption 3: Attempt Málaga anyway. Accept the casualties and duration as necessary costs for the strategic prize.\n\nOption 4: Request artillery from Your Majesty's forces. With bombards, we could take Málaga in 3-4 weeks with acceptable casualties.\n\nMy frank assessment:\n\nThe western campaign has succeeded in establishing a coastal foothold, but we have reached the limit of what can be achieved without wall-breaking artillery. Traditional siege methods work against small fortresses like Nerja, but against a major city like Málaga, they become prohibitively expensive.\n\nIf Your Majesty can spare the bombards, we can take Málaga and potentially the entire western coast by autumn. Without them, we can only nibble at smaller targets or accept catastrophic casualties attempting the major objectives.\n\nI await Your Majesty's orders.\n\nDon Álvaro de Estúñiga\nCommander, Western Army\n\nYou set down the letters. The Master of Calatrava reads over your shoulder and lets out a long breath.\n\n\"Two fortresses in six weeks,\" he says. \"Not bad, but not the rapid coastal conquest we hoped for. Vélez-Málaga alone cost them three weeks.\"\n\nDon Fadrique nods grimly. \"Without artillery, every fortress becomes a grinding siege. They're learning what we learned centuries ago—you need bombards to break walls efficiently.\"\n\nThe Master looks at you. \"They're asking for the artillery, Your Majesty. And their argument is sound—with the five bombards, they could take Málaga in under a month. Without them, it's a bloodbath that might fail anyway.\"\n\n\"But,\" Don Fadrique counters, \"if we send the artillery west, we can't use it here in the east. We'd be back to traditional siege methods for Íllora or any other fortress we want to take.\"\n\nYou have a strategic choice to make:\n\nArtillery Allocation:\n\nSend the 5 bombards west to support the Málaga siege (enables major western success, but eastern operations become slower)\n\nKeep the bombards for eastern operations (enables efficient eastern sieges, but western army limited to small targets)\n\nSome other creative solution?\n\nWestern Army Orders:\n\nAttempt Málaga without artillery (high casualties, uncertain outcome)\n\nContinue with smaller coastal targets (steady progress, less risky)\n\nConsolidate current positions (defensive stance)\n\nWait for artillery before proceeding\n\nThe Master of Calatrava waits for your decision. \"Both fronts need the artillery, Your Majesty. But we only have one set of bombards.\"\n\nWhat are your orders?",

      "text": "This is strategically sound - Loja is between Alcalá and the coast, so taking it would create a land route to link the two armies. Then they could combine for a major push on Málaga.\n\nI should:\n1. Acknowledge the strategic plan\n2. Have commanders discuss it\n3. Send orders to the artillery in Jaén\n4. Send messengers to the western army with the plan\n5. Have commanders provide information about Loja (from the earlier intelligence)\n6. Describe the wait for artillery arrival\n7. Prepare for the march to Loja\n\nFrom the earlier project knowledge, I know:\n- Loja has 800-1,000 garrison\n- It's a major fortress, very strong\n- It's strategically positioned\n\nLet me narrate this properly.\n\nThe Strategic Decision\n\nYou study the situation for a moment, then look up at your commanders.\n\n\"We march southwest to Loja,\" you announce. \"We take the fortress with our artillery. Once Loja falls, we'll have a land route to the coast. Then we march to link up with the western fleet, combine our forces, and take Málaga together with the bombards.\"\n\nThe Master of Calatrava's eyes light up with understanding. \"Loja is the key. It sits between us and the coast—if we hold it, we can march an army to the western front without relying entirely on the fleet. And combining both armies for Málaga...\"\n\nDon Fadrique completes the thought: \"Nineteen thousand from here plus eighty-seven hundred from the west—twenty-seven thousand troops with artillery besieging Málaga. Granada couldn't possibly break that siege.\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" you say. \"Send word to the western army. Tell them to continue operations against smaller coastal targets—Salobreña, Almuñécar, whatever they can take with traditional siege methods. We'll handle Loja, then march to join them. Probably six to eight weeks from now, we combine forces at Málaga.\"\n\nThe Master nods approvingly. \"It's a sound strategy, Your Majesty. Aggressive but achievable. Loja is a hard target, but with artillery and our full force, we can take it.\"\n\nOrders Dispatched - May 20, Afternoon\n\nMessengers are sent immediately:\n\nTo Jaén (Master Gunner Pietro Calabrese):\n\nThe artillery is to march immediately to Alcalá la Real. Travel with all care and speed. Expected arrival May 25-26. Upon arrival, prepare for siege operations against Loja fortress. Full bombardment campaign anticipated.\n\nTo Western Army (Don Álvaro de Estúñiga):\n\nContinue coastal operations against smaller targets within your capability. Salobreña, Almuñécar, or other minor fortresses as opportunity presents. Avoid committing to major siege of Málaga.\n\nEastern army will besiege and take Loja fortress with artillery support. Upon Loja's fall (estimated 3-4 weeks), we will march west to link our armies. Combined force will then besiege Málaga with full artillery support.\n\nTimeline: Expect junction of forces late June or early July. Coordinate supply arrangements for combined operations.\n\nThe messengers depart with fresh horses and sealed orders bearing your seal.\n\nIntelligence Review: Loja\n\nThat evening, the Master of Calatrava convenes a council to review what's known about Loja. Don Rodrigo de Perea, who commanded the scout operations, presents the intelligence:\n\nLoja Fortress:\n\nLocation: Southwest of Alcalá la Real, approximately 25 miles. Sits on a strong defensive position controlling the Genil River valley and the road toward the coast.\n\nGarrison: 800-1,000 troops (from scout reports)\n\nMix of regular troops and local militia\n\nCommander unknown but assumed competent\n\nWell-supplied from Granada\n\nFortifications:\n\nMajor fortress with multiple wall circuits\n\nBuilt on high ground with natural defenses\n\nStrong towers and bastions\n\nWell-maintained (Granada has invested in its defense)\n\nConsidered one of Granada's key strongholds after the capital itself\n\nStrategic Importance:\n\nControls access between Granada and the western coast\n\nKey position on supply routes\n\nFall of Loja would open road to Málaga region\n\nPsychologically important—major fortress, well-known\n\nChallenges:\n\nStrong position (difficult approaches)\n\nLarge garrison (more troops than Alcalá had)\n\nWell-supplied (can sustain long siege)\n\nGranada might attempt to relieve it (it's important enough)\n\nEstimated Siege Duration:\nWith artillery: 3-4 weeks of bombardment, then assault\nWithout artillery: 8-12 weeks of starvation/mining, very costly\n\nDon Rodrigo concludes: \"It's a hard target, Your Majesty. Harder than Alcalá was. But with our full force, the artillery, and the lessons learned from previous sieges, it's achievable.\"\n\nThe Master adds: \"We should expect Granada to try something. They let Alcalá fall without relief, but Loja is more important. They might send what forces they can muster.\"\n\n\"Then we'll be ready for them,\" you reply.\n\nWaiting for Artillery - May 21-25\n\nFive days pass while the army waits for the artillery to arrive from Jaén. The time is not wasted.\n\nPreparations:\n\nSupply Organization:\nWagons are loaded with provisions for a three-to-four-week siege operation. Food, ammunition, tools, rope, lumber—everything needed for a major siege. The supply train grows to over two hundred wagons.\n\nForce Organization:\nThe army is restructured for the Loja operation:\n\nSiege force: 15,000 troops (main assault and siege works)\n\nScreening force: 4,000 cavalry and mobile infantry (protect against relief attempts)\n\nReserve: Minimal—most forces committed to the operation\n\nRoute Planning:\nScouts survey the road to Loja. It's 25 miles through territory that's theoretically under Castilian control after your recent operations, but guerrilla activity is still a concern. The march will take two days with the artillery and supply train.\n\nSiege Equipment:\nCarpenters begin prefabricating siege equipment—mantlets, scaling ladders, siege towers in sections that can be assembled on site. The work continues day and night.\n\nIntelligence Gathering:\nAdditional scouts are sent toward Loja to update intelligence on the garrison, defenses, and any Granada movements in the area.\n\nArtillery Arrival - May 25, Mid-Morning\n\nOn the fifth day, horns sound from the eastern approach. The artillery column has arrived.\n\nYou ride out with your commanders to meet them. The sight is impressive—five massive bronze bombards, each weighing over two tons, mounted on reinforced carriages. Each gun is pulled by a team of eight oxen, with spare teams following. Wagons loaded with gunpowder, stone shot, and equipment. Thirty gunners and assistants. Guards marching alongside.\n\nMaster Gunner Pietro Calabrese rides at the head of the column. He's a short, stocky man with powder burns on his hands and an intensely focused expression. He dismounts and bows.\n\n\"Your Majesty. Five bombards, fully operational, ready for siege operations. We made good time—five days from Jaén.\"\n\nYou clasp his shoulder. \"Welcome, Master Pietro. We have work for you. A fortress called Loja.\"\n\nPietro's eyes sharpen with professional interest. \"I know of it. Strong position. Stone walls. Good target for bombardment.\" He grins. \"We'll bring it down, Your Majesty.\"\n\nThe artillery trains into the fortress area and begins the process of unloading, checking equipment, and preparing for the march to Loja.\n\nFinal Preparations - May 25-26\n\nWith the artillery arrived, final preparations accelerate.\n\nWar Council - Evening, May 25:\n\nYou gather your senior commanders in Alcalá's main hall:\n\nMaster of Calatrava (Don Pedro González de Padilla)\n\nDon Fadrique Enríquez de Mendoza\n\nInfante Enrique\n\nMaster Gunner Pietro Calabrese\n\nDon García López de Padilla\n\nDon Rodrigo de Perea\n\nCaptain Fernán Alonso de Robles\n\nThe Master of Calatrava presents the operation plan:\n\nPhase One - March (2 days):\n\nMain army and artillery march southwest to Loja\n\nCavalry screens ahead and on flanks\n\nSupply train protected in center of column\n\nCamp defensively each night\n\nPhase Two - Investment (2-3 days):\n\nSurround fortress, establish siege lines\n\nPosition artillery (Pietro will select bombardment positions)\n\nBuild defensive works (protect against sorties and relief forces)\n\nOffer surrender terms (likely refused but required)\n\nPhase Three - Bombardment (2-3 weeks):\n\nSystematic bombardment of walls\n\nMining operations if opportunity presents\n\nMaintain blockade\n\nPrepare assault forces\n\nPhase Four - Assault (1-3 days):\n\nStorm breaches when walls sufficiently damaged\n\nHeavy fighting expected\n\nGarrison may surrender when breach is made, or may fight to the end\n\nExpected Duration: 3-4 weeks total from arrival to fortress fall\n\nExpected Casualties: 200-400 dead, 300-600 wounded (depending on assault intensity)\n\nPietro adds his assessment: \"The walls will fall, Your Majesty. Good stone construction, but nothing can withstand sustained bombardment. Three weeks of firing, maybe less if we get lucky with weak points. Then you storm the breaches.\"\n\nInfante Enrique speaks up: \"And if Granada sends a relief force?\"\n\nThe Master responds: \"We'll have four thousand cavalry and mobile infantry screening. Any relief force would have to fight through them to reach the siege lines. And Granada's field army is still assembling—they probably can't muster more than three or four thousand troops right now, not enough to challenge us.\"\n\nYou look around the table. \"Any objections? Concerns?\"\n\nSilence. Then Captain Fernán speaks: \"Just one question, Your Majesty. Do we offer the same terms as Alcalá? Conversion or departure?\"\n\nYou consider. \"Yes. Same terms. Anyone who wishes to convert and join us is welcome. Those who refuse may depart south with personal weapons. We're not here to slaughter—we're here to conquer.\"\n\nFray Hernando, present at the council, nods approvingly. \"The righteous path, Your Majesty.\"\n\nThe March Order - May 27, Dawn\n\nTwo days after the artillery arrived, the army is ready to march. Nineteen thousand troops, five bombards, two hundred supply wagons, and all the equipment of war.\n\nYou address the assembled army from horseback, wearing your white armor. The crusade banner streams beside you.\n\n\"Soldiers of Christ! We march to Loja! Another fortress will fall before the righteous might of this crusade! God has given us victory at Alcalá! He has given us victory at Granada's gates! Now He will give us victory at Loja!\"\n\nThe army roars approval.\n\n\"Forward! For Castile! For Christ! For victory!\"\n\nThe column begins to move—a river of men, horses, wagons, and bronze guns flowing southwest toward Loja.\n\nSTATUS SUMMARY - MAY 27, 1431\n\nDate: May 27, 1431 (Dawn)\nLocation: Departing Alcalá la Real, marching toward Loja\n\nForces:\n\nTotal: 19,000 troops\nInfantry: 12,000\n\nCavalry: 7,000\n\nArtillery: 5 medium bombards with full ammunition and powder\n\nSupply train: 200+ wagons\n\nMorale: Excellent\n\nRecent Victories:\n\nBattle of Granada (May 10): Enemy sortie force destroyed\n\nVega devastation: Granada's agriculture crippled\n\nWestern coast: Two fortresses taken (Vélez-Málaga, Nerja)\n\nObjective: Siege and capture of Loja fortress\n\nTimeline:\n\nMarch to Loja: 2 days (arrive May 28-29)\n\nSiege operations: 3-4 weeks\n\nExpected completion: Late June\n\nThen: March west to link with coastal army for Málaga operation\n\nWestern Army Status:\n\n8,700 combat-effective troops\n\nHolding Vélez-Málaga and Nerja\n\nOrders: Continue taking smaller coastal targets\n\nWill coordinate for combined Málaga operation\n\nGranada Situation:\n\nField forces destroyed\n\nAssembling reinforcements (won't be ready until late June/July)\n\nMay attempt to relieve Loja but lacks forces currently\n\nThe march to Loja begins.

The order of march is critical:\n\nVanguard: 1,000 light cavalry (scouts and advance guard)\nForward infantry: 3,000 troops (protect main column)\nArtillery and supply train: Center of column, heavily protected\nMain body: 12,000 infantry in marching formation\nFlanking cavalry: 3,000 heavy cavalry split between both sides\nRear guard: 3,000 cavalry and infantry (protect against pursuit)\n\nThe route: 25 miles southwest through territory that should be secure, but guerrilla activity remains a concern.\n\nCUSTOM D100 TABLE: MARCH TO LOJA\n\nFACTORS IN FAVOR (Pros):\n\nMassive force (19,000 troops) - extremely difficult to ambush successfully\n\nTerritory recently secured around Alcalá\n\nCounter-guerrilla operations reduced enemy activity in area\n\nStrong cavalry screens (4,000+ cavalry total)\n\nExperienced commanders and disciplined troops\n\nGood organization and march discipline\n\nGranada's field forces destroyed/scattered\n\nClear strategic objective and planned route\n\nFACTORS AGAINST (Cons):\n\nSlow-moving column due to artillery and supply train\n\nArtillery requires good roads and careful handling\n\n200+ wagon supply train is vulnerable and slows march\n\nGuerrilla forces still active in region\n\nTerrain may include difficult passages, river crossings\n\nColumn stretched over miles - hard to defend entire length\n\nGranada might attempt desperate harassment\n\nWeather could complicate operations\n\nAny delay alerts Loja garrison to prepare\n\n1-3: Catastrophic Disaster\nMajor coordinated ambush by 500-800 guerrillas at vulnerable point (river crossing or pass). Artillery column hit directly. One bombard damaged beyond field repair, another's ox team scattered. Heavy casualties (120-200 killed, 150-250 wounded). Supply wagons destroyed. Multiple delays. Arrive at Loja 4-5 days late with only 4 operational bombards and damaged morale. Strategic setback.\n\n4-8: Severe Problems\nLarge guerrilla ambush (300-500 raiders) hits supply train. Significant casualties (80-140 killed, 120-180 wounded). Artillery slowed by poor road conditions—one carriage breaks, requires 2 days to repair. Some supplies destroyed. Arrive 3 days late. Morale damaged. Granada has extra time to prepare Loja's defenses.\n\n9-16: Major Difficulties\nMultiple guerrilla attacks (150-300 total raiders). Moderate casualties (60-100 killed, 80-140 wounded). Artillery progress slowed by terrain/weather. One river crossing takes full day to get guns across. Supply wagons damaged. Arrive 2 days late (4 days total). Troops tired from fighting march. Granada alerted.\n\n17-26: Significant Issues\nSeveral guerrilla attacks (100-200 raiders total). Casualties moderate (40-70 killed, 60-100 wounded). Artillery movement slower than planned due to road conditions. Some supply difficulties. Arrive 1 day late (3 days total). Army intact but somewhat worn. Loja garrison fully alerted and prepared.\n\n27-40: Minor Problems\nSmall guerrilla harassment (50-100 raiders in scattered groups). Light casualties (20-40 killed, 30-60 wounded). Artillery moves slowly but steadily. Some delays at difficult terrain points. Arrive on schedule or slightly late (2-3 days). Army functional, minor wear and tear. Loja knows you're coming.\n\n41-58: Routine March\nOccasional guerrilla sightings but few attacks (20-40 raiders probe defenses). Minimal casualties (10-25 killed, 15-35 wounded). Artillery moves at expected pace. Normal march difficulties (terrain, weather). Arrive on schedule (2 days, evening May 28th). Army in good condition. Professional march execution.\n\n59-73: Smooth March\nLight guerrilla presence, easily driven off by screens. Very light casualties (5-15 killed, 10-20 wounded). Artillery moves well, roads better than expected. Good march pace. Arrive on schedule in good condition (2 days, afternoon May 28th). Troops fresh and ready. Efficient operation.\n\n74-85: Efficient Operation\nMinimal guerrilla activity (scouts spot and avoid). Trivial casualties (2-8 killed, 5-12 wounded from accidents/sickness). Artillery moves smoothly, excellent route selection. Arrive slightly ahead of schedule (early May 28th). Army in excellent condition. Textbook march execution.\n\n86-93: Excellent March\nNo guerrilla encounters (cavalry screens intimidate or intercept). Minimal casualties (0-4 killed, 2-8 wounded from accidents). Artillery moves faster than planned. Perfect weather and terrain. Arrive significantly ahead of schedule (evening May 27th, just 1 day). Army fresh, morale high. Outstanding logistics.\n\n94-97: Near-Perfect Execution\nZero enemy contact. No casualties except minor accidents (0-2 wounded). Artillery exceeds expectations. Superb route, weather, and organization. Arrive morning May 28th. Catch Loja partially unprepared. Army in peak condition. Exceptional professional performance.\n\n98-100: Flawless Campaign March\nPerfect execution. Zero casualties, zero delays. Artillery moves like clockwork. Surprise some Loja scouts who didn't expect this speed. Arrive late May 27th (evening, 1.5 days). Complete surprise achieved. Loja garrison not fully prepared. Army fresh and eager. Historic march efficiency. Immediate tactical advantage.\n\nPlease roll d100 for the march to Loja.",

      "text": "The March to Loja - Day One, May 27th\n\nThe column departs Alcalá at dawn. Nineteen thousand troops, five bronze bombards, two hundred wagons. The crusade banner leads the way, your white armor visible at the head of the main body.\n\nThe first hours go well. The road is decent, the weather clear. The artillery moves at its steady pace—slow but manageable. The oxen strain against their harnesses, the massive bronze guns creaking on their carriages. Pietro Calabrese rides alongside his precious bombards, watching every wheel turn, every stress point on the carriages.\n\nBy mid-morning, the vanguard is eight miles ahead of the artillery. The column has stretched to nearly three miles long—impossible to defend every point simultaneously, but the cavalry screens are alert and professional.\n\nFirst Contact - Late Morning\n\nA messenger gallops back from the vanguard. \"Your Majesty! Guerrillas ahead—sixty to eighty raiders blocking the road at a river crossing. They've burned the bridge.\"\n\nYou ride forward with Captain Fernán and a company of cavalry. The scene is clear when you arrive: a stone bridge over a tributary stream, partially collapsed. The wooden deck has been torched, stones pulled down. On the far side, Moorish light cavalry watch from a safe distance—maybe seventy men, armed with bows and javelins.\n\nThe stream isn't deep, but it's wide enough and the banks steep enough that the artillery and wagons will have difficulty crossing without the bridge.\n\nDon García López de Padilla, commanding the vanguard, has already deployed troops. \"We can ford it with the cavalry and infantry, Your Majesty. But the guns and wagons need a better crossing. We'll have to repair the bridge or find an alternative ford.\"\n\nYou order the vanguard across to secure the far bank. The infantry splashes through the stream, shields up against arrows from the distant raiders. A few men take arrows—one killed, four wounded—but the vanguard establishes a defensive position on the far side. The guerrillas fade back into the hills rather than face your force.\n\nBut the artillery is stuck. Pietro examines the bridge and shakes his head. \"Need to rebuild the deck, Your Majesty. Three hours minimum, maybe four.\"\n\nThere's no choice. Engineers and work parties are brought forward. Timber is cut from nearby trees. Under heavy guard—the guerrillas are still out there—the bridge is repaired. The work takes four and a half hours.\n\nIt's mid-afternoon before the artillery begins crossing. Each gun must be taken over carefully, oxen straining, men pushing. One bombard's wheel catches on a stone and nearly tips—Pietro screams orders, men throw their weight against the carriage, and disaster is barely avoided.\n\nThe crossing is complete by evening. You've covered only twelve miles—half the expected distance for the first day.\n\nNight Camp - May 27th\n\nThe army camps in open country, still ten miles from Loja. Defensive perimeter established, guards posted heavily. Everyone knows the guerrillas are out there, watching.\n\nThe Master of Calatrava reviews the day with you. \"The bridge burning was coordinated, Your Majesty. They knew our route and our timing. There are more of them operating in this area than the scouts reported.\"\n\n\"Can we reach Loja tomorrow?\" you ask.\n\n\"If nothing else goes wrong,\" he says. \"But I suspect they're not done with us.\"\n\nDay Two, May 28th - The Road to Hell\n\nThe march resumes before dawn. Everyone is alert, tense. The road ahead winds through increasingly rough terrain—rocky hills, narrow passages. Perfect ambush country.\n\nMorning - The Canyon Attack\n\nAround mid-morning, the road enters a narrow defile between two hills. The vanguard is through, but the main column and artillery are committed to the passage when war cries erupt from both sides.\n\nGuerrillas—perhaps a hundred men—appear on the heights and loose arrows and javelins down into the column. They're not trying to stand and fight—just hit and fade, inflict casualties, and disappear before your cavalry can reach them.\n\nThe attack focuses on the supply train. Arrows rain down on the wagons. Oxen bellow and panic. Drivers are hit. One wagon catches fire from a flaming arrow—men rush to extinguish it while under continued fire.\n\nYour flanking cavalry spurs up the hillsides to drive off the attackers, but the terrain is steep and rocky. By the time they reach the heights, most of the guerrillas have melted away. A few are caught and killed, but most escape.\n\nThe damage: Eight soldiers dead, fifteen wounded. Three wagon drivers killed. Four wagons damaged, one destroyed. Two oxen dead, five injured. And worst of all—one of the artillery carriages took a hit. A javelin struck one of the oxen pulling a bombard. The animal panicked, veered sideways, and the massive gun lurched. The carriage's axle cracked.\n\nPietro is beside himself. \"God damn them! Three hours to repair, maybe more. And we're exposed here!\"\n\nThe column is halted in the defile while repairs are made. Guards deployed on the heights. Everyone scanning for another attack. The engineers work frantically, but replacing an axle on a two-ton gun carriage takes time.\n\nTwo more guerrilla probes during the repair work—arrows from distance, quickly driven off by your archers, but enough to wound six more men and kill another ox.\n\nThe repair is completed by early afternoon. The column moves forward again, but now everyone is jumpy, exhausted from constant vigilance.\n\nCasualties so far: 16 killed, 36 wounded\n\nAfternoon - The Ambush on the Artillery\n\nThe worst comes in mid-afternoon. The terrain opens up somewhat—rolling hills, scattered olive groves. The artillery is moving through a relatively flat section when a larger force hits.\n\nSeventy to eighty guerrillas, this time more organized and aggressive. They strike from an olive grove directly at the artillery column itself. Not hit-and-run this time—a genuine assault attempting to reach the guns.\n\nThe guards react immediately, forming a protective wall around the bombards. Fierce fighting erupts—hand-to-hand combat within fifty yards of the guns. You spur forward with your household guard, Garcia and Rodrigo at your sides.\n\nThe fighting is brutal but brief. The guerrillas are brave but outnumbered and outmatched once your cavalry reinforcements arrive. They're driven off after maybe ten minutes of combat, leaving thirty dead behind. But they achieved their purpose—more delays, more casualties, more exhaustion.\n\nYour losses: Nineteen soldiers killed, twenty-three wounded. And Pietro reports that during the fighting, one of the bombard's wheels was damaged—not destroyed, but weakened. \"It'll hold, Your Majesty,\" he says grimly, \"but we need to move slowly. Any hard jolt could break it.\"\n\nWhich means the artillery pace slows even further.\n\nEvening - The Crossing\n\nBy late afternoon, the column reaches another obstacle—a river crossing, this one wider and deeper than the morning's stream. The bridge here is intact, but it's old and narrow. The bombards must cross one at a time, and each crossing must be done with extreme care.\n\nThe process is agonizingly slow. Test the bridge. Cross the first gun—fifteen minutes of careful movement, oxen straining. Position it on the far side. Bring up the second gun. Repeat.\n\nDuring the second gun's crossing, the weakened wheel that was damaged in the afternoon attack finally gives way. The carriage lurches, men shout, the gun tilts dangerously. For a terrifying moment it looks like it will crash through the bridge, but Pietro's crew manages to stop it. Emergency repairs on the bridge itself. Another two hours lost.\n\nIt's full dark by the time the last elements of the column cross the river. You're still five miles from Loja—too far to reach tonight.\n\nNight Camp - May 28th\n\nThe army camps for a second night, exhausted and bloodied. The guerrilla harassment has stopped—they've done their job—but everyone is on edge. Guards are posted heavily. Fires are kept minimal.\n\nThe Master of Calatrava tallies the casualties: 43 dead, 87 wounded from two days of march. Not catastrophic, but painful. More importantly, the army is worn. The constant alertness, the repeated attacks, the delays—all have taken their toll on morale and energy.\n\nPietro reports all five bombards are intact and functional, but the repairs have been makeshift. \"We'll need proper workshop time after this siege, Your Majesty. These guns have taken a beating.\"\n\nThe supply situation is also concerning. Four wagons were destroyed or too damaged to continue. Some supplies were lost. Nothing critical, but the margins are tighter than planned.\n\nDon Fadrique visits your tent that evening. \"They're good,\" he says quietly. \"Those guerrilla commanders. They knew exactly where to hit us, when to hit us, how to maximize delay and casualties without risking decisive engagement. Professional work.\"\n\n\"Will they hit us tomorrow?\" you ask.\n\n\"Doubt it. We're too close to Loja now. They've done their job—alerted the garrison, cost us time and blood, worn us down. Now they'll fade back and let the fortress do the work.\"\n\nDay Three, May 29th - Arrival at Loja\n\nThe final march begins at dawn. Just five miles to Loja, but everyone is tense, expecting another attack.\n\nIt doesn't come.\n\nThe guerrillas are gone—pulled back, mission accomplished. The road is clear. The column moves unopposed through the morning.\n\nBy mid-morning, Loja appears on the horizon.\n\nThe fortress is impressive. Built on high ground overlooking the Genil River valley, its walls are thick stone rising thirty feet high. Multiple towers punctuate the walls. A strong gate faces your approach. The red banner of Granada flies from every tower—defiant.\n\nAnd the walls are crowded with defenders. Hundreds of them, perhaps the entire garrison. They've been watching your approach for hours—maybe days, alerted by the guerrillas. They're ready.\n\nAs your column approaches to about half a mile from the fortress, you can see activity on the walls. Officers organizing troops. Weapons being positioned. The garrison is at full alert, fully prepared, and determined to resist.\n\nA single war horn sounds from the fortress—long, defiant, echoing across the valley. The message is clear: We are ready. Come and take us if you can.\n\nThe Master of Calatrava rides up beside you. \"They know we're coming, Your Majesty. They're prepared. This won't be easy.\"\n\nYou survey the fortress and the surrounding terrain. Strong position. Prepared defenders. And your own army is tired, worn from three days of harassment.\n\nBut you have nineteen thousand troops and five bombards. The fortress will fall. It's just a question of time and blood.\n\nArrival - Afternoon, May 29th\n\nThe army deploys around Loja systematically. This isn't your first siege—lessons from Alcalá have been learned.\n\nDeployment:\n\nInfantry establishes siege lines surrounding three sides of the fortress (fourth side protected by steep terrain)\n\nCavalry screens patrol the outer perimeter\n\nArtillery positions are scouted by Pietro—he selects a flat area 350 yards from the western wall\n\nSupply camp is established with heavy guards\n\nDefensive earthworks are begun immediately\n\nThe work continues into the evening. Trenches are dug. Stakes are cut and sharpened. The siege infrastructure begins to take shape.\n\nFrom the walls, the defenders watch. No sorties—they're not that foolish against nineteen thousand troops—but constant vigilance. You can see archers, crossbowmen, officers. The garrison is professional and alert.\n\nAs darkness falls, your camp spreads across the valley—thousands of campfires, the army settling in for what everyone knows will be weeks of hard work.\n\nFray Hernando conducts evening prayers. The troops are weary but determined. You've reached Loja. Now comes the hard part.\n\nSTATUS SUMMARY - MAY 29, 1431 (Evening)\n\nDate: May 29, 1431 (Evening)\nLocation: Besieging Loja fortress\n\nArmy Status:\n\nTotal: 19,000 troops (minus casualties)\n\nCasualties from march: 43 killed, 87 wounded\n\nCondition: Worn and tired from three-day fighting march\n\nMorale: Solid but not excellent—men are weary\n\nSupplies: Adequate but reduced from attacks\n\nArtillery:\n\n5 bombards operational but needing maintenance\n\nAll crews intact\n\nAmmunition and powder adequate\n\nEquipment somewhat worn from rough march\n\nLoja Fortress:\n\nGarrison: 800-1,000 troops (estimated, appears at full strength)\n\nDefenses: Strong, well-maintained\n\nStatus: Fully alerted and prepared\n\nCommander: Unknown, but appears competent\n\nMorale: Appears high—defiant\n\nSiege Status:\n\nInvestment beginning\n\nArtillery positions being prepared\n\nDefensive works under construction\n\nExpected bombardment start: 2-3 days (May 31-June 1)\n\nExpected siege duration: 3-4 weeks from now\n\nGranada Context:\n\nGuerrilla operations successful—delayed arrival, inflicted casualties\n\nLoja fully prepared for siege\n\nGranada knows eastern army is committed here\n\nUnknown if relief force will be attempted\n\nThe siege of Loja has begun.

Tomorrow the real work begins.\n\nCHAPTER 19 SUMMARY\n\nMajor Events\n\nThe Challenge at Granada (May 10, 1431)\n\nJuan challenged Sultan Muhammad IX at Granada's gates with 300-man escort\n\nSultan launched full sortie force (2,500-3,000 troops) as planned\n\nCastilian counter-trap executed adequately—hidden infantry emerged, reinforcements phased in properly\n\nDecisive victory: Enemy sortie destroyed\n\nCastilian casualties: 87 killed, 143 wounded\n\nMoorish casualties: ~2,000 killed/wounded/captured, only 400-500 escaped\n\nSultan's field force effectively destroyed\n\nDevastation of the Vega (May 11)\n\nSystematic destruction of Granada's agricultural infrastructure\n\n600-800 acres of grain destroyed\n\n35 mills destroyed or damaged\n\nIrrigation systems damaged (later preserved on Juan's order)\n\nVillages and civilians spared\n\nGranada's food supply for 1431 severely compromised\n\nReturn to Alcalá (May 12)\n\nArmy returned with 580 prisoners\n\nHero's welcome, morale at campaign high\n\nFour days of rest and recovery\n\nStrategic planning for next operations\n\nIntelligence Gathering (May 13-20)\n\nArtillery confirmed operational in Jaén (ready May 11)\n\nWestern army reports received: Modest success\nVélez-Málaga taken (April 2-22): 120 killed, 183 wounded\n\nNerja taken (May 5-10): 43 killed, 71 wounded\n\nTwo coastal fortresses secured\n\nArmy requesting artillery for Málaga operation\n\nStrategic Decision\n\nJuan decides to take Loja fortress with artillery\n\nPlan: Link eastern army with western fleet after Loja falls\n\nCombined force to besiege Málaga together\n\nWestern army ordered to continue small coastal targets meanwhile\n\nMarch to Loja (May 27-29)\n\nThree-day march with significant guerrilla harassment\n\nBridge destroyed, multiple ambushes, artillery damaged\n\nCasualties: 43 killed, 87 wounded\n\nArrival delayed by one day\n\nLoja garrison fully alerted and prepared\n\nSiege investment begun May 29\n\nKey Themes\n\nPersonal Leadership and Risk\nJuan's letter to Isabel acknowledges the risks he's taking fighting alongside his troops. His visible presence at Granada's gates and throughout the campaign continues building his reputation as a warrior-king, but he recognizes this cannot last forever.\n\nStrategic Flexibility\nRather than committing to either eastern or western operations separately, Juan crafted a strategy to combine both—using Loja as the key to linking the armies for a joint assault on Málaga.\n\nGuerrilla Warfare\nGranada's guerrilla forces proved effective at harassment, inflicting casualties and delays even against overwhelming force. The march to Loja demonstrated that Granada still has teeth even after field army destruction.\n\nMeasured Destruction\nJuan's order to preserve irrigation systems shows strategic thinking—destroying what helps Granada now but will serve Castile later. Balancing immediate military necessity with long-term conquest goals.\n\nI'll now create the comprehensive game state document.\n\nCreate File: Creating comprehensive game state document for end of Chapter 19, including all military forces, strategic situation, treasury status, and current operations as of May 29, 1431\n\nI've created a comprehensive game state document for the end of Chapter 19.\n\nView Game State - May 29, 1431\n\nThe document includes:\n\nComplete military force dispositions (both eastern and western armies)\n\nRecent victories and casualties\n\nGranada's estimated situation and forces\n\nTreasury and financial status (with note that you maintain detailed records externally)\n\nAll key personnel and relationships\n\nCurrent siege status at Loja\n\nStrategic outlook and planned operations\n\nDiplomatic situation\n\nPrisoners and conversions\n\nLogistical status\n\nChapter 19 Summary:\n\nChallenged Sultan at Granada's gates → Decisive victory (enemy sortie destroyed)\n\nDevastated the Vega → Granada's food supply crippled\n\nReceived western army reports → Two coastal fortresses taken\n\nDecided on Loja strategy → Link armies for combined Málaga assault\n\nMarched to Loja → Guerrilla harassment but arrived successfully\n\nSiege of Loja begins → May 29, 1431\n\nThe campaign continues.

Juan II - location changed to besieging Loja, age should be 18 (not 19), added new combat experience\n2. Isabel - potentially pregnant, Juan sent her a letter giving option to return to Toledo\n3. Captain Fernán - definitely at Loja, commanded Juan's 300-man escort\n4. Rodrigo (Captain) and García (Sergeant) - both at Loja, both at Juan's side during battle\n5. Sir Thomas - location unknown, wasn't specifically mentioned\n6. Master of Calatrava - at Loja, confidence fully restored after Granada victory\n7. Infante Enrique - at Loja, given reserve command at Alcalá\n8. Rodrigo Manrique and Infante Juan - with western army, need to add Don Álvaro de Estúñiga as western commander\n9. Fray Hernando - at Loja\n10. Pietro Calabrese - at Loja with repaired artillery\n11. Need to add new characters: Don Fadrique Enríquez de Mendoza, Don García López de Padilla, Don Rodrigo de Perea, Ahmad al-Zarqali\n12. Update last updated date and crusade status\n\nLet me make these updates systematically.\n\nEdit: Updating the header with new date\n\nThe exact string might have slight differences. Let me check the exact formatting by viewing just that section.\n\nI see - there's a special character issue with \"Alcalá\". Let me try again with the correct characters.\n\nEdit: Updating Juan II's information with Chapter 19 events\n\nEdit: Updating Isabel's information with pregnancy and letter from Juan\n\nNow update Sir Thomas, Marco, Master of Calatrava, Master of Santiago, Infante Enrique, Fray Hernando, and Pietro Calabrese. Then add new characters.\n\nEdit: Updating Sir Thomas location\n\nNow update Master of Calatrava with his restored confidence and current location.\n\nEdit: Updating Master of Calatrava with restored confidence and current operations\n\nThought process\n\nLet me check the exact text in that section.\n\nEdit: Updating Master of Calatrava with restored confidence and current operations\n\nThought process\n\nThe special characters must be different. Let me try a different approach - I'll use bash to do a search and replace with sed.\n\nIt's at line 130. Let me try to replace multiple lines at once using a larger section replacement. Let me view lines 130-141 to get the exact text.\n\nI see the issue - there are special non-ASCII characters like \"Ã¡\" and \"Ã\". Let me try a different approach and just replace the \"Current Location\" and \"Current Task\" lines which should be easier, then add new key facts.\n\nEdit: Updating Master of Calatrava location and task\n\nThe character encoding is clearly an issue. Let me use a bash script to do these replacements more carefully.\n\nGood! Now I need to add the new characters from Chapter 19. Let me add them after the existing military commanders section. I should add:\n- Don Fadrique Enríquez de Mendoza (cavalry commander at Loja)\n- Don Álvaro de Estúñiga (western army commander)\n- Don García López de Padilla (vanguard commander)\n- Don Rodrigo de Perea (scout operations commander)\n- Ahmad al-Zarqali (converted qadi)\n\nLet me find a good insertion point.\n\nGood! Now I need to update the Crusade Status Summary at the end of the document to reflect the current situation. Let me check what's there now.\n\nThe file is 837 lines. Let me check the end.\n\nGreat! Now let me verify the updates were made correctly by viewing a few key sections.\n\nPerfect! Let me check that the new commanders were added correctly.\n\nHmm, it seems the new commanders weren't added. Let me check what happened.\n\nThe location/task updates weren't made either. Let me check if the Python script worked at all. Let me look at line 191-192 to see if Infante Enrique's current location was updated.\n\nThe updates didn't work. The issue is the character encoding doesn't match. Let me try a different approach - let me manually create the updated sections using proper escaping.\n\nGood! Now let me add the new commanders by inserting them after Infante Enrique's section (after line 192, before line 194 which is the ---).\n\nGreat! Now let me verify this worked and also complete the updates to the other characters. Let me check Pietro Calabrese's section to update it properly.\n\nGood!
