Based on the skill instructions, I need to pick up exactly where we left off - in the birthing chamber shortly after the birth, with Lucia resting and Juan there.\n\nI should NOT advance time beyond where the last chapter ended. The chapter ended \"shortly after birth\" with Juan visiting.\n\nLet me write the chapter introduction.\n\nChapter 2.42\n\nNovember 1436, Shortly After Dawn\n\nThe birthing chamber holds the quiet that follows great effort. Clean linens have replaced the soiled ones, and the room smells of lavender and the particular warmth of new life. Princess Juana sleeps in her cradle near the bed, dark hair already thick like her mother's, her tiny fingers curled in the unconscious grip of infants.\n\nQueen Lucia reclines against banked pillows, exhausted but alert. The color has returned to her face—the midwives remarked on her remarkable constitution. Three children in three years of marriage, each delivery smoother than the last, each recovery swifter. She watches you with grey-green eyes that hold both tenderness and that particular sharpness she has never lost, even in moments like these.\n\nThe chief midwife and her assistants move quietly at the edges of the room, tidying instruments and preparing the posset wine that will help Lucia's milk come in. Through the narrow windows, the first grey light of a November morning seeps into Toledo.\n\nLucia has just spoken: \"After her father. You are not usually so vain, my lord.\" Her voice carries the affectionate teasing that has become the foundation of your marriage.",

      "text": "Actually, I recall from the chapter summary that there's mention of \"Alfonso V Poisoning Plot: Isaac monitoring health; ring prepared; Barcelona meeting = first opportunity.\" So Isaac is involved in some kind of poisoning plot against Alfonso V.\n\nLet me search the project knowledge for more information about Isaac.\n\nNow Juan is calling for Isaac while still in the birthing chamber with Lucia. This is interesting - he wants to discuss something privately, possibly about the upcoming Barcelona meeting where the first poisoning opportunity will occur in spring 1437.\n\nLet me write a response where Lucia reacts to Juan calling for Isaac (which is unusual in a birthing chamber), and then Isaac arrives.\n\nLucia's eyebrow rises—that particular arch you have come to know well. \"Isaac? Now?\" She glances at the sleeping infant, at the midwives still bustling about their quiet tasks. \"You wish to speak with your shadow-man while the sheets still carry the scent of labor?\"\n\nHer voice carries no accusation, only the wry observation of a woman who knows her husband's mind turns to business even in moments of tenderness. She shifts against the pillows, wincing slightly at a twinge of discomfort.\n\n\"Go, then. I will not be lonely.\" She nods toward the cradle. \"Juana and I have much to discuss about the questionable judgment of naming oneself after one's father. And you—\" a tired smile, \"—you have been still too long already. I can see it. Whatever you are planning, it has been building behind your eyes these past months.\"\n\nShe reaches for your hand, squeezes it once. \"Send word when you are ready for the world to meet your daughter. The Archbishop will want to discuss her baptism.\"\n\nYou find Isaac in his customary place—not quite in the royal quarters, not quite in the servants' passages, but in the small chamber between them that most men would not even notice existed. He rises when you enter, his movements economical as always. The years have worn at him—more grey in his beard now, deeper lines around those watchful eyes—but the sharpness remains undiminished.\n\n\"Your Majesty.\" A slight bow. \"I am told there is another princess in the world. Congratulations.\"\n\nHe waits. Isaac has never been one to fill silence unnecessarily.",

      "text": "Isaac's expression does not change. He moves to the door, checks the passage beyond, then closes it with a soft click. When he speaks, his voice drops to something barely above a breath.\n\n\"I have it.\"\n\nHe reaches into his doublet and produces a small wooden box, unremarkable in every way—the sort of thing that might hold a signet ring or a minor keepsake. He opens it to reveal a ring of modest gold, set with a dark stone that might be onyx or jet. Nothing that would draw a second glance on a king's hand.\n\n\"The stone twists.\" He demonstrates, and you see the tiny compartment beneath—a hollow no larger than a pea. \"One full turn to the left, press, and the spring releases a single drop. The compound is colorless. In wine, it is undetectable. In food with strong spices—Aragonese cooking, Neapolitan fare—equally so.\"\n\nHe closes the box and sets it on the small table between you.\n\n\"Instructions.\" His dark eyes meet yours. \"Never more than one drop per encounter. The compound accumulates in the liver and kidneys. Given what we know of Alfonso's existing damage—the fevers, the drinking, the old wounds that never healed properly—the symptoms will be indistinguishable from the natural progression of a body worn by years of campaign and excess.\"\n\nIsaac pauses, weighing his next words.\n\n\"Three encounters, perhaps four, spread over two years. More frequent, and a skilled physician might notice a pattern. Less frequent, and the body may clear what has been given. Barcelona in spring. Then Naples or Rome when opportunity presents. Then again a year hence.\" He spreads his hands slightly. \"By the time Alfonso's health fails—and it will fail—no one will think to look for a cause beyond what everyone already whispers: that the King of Aragon has lived too hard and too recklessly.\"\n\nHe reaches into his doublet again and produces a smaller vial, no larger than a woman's fingernail.\n\n\"This refills the compartment. Three doses remain after the ring is loaded. Keep it somewhere no servant will find it—not with your medicines, not with your jewelry. Somewhere only you know.\"\n\nIsaac's voice carries no judgment now. That conversation happened months ago, in the darkness of a Toledo night. He made his reservations known; you made your decision. Now there is only the work.\n\n\"The ring is designed to be worn daily. If you wear it only when meeting Alfonso, someone may eventually notice the pattern. Wear it always, or not at all.\"\n\nHe falls silent, waiting.",

So this is consistent with what was planned.\n\nLucia would likely want to come - she's traveled with Juan before (Rome, Constantinople, Naples). She's politically savvy and would understand the diplomatic importance of meeting Alfonso V and María. She might have practical concerns about the newborn, but she's shown herself to be adaptable.\n\nLet me write this scene. First, the moment of putting on the ring - this should be significant, a crossing of a threshold. Then the conversation with Lucia about Barcelona.\n\nI should stop after Lucia responds to give the player a chance to react.\n\nThe ring slides onto your finger—the fourth finger of your right hand, where it sits beside the heavier signet of Castile. The weight is negligible. The stone catches no particular light. A modest ornament that a king might wear without comment, that courtiers might glance at and forget.\n\nYou flex your hand, feel the slight difference in balance. From this moment forward, you carry death in a twist of gold and onyx.\n\nIsaac watches you, says nothing. When you dismiss him, he bows and vanishes into whatever shadows he inhabits.\n\nYou return to the birthing chamber as the morning light strengthens. Lucia has dozed, but she stirs when you enter, grey-green eyes finding you with that particular alertness that even exhaustion cannot dim.\n\n\"That was brief,\" she murmurs. \"Either very good news or very bad.\"\n\nWhen you settle beside her and ask about Barcelona, her expression shifts—consideration replacing drowsiness. She glances toward the cradle where Juana sleeps, then back to you.\n\n\"Barcelona in spring. Four months hence.\" She calculates silently—you can see her doing it. \"Juana will be old enough to travel, if we go slowly. And the others...\" A slight smile. \"Fernando has never met his aunt María. Catalina will charm Alfonso into giving her half of Aragon if we're not careful.\"\n\nShe reaches up, touches your face with fingers still pale from the ordeal of birth.\n\n\"You want us there. All of us.\" It is not quite a question. \"This is not merely a family visit, is it? You are showing Alfonso something. The dynasty. The future.\"\n\nHer eyes search yours. Lucia has always seen more than you intended to show.\n\n\"I will come. We will all come. But tell me, husband—\" her voice drops, \"—what are you truly planning with my children's uncle?\"",

Let me check. The chapter summary says Juana was born Nov/Dec 1436. Spring 1437 is about 4-5 months later. Lucia probably isn't pregnant again yet, or if she is, it would be very early.\n\nActually, let me not assume pregnancy. The last chapter ended with Juana's birth in Nov/Dec 1436. We're now moving to Spring 1437 for Barcelona.\n\nFor a royal progress with small children, they'd travel maybe 20-30 km per day, so this would be a journey of 3-4 weeks.\n\nRisks on this journey:\n- Weather (spring storms, flooding)\n- Illness (children, Lucia recovering, disease)\n- Bandits (unlikely for royal party but possible)\n- Accidents (carriages, horses)\n- Political incidents (assassination attempts, local unrest)\n- News from elsewhere (Constantinople, Ottoman movements, papal matters)\n- Family drama (children's health, tantrums, minor issues)\n\nI'll design a chaos roll table that captures the journey's complexity. The table needs to reflect the high-stakes nature of traveling with young children and the political tension of meeting Alfonso V. I'll create a nuanced system where each roll reveals potential challenges or unexpected opportunities, balancing risk and narrative development.\n\nLucia studies your face for a long moment. Whatever she sees there—or whatever she chooses not to see—she accepts with a slow nod.\n\n\"The Sultan. The future. Family bonds.\" She settles back against the pillows. \"You have never lied to me, Juan. I do not think you are lying now. But I think there are rooms in your mind you have not shown me.\"\n\nHer hand finds yours, squeezes once.\n\n\"I will trust you. As I have trusted you since that first night in Toledo when you told me of empires and asked me to build one with you.\" A tired smile. \"Wake me when Juana needs feeding. And send word to the household—we travel to Barcelona in spring.\"\n\nSpring 1437\n\nThe winter passes. Juana grows from a sleeping bundle into a bright-eyed infant who watches the world with her mother's grey-green intensity. The children are prepared for travel—Fernando now nearly four, serious and watchful; Catalina five and imperious; Bianca and Teresa young enough to need nurses but old enough to be curious about the great carts and horses being assembled.\n\nIn late March, the royal household departs Toledo. The column stretches for nearly a quarter mile: the royal family in cushioned carriages, guards in Castilian colors, wagons of luggage and supplies, nurses and servants and officials. You wear the ring daily now, as Isaac instructed. It has become as familiar as your own skin.\n\nThe road to Barcelona runs northeast through Guadalajara, then Zaragoza, then the long descent through Aragon to the sea.\n\nCHAOS ROLL: The Journey to Barcelona\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-5\nDisaster. Serious illness strikes the royal party—one of the children falls gravely ill, or an accident injures a member of the family. The journey is delayed by weeks. Arrive in Barcelona under a shadow.\n6-15\nMisfortune. Spring rains turn roads to mire; a carriage breaks an axle in the mountains; one of the younger children develops a fever that passes but delays travel. Arrive late, exhausted, and out of sorts. Alfonso's first impression is of a harried family, not a confident dynasty.\n16-30\nDifficult passage. Minor troubles accumulate—muddy roads, a lame horse, children's tantrums, a cold that passes through the nurses. Nothing serious, but the journey is wearing. Arrive tired but intact.\n31-50\nUneventful. The journey passes without notable incident. Spring weather holds, roads are passable, children behave adequately. Arrive on schedule, presentable, ready for diplomacy.\n51-70\nPleasant journey. Good weather, good roads, warm welcomes in the towns you pass. The children enjoy the adventure. Fernando asks intelligent questions about Aragon; Catalina performs for local notables who are charmed. Arrive in good spirits, well-rested.\n71-85\nTriumphant progress. The journey becomes a display of Trastámara strength. Crowds gather to see the royal family; local lords pay their respects; the children shine. Alfonso receives reports of your approach that paint a picture of a flourishing dynasty. Arrive with momentum and prestige.\n86-95\nUnexpected advantage. Something fortunate occurs en route—important news reaches you first, a useful contact is made, or a diplomatic opportunity presents itself. Arrive in Barcelona with more than you departed with.\n96-100\nExceptional fortune. The journey itself becomes legendary—a perfect progress that demonstrates the vitality of Castile and the unity of the Trastámara line. Stories of the royal children precede you; Alfonso is already impressed before you arrive. Additionally, some unexpected boon presents itself.\n\nRoll when ready.",

      "text": "The spring of 1437 unfolds like a tapestry woven in Castile's favor.\n\nYou depart Toledo in late March under skies scrubbed clean by overnight rain, the roads firm enough for travel but not yet baked to summer dust. The column moves at the pace of the youngest children—steady, unhurried, a king who has time enough to show his realm to his heirs.\n\nFernando, not yet four, insists on riding. You place him before you on your own horse for the first league out of Toledo, his small hands gripping the pommel with fierce concentration. He does not laugh or shout as other children might. He studies—the movement of the horse, the way you hold the reins, the rhythm of hooves on packed earth.\n\n\"When can I have my own horse, Father?\" he asks, voice serious.\n\n\"When your legs are long enough to reach the stirrups.\"\n\nHe considers this, nods once, and returns to his study of horsemanship.\n\nCatalina, by contrast, holds court from the carriage. At five years old, she has already learned that a window makes a stage. When you pass through villages, she waves with precisely calibrated grace—not too eager, not too remote. The peasants who line the roads to watch the royal procession pass find themselves waving back at a little girl with dark curls and her mother's bearing, and they remember it.\n\nGuadalajara\n\nThe Mendoza receive you with full honors. Don Íñigo López de Mendoza—poet, warrior, and patriarch of one of Castile's great houses—rides out personally to escort you into the city. His eyes miss nothing: the healthy children, the beautiful queen, the king who wears his authority as easily as his plain traveling clothes.\n\n\"Your Majesty's family does credit to the realm,\" he says, and means it.\n\nThat night, at a modest banquet, Catalina sings. Word has spread of her gift since the Portuguese visit, and Don Íñigo requests the honor. She performs the same lullaby—Duérmete, niño pequeño—and the great hall falls silent. When she finishes, Don Íñigo's wife weeps openly.\n\n\"The House of Trastámara,\" Don Íñigo murmurs to you afterward, \"has been blessed beyond measure.\"\n\nZaragoza\n\nYou enter Aragon proper, and here the welcome shifts—still warm, but watching. These are Alfonso's lands in all but name, administered in his absence by men loyal to the Aragonese crown. They receive you correctly, formally, with the precise hospitality owed to a fellow sovereign who is also their king's brother-in-law and heir.\n\nBut the children break through formality.\n\nFernando, riding now on a small palfrey led by a groom, draws admiration from the Aragonese knights. He sits his horse like a boy twice his age, back straight, eyes forward. \"A warrior born,\" one of them says, loud enough for you to hear. They do not know about his reluctance with blades, his preference for books. They see only the magnificent physical presence—Juan's chin, Isabel's eyes, and something else entirely his own.\n\nCatalina charms the Archbishop of Zaragoza into giving her a blessing and a small golden cross. Teresa, just two, toddles through the episcopal palace leaving chaos and enchantment in her wake. Even Bianca, quiet and watchful at nearly three, earns smiles for her solemn gravity.\n\nLucia moves through it all with effortless grace, her Italian sophistication perfectly modulated to Spanish sensibilities. She speaks with the Aragonese ladies about children and household management, never once mentioning politics—and in doing so, accomplishes more diplomacy than a dozen formal negotiations.\n\nWord rides ahead to Barcelona. Messengers carry reports to Alfonso: The King of Castile approaches with his queen and five children. The heir rides like a knight. The eldest princess sings like an angel. The dynasty flourishes.\n\nThe Descent to the Sea\n\nThe final stretch of road winds down from the Aragonese highlands toward the Mediterranean. The air changes—salt and warmth replacing the dry wind of the meseta. The children crowd the carriage windows to catch their first glimpse of the sea.\n\nFernando sees it first. \"Father,\" he calls from his palfrey, pointing east. \"Is that—?\"\n\nThe Mediterranean stretches to the horizon, hammered silver under the spring sun. You remember your own first sight of it, years ago. Now you watch your son discover it, his serious face breaking into rare wonder.\n\n\"That is the sea, Fernando. And beyond it—Constantinople, where your father earned his title. Rome, where the Holy Father dwells. Naples, where your uncle now makes war. The whole of Christendom, and the lands beyond.\"\n\nHe absorbs this in silence. Then: \"Will I see Constantinople someday?\"\n\n\"God willing.\"\n\nBarcelona — April 1437\n\nYou enter Barcelona in the second week of April, the royal column winding through streets lined with citizens who have heard the stories filtering down from Zaragoza and Guadalajara. The Castilian king with his beautiful Italian queen. The little princess who sings. The heir who rides like a born knight.\n\nAlfonso V has sent an honor guard to meet you at the city gates—Aragonese knights in the red and gold bars of their kingdom, their captain bearing formal greetings from the king. Alfonso himself waits at the Palau Reial Major, the ancient seat of the Counts of Barcelona.\n\nThe captain's eyes move over your family as he delivers his prepared words. You see him counting: five children, all healthy, the queen already recovered from her latest birth. He sees what Alfonso will see—a dynasty ascendant, a line secured, a future written in the faces of the children who watch him with varying degrees of curiosity and imperial disdain.\n\nThe message has been delivered before you speak a single word to your brother-in-law.\n\nThe Palau Reial Major rises ahead, its medieval towers sharp against the spring sky. Somewhere within, Alfonso V of Aragon—conqueror, schemer, the man whose kingdoms you will inherit and whose death you carry on your finger—waits to receive his family.",

      "text": "The Palau Reial Major\n\nThe ancient palace rises from the heart of Barcelona's Gothic quarter, its stones darkened by centuries of sea air and Mediterranean sun. You pass through the Plaça del Rei—the King's Square—where Aragonese banners snap in the spring breeze alongside the arms of Castile, hung in honor of your arrival.\n\nThe great doors stand open. Inside, the Saló del Tinell awaits—the vast throne room where the Counts of Barcelona held court for generations, its rounded arches soaring overhead like the ribs of some great stone beast.\n\nAlfonso V stands at the far end.\n\nHe has aged since you last saw him. The Italian campaigns have carved new lines into his face, and there is grey now at his temples that was not there before. But the energy remains—that restless vitality that drove him across the Mediterranean to chase a crown. He wears cloth-of-gold over crimson, the arms of Aragon quartered with those of Sicily and Naples, a statement of ambition stitched in silk.\n\nBeside him stands your sister María, Queen of Aragon. She is thirty-six now, her beauty settling into the handsome severity of middle age. Her eyes find you as you enter, and something flickers there—relief, perhaps, or longing, or the complicated weight of a sister who has not seen her brother in years.\n\nThe court of Aragon fills the hall: nobles, clergy, officials, all watching the King of Castile approach with his family arrayed behind him. Lucia walks at your side, Juana in her arms. The nurses carry Bianca and Teresa. Fernando walks on his own, small but straight-backed, his eyes fixed forward. Catalina holds her brother's hand, for once subdued by the grandeur around her.\n\nAlfonso descends the steps from the dais. His stride is confident, proprietary—a king in his own hall, receiving a guest he considers an equal but perhaps not quite a rival. Not yet.\n\nHe stops before you. The hall falls silent.\n\n\"Brother.\" Alfonso's voice carries easily in the vaulted space, pitched for the audience as much as for you. His arms open, and he embraces you—the formal embrace of kings, cheek to cheek, hands gripping shoulders. You smell wine on his breath, faint but present. This close, you can see the yellowing at the corners of his eyes, the slight tremor in his hands that he hides well but cannot entirely conceal.\n\nHe pulls back, holding you at arm's length, studying your face.\n\n\"You look well. Kingly, even. The years have been generous.\" A smile, charming and calculated. \"And this—\" his gaze moves past you to Lucia, to the children, \"—this is the dynasty I have heard so much about.\"\n\nHe releases you and turns to your wife, taking her free hand and bowing over it with courtly grace.\n\n\"Queen Lucia. Italy's loss remains Castile's gain. You are as beautiful as the poets claim.\" He straightens, glancing at the infant in her arms. \"And this would be the newest addition? Juana, yes? Named for her father, I am told.\" A flicker of amusement. \"Vanity becomes you, brother.\"\n\nThen his attention shifts to the children. He crouches—slowly, you notice, with a slight stiffness in his knees—to bring himself to Fernando's level.\n\n\"And you must be Fernando. Prince of Asturias. Heir to Castile.\" Alfonso studies your son with open appraisal. \"They tell me you ride already. That you sit a horse like a man grown.\"\n\nFernando meets the King of Aragon's gaze without flinching.\n\nAlfonso's smile widens. He straightens and looks to Catalina, who watches him with those calculating dark eyes.\n\n\"And the famous Catalina. The one who sings.\" He tilts his head. \"Will you sing for your uncle, little one, before your visit ends?\"\n\nMaría has not moved from the dais. She watches the scene below, hands folded, face composed. But her eyes keep returning to you—to the brother she has not seen in years, who has become something more than the young king she remembers.\n\nAlfonso turns back to you, spreading his hands to encompass the hall, the palace, the city beyond.\n\n\"Welcome to Barcelona, brother. We have much to discuss—Naples, the Turk, the future of Christendom.\" His smile sharpens, just slightly. \"But first, let us be family. There will be time enough for politics.\"\n\nHe gestures toward the dais, toward María, toward the seats prepared for you beside the Aragonese throne.\n\n\"Come. My queen has waited long enough to embrace her brother.\"",

      "text": "The formal reception dissolves into something warmer as the evening unfolds.\n\nThe great hall gives way to a smaller dining chamber—still grand by any measure, but intimate enough for family. Tapestries depicting the conquest of Mallorca line the walls, Aragonese history woven in silk and gold thread. Candles soften the spring twilight filtering through tall windows that overlook the sea.\n\nMaría comes alive among the children in a way she never did on the dais. She kneels on the floor in her queen's gown, heedless of the silk, building block towers with Teresa while Bianca watches with solemn approval. When Fernando approaches to show her a small wooden knight he has carried from Toledo, she examines it with genuine interest, asking him about his horse, his studies, his favorite books. Her questions are careful, hungry—the questions of a woman who has no children of her own and feels that absence keenly.\n\n\"He has your eyes,\" she tells Lucia quietly, watching Fernando return to his seat. \"But his manner is... gentler. Thoughtful.\" She glances at you, something unreadable in her expression. \"You were never so still at his age, brother. You were always climbing things. Escaping your tutors.\"\n\nCatalina, predictably, gravitates toward Alfonso. The King of Aragon seems genuinely charmed by her—or perhaps recognizes a kindred spirit. They conduct a negotiation over honeyed almonds that ends with Catalina in possession of the entire bowl and Alfonso laughing in a way that seems, for a moment, unguarded.\n\n\"This one will be trouble,\" he announces to the table. \"Mark my words. She will have kings fighting over her hand before she is twelve.\"\n\nHe drinks steadily through dinner—good Aragonese wine, cup after cup, refilled by attentive servants. You notice how his hand trembles slightly when he reaches for the pitcher himself, how he shifts in his seat as though unable to find comfort. The yellowing in his eyes is more pronounced in candlelight. When he laughs, there is sometimes a catch in his breath, a pause that suggests pain suppressed.\n\nBut his mind remains sharp. Between courses, between the children's interruptions and María's quiet questions, Alfonso speaks of Naples—the endless siege, the Angevin resistance, the Pope's wavering support. He speaks of the Ottoman advance, of Constantinople's desperate embassies, of the failures of Christendom to mount any coherent response.\n\n\"Except you, of course.\" He raises his cup toward you, an ironic salute. \"The Defensor Romaniae. The man who actually went.\" There is something in his voice—admiration, perhaps, or envy, or the wariness of a king who recognizes a rival's rising star. \"Tell me, brother. Was it worth it? The knights, the gold, the months away from your kingdom? For a city that will fall anyway, sooner or later?\"\n\nThe table falls quiet. María's hand pauses on Teresa's hair. Lucia's eyes meet yours for a moment.\n\nAlfonso waits, cup raised, watching you over its rim.",

The question is how much of this Juan notices and can assess during the dinner.\n\nI should create a table that reflects Juan's perception - ranging from \"Alfonso conceals his ailments well, appears robust\" to \"Alfonso's decline is obvious and alarming.\"\n\nOBSERVATION ROLL: Alfonso V's Apparent Health\n\nWhat Juan perceives during the dinner — his best assessment based on visible signs.\n\nRoll\nJuan's Assessment\n1-10\nConcealed well. Alfonso's charm and energy dominate Juan's impression. The tremor could be fatigue from campaign; the drinking merely Aragonese hospitality. Juan notices nothing that would suggest serious decline. If anything, Alfonso seems vital, dangerous, a king in his prime.\n11-25\nMinor concerns. Juan notices the yellowed eyes, the steady drinking, the occasional stiffness. But these could be the normal wear of a campaigning king approaching fifty. Nothing alarming. Alfonso might have another fifteen years in him, perhaps more.\n26-40\nAccumulating damage. The signs are there for anyone paying attention: the tremor, the labored breath, the way Alfonso shifts against pain he thinks he's hiding. A body worn by war and excess. Juan estimates perhaps a decade remains, possibly less if the drinking continues.\n41-60\nVisible decline. Alfonso is unwell, and it shows. The yellowing speaks to liver damage; the tremor suggests nerves or organs failing; the breathlessness hints at a heart under strain. Juan recognizes a man whose body is failing him faster than his mind. Five to eight years, perhaps, without intervention.\n61-75\nPronounced deterioration. Juan sees what Alfonso's court has likely learned to ignore: a king whose flesh is betraying him. The campaign in Naples is killing him as surely as any Angevin blade. The drinking accelerates what war began. Without significant change, Alfonso may not see 1445.\n76-90\nAlarming signs. Alfonso's decline is stark to Juan's eyes. Moments of confusion or fatigue that Alfonso covers with bluster. Pain that breaks through his composure. The body of a man twenty years older than his age. Juan realizes the succession question may arise sooner than anyone expects—perhaps within five years.\n91-100\nUnmistakable collapse. Juan sees a dying man. Alfonso's energy is the feverish vitality of a body burning through its final reserves. The yellowing, the tremor, the breathlessness, the pain—these are not the marks of a king who will reign long. Three years, perhaps four. The poison may prove unnecessary; nature is already doing the work.\n\nRoll when ready.",

Juan realizes the succession question may arise sooner than expected - perhaps within five years.\n\nI should narrate what Juan observes during the dinner, showing these alarming signs through concrete details. I need to be careful not to generate any dialogue or actions for Juan - I should describe what he sees and perceives, then stop when Alfonso asks him a direct question (which he already has - about Constantinople being worth it).\n\nActually, looking back at the conversation, Alfonso already asked Juan a question: \"Tell me, brother. Was it worth it? The knights, the gold, the months away from your kingdom? For a city that will fall anyway, sooner or later?\"\n\nThe user then asked for the health observation roll instead of responding. Now I've provided the roll result, I should narrate Juan's observations of Alfonso's health based on the 83 result, and then return to the scene where Alfonso is waiting for Juan's answer.\n\nRoll: 83 — Alarming Signs\n\nYou watch Alfonso across the table, and you see what his court has learned not to see.\n\nIt is in the small things, the moments between performance. When Alfonso reaches for his cup, the tremor is not merely unsteady—it is the shake of muscles that no longer fully obey. When he laughs at Catalina's negotiation over almonds, the laughter catches, hitches, and for a heartbeat his hand presses against his side before he masters himself. His servants refill his wine without being asked because they have learned the rhythm of his need—not the indulgence of a man who enjoys drink, but the medicine of a man who requires it to function.\n\nThe yellowing in his eyes is jaundice. You have seen it before, in men whose livers failed them. The stiffness when he crouched to greet Fernando was not merely age—it was pain, joint-deep, the kind that never fully recedes. When he thinks no one is watching, his face slackens into exhaustion that borders on collapse.\n\nAnd there—twice during dinner—his words slur for just a moment. Not drunkenness, or not only drunkenness. Something else. A mind flickering like a candle in a draft, catching itself, recovering, pressing on through sheer Aragonese stubbornness.\n\nAlfonso is fifty-one years old. The man across from you looks sixty-five.\n\nThe Naples campaign is killing him. The Italian fevers, the sieges, the years of sleeping in tents and eating camp food while his body screamed for rest. The drinking that dulls the pain but poisons the organs. The old wounds that never healed properly, that ache when the weather changes and suppurate when stressed.\n\nYou think of the ring on your finger. The poison that accumulates in liver and kidneys.\n\nAlfonso's liver is already failing. His kidneys likely strain under the burden of processing the wine he drinks to manage everything else. Isaac's compound will find fertile ground—a body already compromised, already dying by degrees. One drop tonight would simply... accelerate what nature has begun.\n\nFive years. Perhaps less. The succession question will arise sooner than anyone in this room expects—except, perhaps, for María, whose eyes carry the particular grief of a wife watching her husband die by inches while the court pretends not to notice.\n\nAlfonso raises his cup, watching you, waiting for your answer about Constantinople.\n\n\"Was it worth it, brother?\"",

But Juan's directness - asking \"how are you\" after that observation roll of 83 - might catch him slightly off guard.\n\nMaría is also present and she knows her husband is unwell. This is a family dinner, somewhat intimate.\n\nI should have Alfonso respond in character - probably deflecting somewhat, maybe with bravado about Naples, but perhaps a moment where the mask slips slightly. The question \"How are you?\" is pointed enough that it might land differently than Alfonso expects.\n\nI need to stop after Alfonso speaks and wait for Juan's response.\n\nAlfonso's expression flickers—Loss for just a moment, something vulnerable and surprised, as though your words struck a chord he did not expect. Betting everything. Die trying. Made my peace.\n\nThen the mask returns, and he laughs. But the laugh is hollow, and both of you know it.\n\n\"The war is not won, brother.

Actually, they might also be cousins through some other connection given the intermarried nature of Iberian royalty. But the more immediate relationship is brother-in-law. I should probably have Alfonso note this or just go with it naturally.\n\nLet me also note that the user said \"We assume Alfonso dies this year of natural causes\" - meaning they want to establish that Alfonso will die in 1437 from his declining health, making the poisoning somewhat unnecessary in the end (though Juan doesn't know this yet).\n\nI need to:\n1. Correct the narrative - Alfonso has won Naples, is King of Naples\n2. Have Alfonso respond to Juan's question about how he feels\n3. Not have Lucia be pregnant\n4. Continue the intimate family dinner conversation\n\nAlso I should note - Alfonso would likely say \"brother\" not respond to \"cousin\" since they're brothers-in-law and that's a closer relationship term.\n\nAlfonso blinks, and for a moment the King of Aragon seems genuinely uncertain how to respond. The question is too simple, too direct. Kings do not ask each other how they feel.\n\n\"Brother,\" he corrects gently, though without rancor. \"We are brothers, you and I. By marriage if not by blood.\"\n\nHe looks down at his hands—the tremor visible now that he is not holding a cup to steady them. María watches from across the table, her expression carefully neutral, but you see the tightness around her eyes.\n\n\"The strain.\" Alfonso repeats the word as though tasting it. \"Yes. I suppose it has.\"\n\nHe is quiet for a long moment. In the silence, Teresa babbles something to María, and Catalina whispers to Fernando, and the servants move soundlessly along the edges of the room. The sounds of family, of life continuing around a conversation that has grown unexpectedly heavy.\n\n\"Naples is mine. I am king in Naples, king in Sicily, king in Aragon. Everything I fought for, everything I bled for—I have it.\" Alfonso's voice is distant, reciting facts rather than celebrating victories. \"Giovanna is dead. René has fled. The Pope has reconciled himself to reality. I sit on the throne of the Regno, master of the western Mediterranean.\"\n\nHe looks up, and his eyes are those of a man who has climbed a mountain only to find the summit empty.\n\n\"And I am so tired, Juan. Tired in my bones. Tired in my soul.\" A breath that catches slightly. \"I thought winning would feel like... something. Victory. Triumph. Instead I wake each morning and think—is this all? Is this what I spent twenty years pursuing?\"\n\nMaría rises quietly, murmurs something about putting Teresa to bed, gathers the younger children with the help of the nurses. She touches Alfonso's shoulder as she passes—a brief pressure, there and gone. He does not acknowledge it, but his hand moves toward hers a moment too late.\n\nWhen the women and children have gone, only you, Alfonso, and a few servants remain. The King of Aragon reaches for his wine at last.\n\n\"You asked how I feel.\" He drinks. \"I feel old, brother. I feel like a man who has won everything and cannot remember why he wanted it.\"\n\nHis eyes find yours, and there is something raw there—the honesty of a man too exhausted for pretense.\n\n\"How do you do it?

You speak with Alfonso of the Ottoman threat, of coordinated naval strategy, of the crusade that must come. He agrees to everything in principle, commits to nothing in particular.

King of Aragon, Sicily, and Naples...\" The messenger swallows. \"His Majesty is dead. He passed three days ago, in his sleep. The physicians say his heart gave out.\"\n\nThe study falls silent.

Aragon proper - The Aragonese nobility may have their own preferences. There might be other claimants. The Cortes of Aragon would need to approve any succession.\n\n2. Naples - This is even more complicated. Naples was a personal conquest of Alfonso's. René of Anjou still has claims. The Pope has influence. The Italian powers (Venice, Milan, Florence, the Papacy) would all have opinions.\n\n3. Sicily - Another separate consideration.\n\nÁlvaro should be cautious and realistic - pressing claims is one thing, actually securing crowns is another. There are legal, military, and political dimensions.\n\nLet me craft Álvaro's response with appropriate complexity and caution.\n\nÁlvaro's expression shifts rapidly—grief suppressed, calculation engaged, the administrator displacing the man. He sets down his document and moves to the map of Iberia and the Mediterranean that hangs on the study wall.\n\n\"Your Majesty, the situation is... complex.\" He traces the coastline from Barcelona to Naples with one finger. \"Aragon and Naples are separate inheritances with separate laws.

A show of strength, of legitimacy—\"\n\n\"Naples is the greater problem,\" Álvaro interrupts, his voice tight. \"Alfonso won that crown by conquest, not inheritance. The moment he dies, every vulture in Italy circles. René of Anjou will press his claim again. The Pope—whoever sits in Peter's chair—will have opinions. Venice, Milan, Florence... they will not welcome a Spanish king ruling both Aragon and Naples.

A fourth child, due in late autumn or early winter. You had known, of course. You had watched her body change through the summer months, the familiar rhythm of your marriage continuing even as the world shifted around you.\n\nShe absorbs the news of Alfonso's death with the composure you have come to expect from her. No gasp, no tears. Only that slight tightening around her eyes, the quick calculation behind the grey-green.\n\n\"Dead,\" she repeats quietly. \"Then you are King of Aragon. King of Naples.\" She looks at you—truly looks, seeing past the crown to the man beneath. \"King of half the Mediterranean, if you can hold it.\"\n\nHer hand remains on her belly. Juana fusses against her hip, sensing the tension in her mother's body.\n\n\"I cannot come with you.\" It is not a complaint, merely a fact. \"Not like this. The roads to Zaragoza, the weeks of negotiation, the ceremonies...\" She shakes her head. \"The child would come in some Aragonese castle surrounded by strangers.

Something entirely his own.\n\n\"You will miss the birth,\" Lucia says. Her voice is steady, but something flickers beneath it. \"Again. As you missed Bianca's, in Naples.\"\n\nShe steps closer, her free hand finding yours.\n\n\"How am I, you ask?\" A breath, measured. \"I am tired, husband. I am heavy with your child.

      "text": "Juan wants to gather his children and explain what has happened - Alfonso's death and why he must leave for Aragon. Let me think about which children can understand:\n\n- Catalina: Nearly 6 years old (born January 28, 1432) - definitely can understand\n- Fernando: 4 years old (born August 3, 1433) - can understand at a basic level\n- Bianca: 3 years old (born September 14, 1434) - probably too young for a real conversation\n- Teresa: ~2 years old (born late 1435) - too young\n- Juana: ~10 months old (born November/December 1436) - infant, too young\n\nSo realistically, Catalina and Fernando are the ones who can understand. Maybe Bianca can be present but won't really grasp it.\n\nI should set the scene and have the children respond in character - Catalina with her precocious intelligence and Fernando with his serious, thoughtful nature. Then STOP and wait for Juan to actually speak to them, as per the rules. I must not generate Juan's dialogue or actions beyond what the player has stated.\n\nActually, the player said \"I gather all my children who can understand and explain what has happened\" - so Juan IS going to explain. But I still shouldn't write Juan's actual words. I should set up the scene with the children gathered, ready to listen, and then STOP before Juan speaks. Or I could describe the aftermath of Juan explaining, showing how the children react.\n\nLet me re-read the instruction: \"I gather all my children who can understand and explain what has happened and why I have to leave.\"\n\nThis is Juan stating his action - he gathers them and explains. I should narrate the scene and the children's reactions to what Juan tells them, without writing Juan's specific words. I can show the children listening, reacting, asking questions.\n\nLet me write this carefully - setting the scene, showing the children's reactions as Juan explains (without quoting Juan), and then having them respond with questions or statements that give Juan opportunity to respond.\n\nThe nurses take Juana, Teresa, and Bianca—too young to understand, too young to carry this weight. You are left with Fernando and Catalina in the fading light of the nursery.\n\nFernando stands straight, hands at his sides, watching you with those serious eyes. Four years old, but something older lives behind that gaze. He knows this moment matters. He has positioned himself the way he has seen knights stand when receiving orders.\n\nCatalina settles onto a cushioned stool, smoothing her skirts with unconscious grace. At nearly six, she has already learned to compose herself for important conversations. Her dark eyes—Isabel's eyes, you think with a familiar pang—are fixed on your face, missing nothing.\n\nLucia withdraws to the window seat, giving you space but remaining present. Her hand rests on her belly. She watches the children watch you.\n\nYou tell them.\n\nYou tell them that their Uncle Alfonso, King of Aragon, has died. That he was a great king who fought many battles and won a kingdom across the sea. That he had no children of his own, and so his crown passes to you—their father. That you must travel to Zaragoza, to the Aragonese court, to receive this crown and become king of another realm.\n\nThat you do not know how long you will be gone.\n\nFernando absorbs this in silence, processing. His brow furrows—not with grief, for he barely knew Alfonso, but with the effort of understanding.\n\n\"Father,\" he says finally, his voice careful. \"If you are King of Aragon now... am I still Prince of Asturias? Or am I something else?\"\n\nCatalina's response is different. Her chin lifts, and something flickers across her face—excitement, perhaps, or ambition, or simply the thrill of change.\n\n\"Will we live in Barcelona now? Will I be a princess of two kingdoms?\"",

He glances toward Lucia, toward the swell of her belly, and you see the connection form behind his eyes. He is four years old and already calculating risks.\n\nCatalina, meanwhile, has seized upon a different thread entirely.\n\n\"Aunt María is coming to live with us?\" Her eyes brighten. \"She was kind. She let me hold her pearls. And she cried when I sang for her.\" A pause, something more calculating surfacing. \"Will she teach me Catalan? I want to learn before we go to Barcelona again.

For once, she does not compete for attention, does not try to insert herself into the moment. She simply observes, dark eyes moving between Fernando and you, cataloguing something for later consideration.\n\nThen she rises, crosses to her brother, and takes his hand.\n\n\"I will help,\" she announces. \"Fernando can look after them and I will help.

No carriages, no baggage train, no ceremonial trappings—just mounted men moving fast along roads you have traveled before.\n\nWord flies ahead of you. It always does.\n\nGuadalajara\n\nDon Íñigo López de Mendoza meets you at the city gates, still pulling on his riding gloves. He has barely had time to receive word of Alfonso's death, let alone your approach, but the patriarch of the Mendoza is not a man to be caught unprepared.\n\n\"Your Majesty.\" He falls in beside you without slowing your pace. \"I ride with you to Zaragoza. My men will follow.\"\n\nIt is not a request. It is a statement of allegiance—the most powerful house in Castile declaring itself before anyone else can. By the time you clear Guadalajara's eastern gate, thirty Mendoza knights have joined your column.\n\nCalatayud\n\nThe first Aragonese city opens its gates without hesitation. The alcalde kneels in the plaza, offering bread and salt in the ancient tradition. His hands tremble—not from fear, but from the weight of the moment. He knows he is the first Aragonese official to acknowledge the new order.\n\n\"Your Majesty, King of Aragon,\" he says, and the words echo off the stone walls.\n\nBehind him, the townspeople watch in silence. You see no hostility in their faces—only the wary calculation of people who have learned that kings come and go, but taxes remain. They are waiting to see what manner of ruler you will be.\n\nZaragoza\n\nThe capital of Aragon receives you with full ceremony. The Archbishop himself rides out to meet you, flanked by the justicia—that peculiar Aragonese office that stands between king and law—and a delegation of nobles whose faces betray careful neutrality.\n\nThey have had time to prepare. Time to discuss among themselves. Time to decide what conditions they will demand.\n\nBut they have not had time to organize resistance. Your speed has caught them between mourning and maneuvering. Alfonso's body has barely cooled, and here stands his heir, vital and present, with Castilian knights at his back and Aragonese lords already falling in behind him.\n\nYou do not linger. You pay your respects, accept their formal welcome, promise to return for the coronation. Then you press on.\n\nBarcelona. María.

Your horses are exhausted, your guard hollow-eyed from hard riding, but you arrive upright, composed, every inch a king.\n\nThe Palau Reial Major is draped in black. Alfonso's banners fly at half-mast. The court is still in formal mourning, the hallways hushed, the servants moving in whispers.\n\nMaría receives you in the same chamber where you dined with Alfonso five months ago. She wears widow's black, her face pale and drawn. She has aged a decade in the months since you saw her last. But when you enter, something in her expression eases—relief, perhaps, or simply the comfort of family in a court full of strangers.\n\n\"Juan.\" She rises, abandons protocol, embraces you as a sister rather than a queen greeting a king. Her shoulders shake once, then still. When she pulls back, her composure has reassembled itself.\n\n\"You came quickly. Faster than anyone expected.\" She glances at the doorway, at the Aragonese officials hovering just out of earshot. \"There are already factions forming. Men who think a Castilian king means Aragonese subjugation. Men who whisper of alternatives.\"\n\nShe presses something into your hand—a folded letter, sealed in red wax.\n\n\"This came yesterday. From Naples. From the lords who held Alfonso's Italian kingdom.\" Her voice drops. \"They do not recognize your claim. They speak of René of Anjou.\"\n\nShe looks up at you, the weight of widowhood and politics heavy on her shoulders.\n\n\"What will you do, brother?\"",

The Aragonese Cortes acknowledged this years ago\n3. The Infantes Juan and Enrique are dead\n4. Young Carlos of Viana is dead (no rival claimants from that line)\n5. Juan is among the strongest claimants through his mother (sister of Ferdinand of Antequera)\n6. Juan arrived very quickly (roll of 90 - triumphant arrival)\n7. María (Alfonso's widow, Juan's sister) supports him\n8. The Mendoza have already declared support\n9. Juan has a proven track record - conquered Granada, defended Constantinople, defeated René of Anjou\n10. Juan demonstrated respect for Catalan identity (learned some Catalan, sent silk to María)\n11. Alfonso named Juan as his heir and even swore to serve as regent if Juan dies\n12. Juan has multiple healthy heirs (succession is secure)\n\n**FAILURE FACTORS:**\n1. Aragon is fiercely independent - they fear absorption into Castile\n2. The Aragonese Cortes holds great power and will demand concessions (fueros)\n3. Some factions prefer Aragonese independence over union with Castile\n4. There may be distant claimants who could be put forward as alternatives\n5. The Cortes will want to extract maximum concessions before acceptance\n6. Some may whisper of Juan's growing power being too dangerous\n7. Barcelona/Catalan identity vs. Castilian overlordship concerns\n\nLet me draft a table that reflects these factors. Given the strong success factors (legitimate heir, no strong rivals, fast arrival, sister's support), this should lean positive but still have room for complications since the Aragonese Cortes is famously demanding.\n\nBased on my research, here are the key factors:\n\nSUCCESS FACTORS:\n\nJuan is the legitimate, acknowledged heir by treaty and Alfonso's own declaration\n\nThe Aragonese Cortes previously acknowledged Juan's succession rights\n\nAll rival claimants eliminated: Infantes Juan and Enrique dead, Carlos of Viana dead\n\nJuan's mother was sister to Ferdinand of Antequera (strong blood claim)\n\nTriumphant arrival (roll 90) — impressed Aragonese before negotiations began\n\nMaría (Alfonso's widow, Juan's sister) supports Juan\n\nMendoza already declared support publicly\n\nJuan's proven record: Granada, Constantinople, Naples victory for Alfonso\n\nJuan showed respect for Catalan culture (learned some Catalan, gifts to María)\n\nAlfonso himself swore oaths binding the houses together\n\nJuan has multiple healthy heirs — succession is secure\n\nFAILURE FACTORS:\n\nAragonese fiercely protective of independence and fueros\n\nFear of absorption into Castile — loss of separate identity\n\nCortes holds substantial power and will demand concessions\n\nSome factions may prefer a weaker, more malleable candidate\n\nJuan's growing power makes some nervous — too successful, too ambitious\n\nARAGON SUCCESSION ROLL — September 1437\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-5\nRejection. Despite Juan's legitimacy, a faction produces a distant claimant and the Cortes fractures. Civil conflict looms. Juan must choose between withdrawal or force.\n6-15\nHostile resistance. The Cortes acknowledges Juan's claim but demands impossible concessions — Aragonese-born heirs, permanent residence in Barcelona, separate administration with no Castilian involvement. Negotiations stall indefinitely.\n16-25\nGrudging delay. The Cortes refuses to act hastily. They insist on months of deliberation, investigation of Juan's \"true intentions,\" and extensive negotiation. The crown remains in limbo while factions maneuver.\n26-40\nHard bargaining. The Cortes accepts Juan's claim in principle but extracts maximum concessions: iron-clad guarantees of Aragonese laws, separate councils, promises that Fernando will spend years in Aragon. Acceptance comes at a price.\n41-55\nConditional acceptance. The Cortes acknowledges Juan as king but with significant conditions attached — preservation of fueros, regular presence in Aragonese lands, appointment of Aragonese officials to key positions. Standard terms for a personal union.\n56-70\nSmooth transition. Juan's legitimacy, swift arrival, and María's support carry the day. The Cortes accepts him with normal conditions. The union proceeds without serious opposition.\n71-85\nWarm reception. The Aragonese nobility, impressed by Juan's reputation and respectful approach, welcomes the union. Conditions are reasonable; some nobles actively support stronger ties with Castile.\n86-95\nEnthusiastic acceptance. Juan's victories, his treatment of Alfonso, and his respect for Catalan culture have won hearts. The Cortes accepts him with minimal conditions. Many see the union as Aragon's elevation, not subjugation.\n96-100\nTriumphant union. The Aragonese embrace Juan as a hero-king. His conquest of Granada, defense of Constantinople, and support for Alfonso in Naples have made him a legend. The Cortes not only accepts but celebrates the union, seeing it as the dawn of a new era for all Iberia.\n\nRoll when ready.",

This negotiation will determine the terms of the union.\n\nNow for Naples. The situation is fundamentally different:\n\nNAPLES FACTORS:\n\nSuccess Factors:\n\nJuan directly helped Alfonso win Naples at Aversa\n\nAlfonso swore sacred oaths binding the houses together\n\nJuan's military reputation is formidable\n\nSome Neapolitan lords prefer continuity over renewed civil war\n\nRené of Anjou was decisively defeated and renounced his claim\n\nFailure Factors:\n\nNaples was won by Alfonso's conquest, not clear inheritance\n\nNaples is a papal fief — the Pope must approve any succession\n\nItalian states (Venice, Milan, Florence) fear Iberian dominance\n\nRené of Anjou has French backing and may renew his claim despite renunciation\n\nNeapolitan nobility may prefer a weaker, more local ruler\n\nJuan already holds Castile and now Aragon — too much power for Italian comfort\n\nJuan cannot possibly govern Naples from Toledo — absentee rule breeds resentment\n\nFrench intervention is almost certain\n\nNAPLES SUCCESSION ROLL — Autumn 1437\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-10\nComplete rejection. The Neapolitan lords declare Alfonso's conquest personal, not heritable. They invite René of Anjou to return, or elevate a local candidate. Juan's claim is dismissed outright. War is inevitable if he wishes to press it.\n11-20\nFrench intervention. Before Juan can even press his claim, René of Anjou lands with French troops. The Neapolitan nobility splits — some support Juan, others the Angevin. Naples descends into civil war.\n21-30\nPapal opposition. Pope Eugenius IV (or his successor) refuses to invest Juan with the Kingdom of Naples, citing concerns about Iberian hegemony. Without papal approval, Juan's claim lacks legitimacy. The situation remains unresolved.\n31-40\nHostile nobility. The Neapolitan barons technically acknowledge Juan's claim but refuse cooperation. They demand an independent viceroy of their choosing, control of taxation, and effective autonomy. Naples in name only.\n41-50\nFragile acceptance. Naples accepts Juan under duress, but loyalty is shallow. The nobility waits for French intervention or papal reversal. Juan holds the crown but not the kingdom.\n51-60\nConditional recognition. The Neapolitan lords accept Juan if he appoints an Aragonese or Italian viceroy, maintains Alfonso's administration, and promises regular presence or that of his heir. A workable arrangement, but requiring constant attention.\n61-70\nNegotiated settlement. Naples accepts Juan's succession with reasonable terms — existing privileges confirmed, competent viceroy appointed, no excessive taxation. The transition proceeds, though vigilance is required.\n71-80\nSmooth succession. Alfonso's administration transfers loyalty to Juan. The barons who fought beside Castilian knights at Aversa remember who won them their victory. Naples accepts the new king with minimal friction.\n81-90\nWarm reception. Juan's role in defeating René is remembered with gratitude. The Neapolitan lords see advantage in connection to the rising Iberian power. They accept Juan enthusiastically, hoping for protection and prosperity.\n91-100\nTriumphant inheritance. Naples welcomes Juan as liberator and rightful heir. Alfonso's dying wish (if he expressed one) and Juan's proven valor unite the kingdom behind him. Even potential French intervention seems unlikely to shake Neapolitan loyalty.\n\nRoll when ready.",

Ink blots mark where a small hand pressed too hard. Here and there, words are crossed out and rewritten.\n\nMaría's lips move as she reads. You cannot see the words from where you stand, but you know what Catalina wrote—or approximately what she wrote, given that you did not read it before sealing it for her. Something about welcome. Something about pearls. Something about wanting to learn Catalan so she can speak to her aunt properly.\n\nMaría's composure—the queenly mask she has worn through Alfonso's decline, through his death, through the vultures circling her husband's still-warm throne—cracks.\n\nA sound escapes her. Not quite a sob. Something rawer. She presses the letter to her chest and turns away, her shoulders shaking.

She does not try to hide it.\n\n\"She remembers me.\" Her voice breaks. \"She remembers that I let her hold my pearls. That was—that was one afternoon, Juan. One afternoon, and she remembered.\"\n\nShe looks down at the letter again, touching the clumsy letters with her fingertips as though they were holy script.\n\n\"I have no children. Twelve years of marriage, and God gave us no children.

I am the Queen of Nothing. I am—\"\n\nShe stops herself. Breathes. The mask reassembles, imperfectly.\n\n\"Catalina writes that I should come live with you.

      "text": "Juan is inviting María to come live with him in Toledo, to be part of his family, to teach his children Catalan. This is a genuine offer of family connection after María has lost everything - her husband, her hopes of children, her position.\n\nMaría is 36-40 years old, a barren widow, and her situation is precarious. In medieval terms, a childless queen widow often faced a difficult future - sent back to her family, pushed into a convent, or marginalized at court. Juan is offering her something precious: a place, a purpose, a family.\n\nI should write María's emotional response to this offer. She's been holding herself together through Alfonso's decline and death, through the political vultures circling, and now her brother is offering her genuine love and a home.\n\nI need to stop after María speaks so Juan can respond. I shouldn't generate Juan's dialogue or actions.\n\nMaría stares at you for a long moment. The letter trembles in her hands.\n\n\"You mean it.\" It is not a question. She knows you well enough—remembers the boy you were before you became the king you are—to recognize sincerity. \"You actually mean it.\"\n\nShe sets the letter down carefully on a side table, smoothing it flat with her palm, treating it like something precious. When she looks up again, there is something new in her expression. Not hope, exactly. Something more fragile than hope. The first green shoot after a long winter.\n\n\"I have been Queen of Aragon for twenty years, Juan. I ruled as regent while Alfonso chased his Italian dreams. I held this kingdom together through rebellions and plagues and wars. And now—\" She gestures at the black-draped room, at the palace that is no longer hers. \"Now I am the dowager. The obligation. The problem to be solved.\"\n\nShe moves to the window, looking out over Barcelona—the city she has governed, the harbor where Alfonso's ships came and went, the cathedral spires rising against the autumn sky.\n\n\"The Cortes will want me gone. A reminder of the old reign, a potential rallying point for malcontents. They will offer me a convent, or a small estate somewhere I cannot cause trouble.\" Her voice is bitter. \"They have already begun to discuss it. They think I do not hear, but I hear everything in this palace.\"\n\nShe turns back to you.\n\n\"Toledo.\" She tastes the word. \"Your children. Catalina, who remembers my pearls. Fernando, whom I have never properly met. The little ones—Bianca, Teresa, Juana.\" A pause. \"And another coming, if Lucia's letters spoke true.\"\n\nMaría crosses the room to stand before you. She is shorter than you remember—or perhaps you have simply grown into your kingship while she has shrunk into her widowhood. But her eyes, when they meet yours, are still the eyes of the sister who defended you against tutors, who snuck you honeycakes from the kitchen, who wept when you were crowned and she was sent away to Aragon.\n\n\"I would like that, Juan.\" Her voice is barely above a whisper. \"I would like to teach your children Catalan. I would like to be an aunt instead of a dowager. I would like to be family again, not just a piece on someone's political board.\"\n\nShe reaches out and takes your hands in hers.\n\n\"But first—\" Her grip tightens, and something of the regent, the politician, the woman who held Aragon together for two decades, surfaces in her gaze. \"First you must survive the Cortes. They will try to pick you apart, brother. They will demand concessions that would make you king in name only. They respect strength, not sentiment.\"\n\nShe releases your hands and steps back, composing herself.\n\n\"Tell me what you need from me. I know every faction, every grudge, every secret alliance in that chamber. I know who can be bought, who can be flattered, who must simply be endured.\" A ghost of a smile. \"Alfonso never listened when I tried to tell him these things. Will you?\"",

And news from Naples - given the 99 roll - should be surprisingly positive.\n\nLet me have María respond to these questions naturally, sharing the political landscape she knows.\n\nMaría moves to a writing desk near the window, shuffling through papers—correspondence, reports, the accumulated intelligence of a regent who never stopped watching even after her husband returned.\n\n\"The Cortes is assembling. Zaragoza, not here—they insist on meeting in the traditional seat of Aragonese power, not Barcelona.\" She glances at you. \"You stopped there on your way, yes? Good. That was wise. They will have seen you, measured you. First impressions matter with these men.\"\n\nShe finds the document she was looking for and scans it quickly.\n\n\"The major factions are already positioning themselves. The Catalan merchants want guarantees that Barcelona will not be subordinated to Castilian trade interests. The Aragonese nobility—the old families, the ones who remember when Aragon was the greatest power in the Mediterranean—they fear becoming a junior partner to Castile. The Valencians will follow whichever way the wind blows, as they always do.\"\n\nShe sets the paper down.\n\n\"They will accept you, Juan. Alfonso named you heir, the treaties are clear, and there is no credible alternative. But they will make you pay for that acceptance. They will demand iron guarantees for their fueros, their ancient liberties. They will want promises about where your children will be raised, which courts will have precedence, how the kingdoms will be administered.\"\n\nMaría's expression darkens slightly.\n\n\"Some of them are already talking about requiring Fernando to spend his childhood in Zaragoza. To be raised 'Aragonese' before he inherits.\" She watches your face carefully. \"I tell you this so you are not surprised when they propose it.\"\n\nShe moves to another stack of correspondence, pulling out a letter bearing a Neapolitan seal.\n\n\"As for Naples—\" Her eyebrows rise as she reads, and something like wonder crosses her face. \"This arrived two days ago. I confess I did not believe it when I first read it.\"\n\nShe hands you the letter.\n\n\"The Neapolitan lords have declared for you, Juan. Not merely accepted—declared. The barons who fought beside your knights at Aversa, the men who watched you break René's charge—they remember. They are calling you il Liberatore. The Liberator.\"\n\nMaría shakes her head slowly.\n\n\"They have sent envoys already. They should arrive within the week, bearing formal instruments of succession and a petition begging you to confirm Alfonso's administration in place. They want you, brother. They are not even demanding significant concessions.\"\n\nShe looks at you with something approaching awe.\n\n\"I have watched Italian politics for twenty years. I have never seen anything like this. Naples does not simply accept foreign kings. Naples devours them. And yet here they are, opening their gates before you have even asked.\"\n\nA pause. Her voice drops.\n\n\"The Pope has not yet spoken, of course. Eugenius will want something in return for investing you with the kingdom. But if Naples itself is willing...\" She spreads her hands. \"You may actually hold all three crowns, Juan. Castile, Aragon, Naples. The whole of the western Mediterranean, united under one man.\"\n\nHer eyes meet yours, and there is fear in them now, mixed with the wonder.\n\n\"Do you understand what that means?

To be asked to stand beside a king, not behind him...\n\n\"You want me there? In the Cortes chamber?\" She straightens, and for a moment you see the woman who held Aragon together through her husband's endless Italian adventures. \"Yes. Yes, I will come. They know me. They respect me, some of them. And they will see that you value Aragonese counsel, not merely Castilian.\"\n\nShe is already moving, summoning servants, issuing orders. The widow's grief does not disappear, but it is joined now by purpose.\n\n\"We leave tomorrow. I will send riders ahead—the Cortes must know you come with Alfonso's queen at your side, not as a Castilian conqueror.\"\n\nThe Road to Zaragoza — Late September 1437\n\nThe journey from Barcelona to Zaragoza takes five days at a dignified pace. María rides in a carriage draped in black, mourning colors visible to every village you pass. But she rides with you, and the message is clear: continuity, legitimacy, family.\n\nAlong the way, she educates you.\n\n\"The Justicia of Aragon—Don Martín Díez de Aux—he is the key. The office stands between king and law. In Castile, your word is final. Here, the Justicia can declare royal acts void if they violate the fueros.\" She watches your reaction carefully. \"This will chafe, Juan. I know it will. But if you try to break this office, you will break Aragon itself.\"\n\nShe names the major players: the Archbishop of Zaragoza, who blessed your arrival; the Count of Urgell's heirs, still nursing old grievances; the merchants of Barcelona and Valencia, who care nothing for glory and everything for profit; the old military families who remember when Aragonese knights conquered Sicily, Sardinia, Athens itself.\n\n\"They are proud, Juan. Proud and prickly and impossible. But they are also practical. Show them strength without arrogance, and they will follow.\"\n\nZaragoza — The Aljafería Palace\n\nThe ancient Moorish palace rises from the Aragonese plain, its towers and arches a reminder that this land, too, was once al-Andalus. Here the Cortes of Aragon has gathered, and here you will learn the price of your inheritance.\n\nThe great hall is packed when you enter. Nobles in the colors of a dozen great houses. Clergy in ecclesiastical splendor. Merchants in rich but sober dress. City representatives clutching their municipal charters like shields.\n\nDon Martín Díez de Aux, the Justicia, stands at the center—a lean man in his sixties with the face of a particularly austere saint. He holds a staff of office that is older than the Castilian throne.\n\nWhen you enter with María at your side, a murmur runs through the hall. They had expected you to come as a Castilian king claiming a prize. Instead, you come escorted by their own queen, the woman who held Aragon in trust for two decades.\n\nThe Justicia strikes his staff against the floor. Silence falls.\n\n\"Don Juan, by the grace of God King of Castile and León, Defender of the Faith, called Defensor Romaniae—\" The titles roll out, each one a reminder of your power and, perhaps, a subtle warning of how much power they fear you already hold. \"You come before the Cortes of Aragon to claim the crown that was your cousin Alfonso's, of blessed memory. By treaty and by blood, you assert this right.\"\n\nHe pauses. The hall is utterly still.\n\n\"The Cortes of Aragon acknowledges your claim.\"\n\nA release of breath throughout the chamber. But the Justicia is not finished.\n\n\"However.\" The word falls like a blade. \"Before any crown touches your brow, the Cortes would speak with you regarding the ancient liberties of this realm. We would have certain... assurances.\"\n\nHe gestures to a table where documents are stacked—thick sheaves of parchment covered in dense script. The fueros. The laws. The chains they mean to bind you with.\n\n\"Will you hear our terms, Don Juan?\"",

Maria would be the perfect person to explain this, having been regent for 20 years.\n\nI should have Maria explain this during the journey, which the user requested. This gives Juan (and the player) important context for understanding what he's walking into and why he can't simply claim the crown by right.\n\nMaría settles back against the cushions of the carriage as the Aragonese countryside rolls past—dry hills, ancient olive groves, villages of sun-baked stone. She studies your face for a moment, as if measuring how much you truly want to know.\n\n\"You have ruled Castile for how long now, Juan? Seven years? Eight?\" She shakes her head slowly. \"Everything you know about kingship... set it aside. Aragon is not Castile.\"\n\nShe folds her hands in her lap, falling into the rhythm of a teacher—a role she has clearly played before.\n\n\"In Castile, you are king by the grace of God. Your word is law. The Cortes advises, petitions, grants taxes—but in the end, if you command, they obey. Yes?\"\n\nYou nod.\n\n\"In Aragon, you are king by the grace of God and by agreement with your subjects.\" She lets that sink in. \"There is an old oath—perhaps apocryphal, but it captures the truth of the thing. When an Aragonese king is crowned, the nobles say to him: 'We, who are as good as you, swear to you, who are no better than us, to accept you as our king and sovereign lord, provided you observe all our liberties and laws—but if not, not.'\"\n\nShe watches your reaction.\n\n\"But if not, not. Do you understand, Juan? In Castile, rebellion against the king is treason against God's anointed. In Aragon, if the king violates the fueros, resistance is not merely permitted—it is legally sanctioned. The contract is broken. The king has made himself an oath-breaker, and oath-breakers have no claim to loyalty.\"\n\nThe carriage jolts over a rough patch of road. María steadies herself and continues.\n\n\"The Justicia of Aragon is the embodiment of this principle. He is not your servant, Juan. He is not appointed by you and cannot be removed by you. He stands between king and kingdom, guardian of the ancient laws. If you issue a decree that violates the fueros, the Justicia can declare it void. Void. As if you had never spoken.\"\n\nShe raises a finger.\n\n\"And there is more. In Castile, you can arrest a man on suspicion, hold him at your pleasure, try him in your courts. In Aragon, any freeman—any freeman, Juan, not merely nobles—can invoke the Manifestación. He appeals to the Justicia, and he is taken from your dungeons and held in the Justicia's custody until a proper trial determines his guilt or innocence. The king's hand cannot touch him.\"\n\nMaría's voice carries a note of pride despite herself—pride in the system she has navigated for two decades.\n\n\"The Aragonese say that in Castile, the king makes the law. In Aragon, the law makes the king.\"\n\nYou ask about the crown itself—surely your right by blood and treaty cannot be negotiated?\n\nMaría sighs.\n\n\"Your right is clear. No one disputes that Alfonso named you heir, that the treaties are valid, that your blood claim through your mother is strong. If this were Castile, you would ride into Zaragoza, sit upon the throne, and that would be the end of it.\"\n\nShe shakes her head.\n\n\"But this is Aragon. The Cortes must accept you. They must formally acknowledge your right and vote to receive you as king. And before they do that—before the crown touches your head—they will demand that you swear the coronation oath.\"\n\nShe recites from memory, her voice taking on a formal cadence:\n\n\"'We, who are as good as you, make you, who are no better than us, our King and sovereign lord, so long as you keep and defend our fueros and liberties; and if not, not.'\"\n\nHer eyes meet yours.\n\n\"You must swear, Juan. Publicly, before God and the Cortes, that you will uphold every ancient liberty, every privilege, every fuero that Aragon has accumulated over three centuries. And if you refuse to swear... they will refuse to crown you. Your blood right means nothing without their acceptance.\"\n\n\"So yes,\" María continues, \"there is very much something to negotiate. Not whether you will be king—that is settled. But what kind of king. What guarantees you will give. What promises they can extract while you stand before them needing something only they can grant.\"\n\nShe ticks off points on her fingers.\n\n\"They will demand confirmation of all existing fueros—that is standard, every king does this. But they will also seek new guarantees. Promises that Aragon will not be subordinated to Castile. That the kingdoms will remain separate in law, in administration, in taxation. That Aragonese offices will be held by Aragonese men, not Castilians. That you will visit regularly, hold court in Zaragoza, not rule from Toledo as if Aragon were merely a province.\"\n\nA pause.\n\n\"And they will raise the question of your heir. Fernando. Where will he be raised? By whom? In what language, what court, what traditions?\" María's voice softens. \"Some will demand that he spend years here, in Aragon, learning to be Aragonese before he inherits. They fear that if Fernando is raised entirely Castilian, he will see Aragon as Alfonso saw it—a treasury to fund foreign adventures, not a kingdom to be cherished.\"\n\nShe reaches out and touches your arm.\n\n\"You can refuse any demand, Juan. You are within your rights. But each refusal has a cost. Push too hard, and they will accept you with resentment, watching for any opportunity to reclaim what you denied them. Yield too much, and you will be king in name only, bound by so many promises that you cannot move without their permission.\"\n\nShe sits back, studying you.\n\n\"So. What kind of King of Aragon do you wish to be?\"",

And you... you would bring such constraints to Castile?\"\n\nShe laughs—a short, wondering sound.\n\n\"You are a strange king, brother. Strange and perhaps... perhaps exactly what both kingdoms need.\"\n\nShe settles back, organizing her thoughts.\n\n\"The fueros are not a single document, Juan. They are centuries of accumulated law—privileges granted, liberties confirmed, customs codified. Some date to the earliest days of the Reconquista, when Aragonese kings needed settlers for dangerous frontier lands and granted extraordinary freedoms to attract them.\"\n\nShe begins to count on her fingers.\n\n\"The Privilege of Union—this is the great one, the one that terrifies kings. Granted after the nobility rose against Pedro III in 1287. If the king violates the fueros, the nobles and cities may legally form a Union against him. They may resist by force of arms, and it is not treason. Alfonso's grandfather had it revoked, but the spirit remains—the idea that resistance to tyranny is lawful.\"\n\n\"The Manifestación—I mentioned this. Any freeman accused of a crime may appeal to the Justicia and be removed from royal custody. The king cannot torture or execute him until the Justicia rules on whether proper procedures were followed. This alone has saved hundreds from royal... enthusiasm.\"\n\n\"The Firma de Derecho—a man who believes he will be wrongly prosecuted can seek the Justicia's protection before he is even charged. A kind of preemptive appeal. It drives royal officials mad, but it prevents arbitrary arrest.\"\n\nMaría shifts, warming to her subject. You sense this is knowledge she has accumulated over decades and rarely had occasion to share.\n\n\"Consent to Taxation—the Cortes must approve all new taxes. Not merely advise, Juan. Approve. The king cannot simply decree a levy and collect it. If the Cortes refuses, the treasury remains empty. Alfonso learned this lesson painfully when he needed funds for Naples.\"\n\n\"The Principle of Separate Realms—Aragon, Catalonia, and Valencia are united under one crown but remain legally distinct. Each has its own Cortes, its own laws, its own customs duties. A law passed in Aragon does not apply in Catalonia unless the Catalan Corts approves it separately. You are not King of Aragon, Juan—you will be King of Aragon, Count of Barcelona, and King of Valencia. Three titles, three oaths, three sets of obligations.\"\n\n\"The Cortes Structure—in each realm, the Cortes has multiple brazos, arms. The clergy, the high nobility, the lesser nobility, the cities. All must agree for legislation to pass. One arm can block the others. It makes governance... slow. But it also makes tyranny nearly impossible.\"\n\nShe pauses, gathering her thoughts for the more specific liberties.\n\n\"Rights of the Nobility—Aragonese nobles cannot be imprisoned without trial, cannot have their lands confiscated without judgment of their peers, cannot be tortured under any circumstances. They have the right to wage private war against each other—though not against the king—and to fortify their castles without royal permission.\"\n\n\"Rights of Cities—the major cities hold royal charters guaranteeing self-governance. Barcelona, Zaragoza, Valencia—they elect their own councils, administer their own justice in minor cases, regulate their own trade. The king cannot appoint city officials or override municipal law in local matters.\"\n\n\"Rights of the Peasantry—and here Aragon differs most sharply from Castile.\" María's voice carries a note of pride. \"In Castile, your serfs are bound to the land, yes? In much of Aragon, peasants have the right of free movement. They may leave their lord's estate if they are mistreated, seek better terms elsewhere. The remença system in Catalonia is harsher, but even there, peasants have legal protections unknown in Castile.\"\n\nMaría falls silent for a moment, watching the landscape roll past.\n\n\"There is more, Juan. Centuries more. Specific privileges for specific towns, immunities for specific monasteries, ancient agreements with specific families. The full corpus of the fueros would take months to read and years to understand.\"\n\nShe turns to face you directly.\n\n\"But here is what matters: the fueros are not obstacles to be overcome. They are the soul of Aragon. The Aragonese do not obey their king because he is anointed by God. They obey because he has sworn to uphold the compact between crown and kingdom. Break that compact, and you break Aragon itself.\"\n\nA slight smile crosses her face.\n\n\"You say you like this balance. That you would bring it to Castile. If you mean that truly, Juan—if you can say it to the Cortes and make them believe it—then you will win more than their acceptance. You will win their hearts.\"\n\nShe leans forward.\n\n\"But be warned: the Castilian grandees will not thank you for such ideas. They prosper under a strong king who keeps the lesser nobility in check. Introduce Aragonese liberties to Castile, and you threaten the very foundations of their power.\"\n\nHer eyes search yours.\n\n\"Are you prepared for that fight as well?\"",

      "text": "1. Was the Privilege of Union in force under Alfonso V's rule? María mentioned that \"Alfonso's grandfather had it revoked\" - so this would be Pedro IV of Aragon (1319-1387), who revoked the Privilege of Union after defeating the Union at the Battle of Épila in 1348. So no, it was not formally in force under Alfonso V.\n\n2. Are the fueros written down centrally, or does each noble have their own documents?\n\nThis is a great question about medieval legal administration. I need to think about this historically:\n\n- The fueros were accumulated over centuries\n- Some were general (like the Fueros of Aragon, codified in the 13th century)\n- Some were specific grants to towns, nobles, monasteries\n- There was the \"Vidal Mayor\" - a compilation of Aragonese fueros from the 13th century\n- The Justicia's office would have records\n- But yes, individual grants would also be held by the recipients\n\nMaría would know this intimately from her time as regent. She should explain both the centralized compilations AND the fragmented nature of specific privileges.\n\nI should have María answer both questions in character, showing her knowledge and perhaps hinting at the political implications of Juan's question about central records.\n\nMaría nods slowly, a glint of appreciation in her eyes.\n\n\"You are correct. The Privilege of Union was formally revoked by Pedro IV—Alfonso's great-grandfather—after the Battle of Épila in 1348. The nobles had pushed too far, formed a Union against him, and Pedro crushed them.\" She makes a sharp gesture with her hand. \"He took the original charter, cut it to pieces with his dagger, and supposedly cut his own hand in his fury. They call him Pedro of the Dagger for it.\"\n\nShe pauses.\n\n\"But as I said—the spirit remains. The formal privilege is gone, but the idea that resistance to tyranny is legitimate... that lives in every Aragonese heart. Pedro could destroy the parchment. He could not destroy the principle.\"\n\nYour second question makes her pause longer. She tilts her head, studying you with renewed interest.\n\n\"Now that is a question a ruler asks. Not a warrior, not a crusader—a ruler.\"\n\nShe folds her hands, considering how to explain.\n\n\"The answer is... both. And neither. And therein lies one of Aragon's greatest weaknesses, if a king were clever enough to exploit it.\"\n\nMaría ticks off points as she speaks.\n\n\"The general fueros—the great liberties that apply to all Aragon—those have been compiled. The Fueros de Aragón were codified under Jaime I in the thirteenth century and updated since. The Justicia's office maintains the authoritative copy. Any man may consult them, and the Justicia's scribes will provide certified excerpts for a fee.\"\n\nShe raises a finger.\n\n\"But the specific privileges—the grants to individual towns, monasteries, noble families—those are another matter entirely. Yes, there are chests, Juan. Hundreds of them. Thousands, perhaps. Every abbey has its founding charter. Every city has its royal privileges locked in the municipal archive. Every great family has documents—some genuine, some... enhanced over the centuries—proving their ancient rights.\"\n\nA dry smile crosses her face.\n\n\"When a dispute arises, both parties produce their parchments. The Justicia's court examines the seals, the ink, the Latin, the witness signatures. Sometimes the documents contradict each other. Sometimes one is obviously forged but no one dares say so because the family is too powerful. Sometimes privileges were granted by kings who had no authority to grant them, during civil wars or contested successions, and now no one knows if they are valid or not.\"\n\nShe leans forward, lowering her voice as though sharing a secret.\n\n\"Alfonso tried, once, to create a central registry. A great archive where every privilege would be recorded, every grant catalogued, every charter copied and verified.\" She shakes her head. \"The Cortes rejected it unanimously. Do you know why?\"\n\nShe answers her own question.\n\n\"Because uncertainty protects them. If no one knows exactly what privileges exist, no one can systematically revoke them. A king who wishes to curtail noble rights must fight each family individually, must challenge each document separately, must spend years in legal battles he may not win. But if all the privileges were in one place, in royal custody...\"\n\nMaría spreads her hands.\n\n\"A king might simply lose the inconvenient ones. A fire in the archive, a clumsy scribe, a document that somehow never made it into the registry. The nobles trust the king with their swords but not with their charters.\"\n\nShe sits back, watching you carefully.\n\n\"You are thinking something, brother. I can see it in your eyes. You asked this question for a reason.\"",

      "text": "Juan is proposing a clever political maneuver - using the coronation oath requirement (that he must affirm the fueros) as leverage to demand a central registry. His logic is sound: how can he swear to uphold laws he doesn't know?\n\nMaría would recognize this as a brilliant but dangerous gambit. Let me think through her reaction:\n\n1. She would be impressed by the cleverness\n2. She would also be worried about the resistance this will provoke\n3. She would understand the implications - this could fundamentally shift the balance of power\n\nThe Aragonese nobles will see through this immediately. They know that:\n- A central registry gives the king knowledge of all privileges\n- Knowledge is power - you can't challenge what you don't know exists\n- Royal custody of documents is dangerous\n- This could be used to \"lose\" inconvenient privileges later\n\nBut Juan's argument is legally sound and puts them in a difficult position:\n- They NEED him to swear the oath\n- The oath requires him to affirm the fueros\n- How can he affirm what he doesn't know?\n- If they refuse to show him the fueros, can he be held to them?\n\nThis is the kind of political chess that María would appreciate but also fear. She needs to warn him about the risks while acknowledging the brilliance.\n\nLet me write her response - she should be impressed, cautious, and offer practical advice about how to frame this demand in a way that might actually succeed.\n\nMaría goes very still.\n\nFor a long moment, the only sound is the creak of the carriage wheels and the steady clop of hooves on the road. She stares at you as if seeing you for the first time.\n\n\"Madre de Dios,\" she breathes. \"You are serious.\"\n\nShe presses a hand to her temple, thinking rapidly.\n\n\"Juan, do you understand what you are proposing? Alfonso—my husband, who spent twenty years fighting these people—never dared suggest such a thing. His grandfather crushed a rebellion and still did not demand this. You have been heir to Aragon for less than a month, and you would—\"\n\nShe stops herself. Takes a breath. When she speaks again, her voice is calmer, more analytical.\n\n\"The logic is... the logic is unassailable, actually.\" She sounds almost annoyed to admit it. \"You are correct. They are asking you to swear a sacred oath before God to uphold laws you have never seen. Any notary in Christendom would tell you that a contract cannot bind a man to terms he has not read.\"\n\nShe begins to pace within the confined space of the carriage, her widow's black rustling with each turn.\n\n\"But logic and politics are different beasts, brother. The nobles will see immediately what you are doing. They will understand that a central registry means royal knowledge, and royal knowledge means royal power. They have kept their privileges scattered precisely because—\"\n\nShe stops, turns to face you.\n\n\"Wait. Wait.\"\n\nHer eyes narrow, and you can almost see the political calculation happening behind them.\n\n\"You are not asking them to surrender their documents. You are asking them to present them. For verification. For your oath to be... complete.\"\n\nShe sits down heavily, staring at nothing.\n\n\"If you frame it correctly... if you make it about the sanctity of the oath... they cannot refuse without implying that their privileges cannot withstand scrutiny. That they are asking their king to swear blindly, which makes the oath meaningless. Which means...\"\n\nMaría laughs—a sharp, startled sound.\n\n\"Which means they either produce their documents for the registry, or they admit the coronation oath is mere theater. And if it is mere theater, why should you be bound by it at all?\"\n\nShe shakes her head slowly, wonder and worry warring in her expression.\n\n\"You are putting a knife to their throats and asking them to thank you for the honor of sharpening it.\"\n\nShe is quiet for several minutes, working through the implications.\n\n\"They will resist, Juan. Furiously. The great families will claim their charters are too fragile to move, too sacred to be handled by scribes, too ancient to risk. The monasteries will invoke ecclesiastical privilege—that Church documents cannot be subject to secular registry. The cities will say their archives are municipal property, not subject to royal inspection.\"\n\nShe holds up a hand before you can respond.\n\n\"But—but—if you hold firm, some will comply. The families with legitimate privileges will want them registered, because registration means royal confirmation. A charter in the king's registry cannot be challenged later. It becomes unassailable.\"\n\nA slow smile spreads across her face.\n\n\"And those who refuse... well. Their refusal itself tells you something, doesn't it? A man who will not show his deed to the land is a man whose deed will not bear scrutiny.\"\n\nShe reaches out and grips your arm.\n\n\"You will need to offer them something, Juan. Some guarantee that the registry will not be used against them. Perhaps... perhaps the Justicia maintains custody? Royal scribes make the copies, but the originals return to their owners, and the registry itself is held by the Justicia's office rather than the crown?\"\n\nShe releases your arm and sits back, studying you.\n\n\"It will still be revolutionary. It will still terrify them. But it might—might—be enough to make them swallow it.\"\n\nHer voice drops.\n\n\"What will you do if they refuse entirely? If the Cortes says no registry, no copies, take your oath as written or leave Aragon without a crown?\"",

This was once the pleasure palace of the Banu Hud dynasty, built when Zaragoza was Saraqusta and the emirs held court amid gardens and fountains. Now it serves the Cortes of Aragon, Christian kings having long since consecrated its halls to new purposes.\n\nYou remember it from your visit weeks ago—the brief stop on your triumphant progress from Toledo. But that was ceremony, greeting, first impressions. This is the real work.\n\nMaría walks beside you as you enter the outer courtyard. She has exchanged her traveling clothes for full widow's regalia—black silk, black veil, the pearls that Catalina remembered at her throat. She is a statement in herself: the old reign blessing the new, continuity made flesh.\n\n\"The nobles will gather in the Salon de los Mármoles,\" she murmurs as you walk. \"The Hall of Marbles. It's tradition—that's where the Cortes has met since Pedro IV's time.\"\n\nThe Hall of Marbles\n\nThe chamber is smaller than you expected—intimate, almost, compared to the great halls of Toledo. But every inch speaks of ancient power. Roman columns repurposed from some forgotten ruin. Moorish arches carved with geometric patterns that still carry traces of gold leaf. Christian banners hanging from walls that have seen seven centuries of history.\n\nThe brazos of the Cortes have arranged themselves by tradition: clergy to the left, high nobility to the right, lesser nobility and knights behind them, and the representatives of the cities in the rear. Perhaps two hundred men in total, though the true power rests with perhaps two dozen.\n\nYou recognize faces from your earlier visit.\n\nDon Martín Díez de Aux, the Justicia, stands at the center—tall, austere, his staff of office planted before him like a barrier between king and kingdom. He inclined his head to you at Zaragoza's gates; he does not incline it now. Here, in this chamber, he is the guardian of laws older than your dynasty.\n\nArchbishop Dalmau de Mur of Zaragoza sits among the clergy, splendid in ecclesiastical purple. He blessed your arrival, spoke warmly of Christian unity. But his eyes are watchful now. The Church has its own privileges to protect.\n\nDon Juan de Híjar, head of one of the great noble houses, sits among the high nobility. You shared wine with him on your progress—a bluff, loud man who laughed easily and complained about Catalan merchants undercutting Aragonese wool. His laughter is absent now.\n\nDon Bernat de Centelles, who served as Alfonso's ambassador and accompanied you to Rome years ago, catches your eye and gives an almost imperceptible nod. An ally, perhaps. Or at least not an enemy.\n\nDon Felipe de Castro, whose family claims descent from the old counts of Urgell—the line that once contested the throne against Alfonso's father. His face is a mask, but his presence here is a reminder that not all old wounds have healed.\n\nThe Catalan contingent clusters near the rear: merchants in rich but sober dress, their wealth evident in the quality of their cloth rather than its ostentation. They watch you with the calculating eyes of men who measure everything in profit and loss.\n\nThe murmur of conversation dies as you take your place before the assembly. María settles into a seat set aside for her—not on the dais, but near it, visible to all. The queen who held Aragon, endorsing the king who would claim it.\n\nDon Martín strikes his staff against the marble floor. The sound echoes like a judge's gavel.\n\n\"Don Juan, by the grace of God King of Castile and León, Defender of the Faith, called Defensor Romaniae.\"\n\nThe titles again. The careful enumeration of everything you are—and everything you are not yet.\n\n\"You come before the Cortes of Aragon to claim the crown that was your cousin Alfonso's, of blessed memory. By treaty, by blood, and by Alfonso's own declaration, you assert this right.\"\n\nHe pauses. The hall is utterly silent.\n\n\"The Cortes of Aragon acknowledges the validity of your claim.\"\n\nA release of breath. But the Justicia raises his hand.\n\n\"Before the crown may pass, ancient custom demands that the claimant swear the coronation oath—to uphold the fueros, liberties, and privileges of this realm, as they have been upheld since time immemorial.\"\n\nHe gestures, and a scribe approaches bearing a heavy book—the codified Fueros de Aragón, the general laws. Beside it, a crucifix and a Bible.\n\n\"The oath is sacred and binding. Once sworn, it may not be forsworn. The king who breaks this oath breaks faith with God and with Aragon alike.\"\n\nDon Martín's ancient eyes meet yours.\n\n\"Will you swear, Don Juan? Will you take upon yourself the obligations of Aragonese kingship, as your predecessors have done since the days of Ramiro?\"\n\nThe hall waits.",

Juan's respect for the oath's sanctity should appeal to him. But he'll also see where this is going.\n- The clergy - They'll appreciate the piety, the hand on the Bible\n- The high nobility - They'll be suspicious.

If they say \"no, this is everything,\" they're lying and everyone knows it. If they say \"yes, there are more,\" Juan can reasonably ask to see them before swearing.\n\nI should have the Justicia respond carefully - he's too experienced to fall into an obvious trap, but he also can't deny the fundamental legitimacy of Juan's position.

Don Martín, the Justicia, weighs his words meticulously. His measured response will reveal the delicate political maneuvering at play, balancing legal tradition with Juan's strategic challenge.\n\nA murmur ripples through the hall—surprise, confusion, and something else. Your Catalan is not perfect, but it is fluent, and the effort itself speaks louder than the words. The Catalans in the rear straighten visibly. Don Bernat de Centelles permits himself a small smile.\n\nThe Justicia's expression does not change, but his eyes sharpen. He has been guardian of Aragon's laws for decades. He knows a careful thrust when he sees one.\n\nThe Archbishop of Zaragoza leans forward, purple robes rustling. Several nobles exchange glances. Don Juan de Híjar's mouth opens, then closes. Don Felipe de Castro's mask slips for just a moment, revealing something that might be alarm.\n\nThe silence stretches.\n\nDon Martín Díez de Aux studies you for a long moment. When he speaks, his voice is measured, precise—a judge choosing every word with care.\n\n\"The claimant speaks wisdom.\" The admission costs him something; you can see it in the tightness around his jaw. \"An oath sworn in ignorance is no oath at all. The Church itself teaches that consent requires knowledge.\"\n\nHe gestures to the heavy book before you.\n\n\"These are the Fueros de Aragón—the general laws that bind all men in this realm, king and peasant alike. They have been codified, reviewed, affirmed by every king since Jaime the Conqueror. You may read them today, tomorrow, for as long as you require. This is your right.\"\n\nHe pauses. The hall holds its breath.\n\n\"But you ask if there are other laws. Other fueros.\"\n\nThe Justicia's ancient eyes sweep the chamber—the nobles shifting in their seats, the clergy suddenly fascinated by their own hands, the city representatives clutching their municipal charters.\n\n\"There are... privileges.\" He chooses the word carefully. \"Grants made by previous kings to particular towns, monasteries, noble houses. Immunities. Exemptions. Customs confirmed by royal seal. These are not contained in the codified fueros. They are held by those to whom they were granted.\"\n\nDon Juan de Híjar rises to his feet, face reddening.\n\n\"The general fueros are what the king swears to uphold! The specific privileges are between each house and the crown—they are not the Cortes' affair!\"\n\n\"The fueros are precisely the Cortes' affair!\" Don Felipe de Castro is on his feet now too, seizing an opportunity to oppose. \"If the claimant wishes to question the validity of ancient grants—\"\n\n\"No one has questioned anything,\" the Archbishop interjects smoothly, his voice cutting through the rising clamor. \"The claimant has merely asked what exists. Surely there is no harm in knowledge.\"\n\nThe hall erupts into competing voices. The Justicia strikes his staff against the floor—once, twice, three times—until silence returns.\n\nDon Martín's gaze settles on you once more.\n\n\"You have asked a question, Don Juan. The answer is: yes. There are privileges beyond what is written in this book. Hundreds of them. Perhaps thousands. They are scattered across Aragon, Catalonia, and Valencia, held in archives and strongboxes and monastery vaults.\"\n\nHe spreads his hands—a gesture that might be helplessness or might be warning.\n\n\"No king has ever read them all. No king has ever seen them all. The oath you are asked to swear is the oath every King of Aragon has sworn: to uphold the fueros and the ancient liberties of the realm.

A protection for everyone - including the nobles themselves\n2. An extension of Aragonese principles they already value (transparency, the Justicia as neutral guardian)\n3. A way to prevent future disputes and forgeries\n\nThis is clever because:\n- It uses their own values against them\n- It suggests the Justicia would maintain custody (neutral party)\n- It frames opposition as being in favor of potential fraud\n- It implies that those who oppose have something to hide\n\nI need to show the mixed reaction in the hall. Some will see through this immediately as a power play. Others will be genuinely persuaded by the logic. The Justicia is key - his reaction matters most.\n\nLet me think about who would react how:\n\n- Don Martín (Justicia): This actually increases his power and office's importance. He might be intrigued, even if cautious.\n- Archbishop: Church has its own privileges to protect, might be wary\n- Don Juan de Híjar: Already opposed, probably has privileges that won't bear scrutiny\n- Don Felipe de Castro: Urgell pretender family - might oppose on principle, or might see opportunity\n- Don Bernat de Centelles: Friendly to Juan, might support\n- Catalans/merchants: Might actually like clarity and transparency - it's good for business\n\nThe key tension: Juan is using impeccable logic that's hard to argue against without seeming to hide something.

You actually did it, her expression says. You mad, brilliant fool.\n\nThe Justicia does not move. His ancient face is unreadable, but something flickers in his eyes—surprise, perhaps, or the recalculation of a man who has just discovered the ground beneath his feet is not where he thought it was.\n\nThe silence stretches. Someone coughs. A chair creaks.\n\nThen Don Bernat de Centelles rises.\n\n\"The claimant speaks sense.\" His voice carries the calm authority of a man who has navigated papal courts and royal councils across Europe. \"I have served the crown of Aragon for thirty years. In that time, I have seen privileges produced from nowhere to justify all manner of claims. I have seen documents that contradicted each other, both bearing royal seals. I have seen men win cases with charters their grandfathers would not have recognized.\"\n\nHe turns to face the nobility directly.\n\n\"How many of you have had your own rights challenged by a neighbor waving a parchment you had never seen before? How many have spent years in litigation because no one could determine which grant took precedence?\"\n\nUncomfortable shifting among the noble benches. Don Bernat has touched a nerve.\n\n\"A central registry, maintained by the Justicia—\" he gestures toward Don Martín, \"—would protect all of us. A registered privilege cannot be disputed. An unregistered one...\" He shrugs elegantly. \"Well. It invites questions, does it not?\"\n\nDon Juan de Híjar surges to his feet again.\n\n\"This is a Castilian trick!\" His voice echoes off the marble columns. \"The claimant has been king of Aragon for less than a month—he has not even been crowned—and already he seeks to catalogue our liberties so he may later curtail them!\"\n\n\"How?\" Don Bernat's response is immediate, almost lazy. \"The registry would be held by the Justicia, not the crown. The Justicia whom no king can remove. The Justicia whose office exists precisely to prevent royal overreach.\" He spreads his hands. \"If anything, the claimant is strengthening the Justicia's authority, not the crown's.\"\n\n\"The Justicia already adjudicates disputes over privileges,\" Don Felipe de Castro interjects, rising smoothly. His voice is measured, thoughtful—more dangerous than Híjar's bluster. \"We do not need a registry for that. The system has functioned for centuries.\"\n\n\"Has it?\" One of the Catalan merchants has spoken—a breach of protocol that draws sharp looks from the nobility. But the man continues, undeterred. \"In Barcelona, we spend more on litigation over ancient grants than we do on harbor maintenance. Every contract, every transaction, someone produces a privilege that exempts them from this tax or that obligation. Half of them are genuine. Half are...\" He trails off, the implication clear.\n\nThe Archbishop clears his throat.\n\n\"The Church, of course, maintains its own archives. Ecclesiastical privileges are a matter for Rome, not for any secular registry.\" His tone is pleasant, but the warning is unmistakable. Do not touch our documents.\n\nThe Justicia raises his hand. Slowly, the hall quiets.\n\nDon Martín Díez de Aux looks at you with an expression that has shifted subtly. There is still wariness there, still the guardian's instinctive suspicion of royal power. But there is something else now—respect, perhaps, or at least acknowledgment that he is dealing with a mind that understands the game.\n\n\"The claimant proposes a registry of privileges, to be maintained by the office of the Justicia.\" He states it flatly, without judgment. \"This is... unprecedented. No King of Aragon has ever required such a thing.\"\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\"But the claimant is correct that he cannot swear to uphold laws he has not seen. And he is correct that the current system invites... uncertainty.\"\n\nThe Justicia's gaze sweeps the hall.\n\n\"The Cortes must deliberate. This is not a matter that can be decided in a single session.\" He looks back to you. \"You have asked for a day to read the codified fueros. You shall have it. While you read, the Cortes will discuss your... proposal.\"\n\nHis staff strikes the marble floor.\n\n\"We shall reconvene tomorrow. The claimant will swear upon the Fueros de Aragón as codified. The matter of a broader registry will be addressed separately.\"\n\nHe pauses, and something almost like a smile touches his thin lips.\n\n\"I suspect the discussion will be... vigorous.\"\n\nThe session breaks. Nobles cluster in groups, voices low and urgent. Don Juan de Híjar is gesturing angrily to a circle of supporters. Don Bernat de Centelles catches your eye and inclines his head—a small gesture of alliance. The Catalan merchants have gathered in a tight knot, speaking rapidly in their own tongue.\n\nMaría appears at your elbow.\n\n\"You have set the cat among the pigeons, brother.\" Her voice is barely above a whisper. \"Half of them are terrified, and the other half are trying to decide if you are their savior or their doom.\"\n\nShe glances toward the Justicia, who is conferring with the Archbishop in low tones.\n\n\"Don Martín is intrigued. I can see it. A registry under his office's control would make the Justicia the most powerful institution in Aragon—more powerful than the crown itself, in some ways.\" Her lips curve. \"You have offered him an empire, Juan. The question is whether he trusts you enough to take it.\"",

      "text": "In Castile, the king has more absolute power - the Cortes advises but the king's word is law. So creating a registry there would be more straightforward from a legal standpoint, but politically it could face resistance from nobles who benefit from ambiguity.\n\nIn Naples, Juan just inherited it with overwhelming support (roll 99), but it's an Italian kingdom with different traditions and he'll need to govern through a viceroy.\n\nLet me have Diego respond thoughtfully and practically.\n\nDiego de Daza looks up from the documents he has been reviewing—financial reports from Álvaro, figures on the Aragonese treasury, the endless paperwork that follows you even to foreign crowns. He sets down his quill, considering the question with the methodical care that has made him invaluable.\n\n\"Castile first, Your Majesty.\" He steeples his fingers. \"It can be done. In fact, it would be easier than here in Aragon. Your word is law in Castile—you need not negotiate with a Cortes that can refuse you. A royal decree establishing a registry, housed in... Toledo, perhaps, or Burgos... and requiring all noble privileges to be registered within a set period.\"\n\nHe pauses, the administrator's caution surfacing.\n\n\"But easier does not mean easy. The Castilian grandees have grown comfortable with ambiguity. The Mendozas, the Enríquez, the Guzmáns—they hold privileges accumulated over centuries, some granted by kings whose authority to grant them was... questionable. The civil wars, the minorities, the regencies—every period of weakness produced a flood of grants, many of which would not survive scrutiny.\"\n\nDiego reaches for a fresh sheet of paper, already sketching notes.\n\n\"If you announce a registry, you must decide what happens to unregistered privileges. Do they become void? That would provoke rebellion. Do they remain valid but unenforceable? That invites endless litigation. Or do you offer an amnesty period—register now, no questions asked, and your privilege is confirmed forever—after which unregistered claims are presumed invalid?\"\n\nHe taps the paper thoughtfully.\n\n\"The amnesty approach is safest. It gives the nobles something—confirmation—in exchange for transparency. Those with legitimate grants will rush to register. Those with... questionable documents... will face a choice: register and risk scrutiny, or let their claims lapse quietly.\"\n\nIsaac de Baeza has been listening from the shadows near the window—his customary position, close enough to hear, far enough to be forgotten. He steps forward now, his dark eyes thoughtful.\n\n\"Naples is another matter entirely, Your Majesty.\"\n\nHis voice is soft, as always—a man who has learned that whispers carry further than shouts.\n\n\"You have inherited a kingdom that wants you. That is rare. That is precious. And it is fragile.\" He spreads his hands. \"The Neapolitan barons supported Alfonso because he was strong and because he defeated their enemies. They support you because you helped him win and because they fear the alternative. But they are Italians, Your Majesty. They have survived Normans, Germans, French, Aragonese. They survive by adapting, by accommodating, by waiting.\"\n\nIsaac glances toward the door, ensuring no servants linger.\n\n\"If you announce a registry in Naples before you have set foot in the kingdom as its king—before you have appointed a viceroy, confirmed the administration, shown yourself to the barons in person—they will see it as a threat. They will wonder what else the new Iberian master plans to impose. The goodwill you have earned will curdle into suspicion.\"\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\"Castile is yours by blood and long rule. Aragon is yours by treaty and family. Naples is yours by... gratitude and opportunity. The first two can bear the weight of reform. The third must be wooed before it is governed.\"\n\nDiego nods slowly, acknowledging Isaac's point.\n\n\"The spymaster speaks truth, Your Majesty. Naples must wait. But Castile...\" He looks up, a rare gleam of enthusiasm in his usually cautious eyes. \"Castile could be done within a year. A royal decree, a registry office, a period of amnesty. By the time you return from Aragon, I could have the framework prepared.\"\n\nHe hesitates.\n\n\"There is one other consideration, Your Majesty. If you establish registries in both Castile and Aragon—similar systems, similar rules, maintained by similar offices—you create a precedent. The kingdoms remain separate in law, but their administration begins to harmonize. Over time, over generations...\"\n\nHe does not finish the sentence. He does not need to.\n\nMaría, who has entered quietly during the conversation, speaks from the doorway.\n\n\"You are not merely claiming crowns, are you, brother?\" Her voice is soft, wondering. \"You are building something. Something that will outlast us all.\"",

      "text": "Juan is asking a very astute question. He's noticed that the Fueros de Aragón focus heavily on limiting royal power and protecting noble/citizen rights, but say almost nothing about what the nobility owes to the crown - military service, taxation, loyalty obligations, etc.\n\nThis is actually historically accurate. The Aragonese fueros were primarily about constraining royal authority, not about defining noble duties. Military obligations in medieval Aragon were handled through separate feudal arrangements, not codified in the same document as the liberties.\n\nMaría, Diego, or Isaac should be able to answer this. María knows Aragon best. Let me think about what the military situation would be:\n\n1. The Crown of Aragon's military strength came from:\n- The nobility's feudal obligations (not well-defined, often contested)\n- The almogávares (light infantry, famous mercenaries)\n- Catalan naval power\n- Mercenaries funded by taxation (which required Cortes approval)\n\n2. The lack of clear military obligations in the fueros is a weakness - nobles could refuse to serve or provide minimal support\n\n3. Compared to Castile, where the king could more easily command military service, Aragon was dependent on negotiation\n\nLet me have María explain this, as she has the most direct experience with governing Aragon.\n\nMaría leans forward, a bitter smile crossing her face.\n\n\"Now you see it. The great gap in the Aragonese system.\"\n\nShe rises and moves to the table, turning pages until she finds what she is looking for—or rather, what she is not looking for.\n\n\"The fueros speak endlessly of what the king may not do. They are silent on what the nobility must do.\" She taps the parchment. \"There is no article requiring military service. No fixed obligation of knights or men-at-arms. No muster system. No penalty for a noble who simply... fails to appear when summoned.\"\n\nDiego frowns, the administrator in him offended by the asymmetry. \"Then how did Alfonso wage his wars? How did the kings before him defend the realm?\"\n\n\"By asking.\" María's voice carries decades of frustration. \"By negotiating. By offering concessions in exchange for troops. Every campaign Alfonso launched required months of bargaining with the Cortes. 'Grant us this privilege, and we will grant you soldiers. Confirm that immunity, and we will fund your fleet.'\"\n\nShe returns to her chair, smoothing her black skirts.\n\n\"Alfonso spent twenty years conquering Naples. Do you know how many Aragonese knights fought beside him at any given time? A few hundred. Perhaps a thousand in the great battles. He won his Italian kingdom with Catalan mercenaries, Neapolitan turncoats, and money—money extracted from the Cortes tax by tax, subsidy by subsidy, each one purchased with a new limitation on royal authority.\"\n\nIsaac speaks from his corner, his voice thoughtful.\n\n\"The Castilian system is different, Your Majesty. The hueste real—the royal host—can be summoned by decree. The nobility owes forty days of service per year. Refusal is treason.\" He pauses. \"The Aragonese system assumes that if the king wants an army, he must make it worth the nobles' while to provide one.\"\n\n\"And if he cannot pay?\" you ask.\n\n\"Then he has no army.\" María's answer is flat. \"Or a very small one. Pedro IV nearly lost his throne because he could not compel the nobility to fight the Union. He won in the end, but only by hiring Castilian mercenaries—paid for by pawning the crown jewels.\"\n\nDiego has been making notes. He looks up now, his expression troubled.\n\n\"What forces can Aragon field, Your Majesty? If we are to plan for the Ottoman war—\"\n\nMaría considers the question carefully.\n\n\"The Crown of Aragon—Aragon proper, Catalonia, Valencia, the islands—could theoretically field perhaps eight to ten thousand men. Knights, men-at-arms, crossbowmen, the almogàvers if any still serve.\" She shakes her head. \"But theoretically means nothing. In practice, you would be fortunate to gather four thousand without offering significant concessions. And maintaining them in the field requires money the Cortes must approve.\"\n\nShe meets your eyes.\n\n\"Alfonso's Neapolitan army was perhaps six thousand men at its peak, and half of those were Italians fighting for pay or revenge against the Angevins. The fleet is more reliable—Barcelona's shipyards can produce galleys, and the Catalans will fight at sea for profit if nothing else. But land forces?\" She spreads her hands. \"You are King of Aragon, brother. But you cannot command an Aragonese army. You can only request one.\"\n\nIsaac steps closer, lowering his voice.\n\n\"Your Majesty, this is why your Castilian muster system is so valuable. In Castile, you have built something the Aragonese kings never achieved—a mechanism for requiring military contribution, with records, with accountability, with consequences for failure.\"\n\nHe glances at the fueros on the table.\n\n\"If you wish Aragon to contribute meaningfully to the war against the Sultan, you have two choices. You can negotiate each contribution separately, paying for every soldier with political concessions. Or...\"\n\nHe trails off, letting you complete the thought.\n\nDiego finishes it for him. \"Or you propose that Aragon adopt something similar to the Castilian system. A registry of military obligations. A muster system. Clear requirements for noble service.\"\n\nMaría laughs—a sharp, incredulous sound. \"You have been King of Aragon for less than a month, and you would propose to impose military obligations on the nobility? They will say you mean to turn Aragon into a province of Castile. They will say this is precisely why they feared a Castilian king.\"\n\nShe pauses, studying your face.\n\n\"Unless...\"\n\n\"Unless?\" you prompt.\n\n\"Unless you frame it differently.\" Her eyes narrow, thinking. \"You spoke today of transparency. Of a registry of fueros so that all may know what obligations exist. What if you proposed not to impose new obligations, but to clarify existing ones?\"\n\nShe rises again, pacing.\n\n\"The nobility does owe service to the crown. It is assumed, understood, part of the feudal compact. It simply is not written. What if you proposed to write it down? To establish clearly what each house owes, so that there can be no dispute, no evasion, no convenient forgetfulness when the summons comes?\"\n\nHer voice takes on a sharper edge.\n\n\"And what if you proposed that houses which exceed their obligations receive recognition? Titles, honors, precedence? While houses that fail to meet them...\"\n\nShe does not finish the sentence. She does not need to.",

Key taxes included:\n   - The \"coronatge\" and \"maridatge\" - occasional taxes for coronations and royal marriages\n   - Customs duties (drets) on trade\n   - Revenue from royal estates\n   - The \"generalitats\" - administered by the Diputació del General in Catalonia\n   - Subsidies voted by the Cortes\n\nThe revenue was significantly less than Castile's because:\n1. The king couldn't impose taxes unilaterally\n2. Much of the revenue was controlled by the Diputació (standing committees of the Cortes)\n3. The separate realms (Aragon, Catalonia, Valencia) had separate tax systems\n\nI should have María or Diego explain this, drawing on reasonable historical estimates. The Crown of Aragon's royal revenue was probably in the range of 100,000-200,000 florins annually in the 15th century, much less than Castile's. But I should frame this as informed speculation within the roleplay.\n\nLet me have María explain the tax system and its revenues.\n\nMaría exchanges a glance with Diego—the practiced administrator recognizing the question's importance.\n\n\"This is where Aragon truly differs from Castile,\" she says. \"In Castile, you have the alcabala, the tercias reales, the customs, the royal monopolies—all flowing to the crown by established right. Here...\"\n\nShe sighs, settling back into her chair.\n\n\"Here, the king has very little that is truly his.\"\n\nDiego pulls out a fresh sheet of paper, ready to take notes. María begins to enumerate, counting on her fingers.\n\n\"The Royal Patrimony. Lands, castles, and estates held directly by the crown. These produce rents—perhaps thirty to forty thousand florins annually across all the realms. But Alfonso pawned much of it to fund his Italian wars. Some estates are mortgaged for decades to come. The actual revenue reaching the treasury is... less.\"\n\n\"The Coronatge and Maridatge. Special taxes levied only on specific occasions—the coronation of a new king, the marriage of a royal child. These can raise significant sums, but they are occasional, not annual. You will receive coronation taxes, brother. Perhaps fifty thousand florins across the realms, if the Cortes is generous.\"\n\n\"Customs and Duties. The drets on trade passing through the ports—Barcelona, Valencia, Mallorca. This is the most reliable revenue. Perhaps sixty to seventy thousand florins annually. But much of it is collected by the cities themselves, who take their share before passing the remainder to the crown.\"\n\nShe pauses, her expression souring.\n\n\"The Generalitats. And here is the great innovation that has crippled Aragonese kings for a century.\"\n\nMaría rises and moves to the window, looking out over Zaragoza.\n\n\"In Castile, when the Cortes grants a tax, royal officials collect it. In Aragon, the Cortes decided long ago that they did not trust the king with their money. So they created standing committees—the Diputació del General in Catalonia, similar bodies in Aragon and Valencia—to collect and administer the taxes themselves.\"\n\nShe turns back to face you.\n\n\"When the Cortes grants a subsidy for war, the Diputació collects it. The Diputació decides how it is spent. The Diputació pays the soldiers directly. The king sees the army but never touches the coin.\" Her voice is bitter. \"Alfonso begged the Diputació for years to fund his Naples campaigns. They granted money in dribs and drabs, always with conditions, always with oversight, always reminding him that they held the purse strings.\"\n\nDiego looks up from his notes, appalled. \"The king cannot even collect his own taxes?\"\n\n\"The king can collect his taxes—the patrimony, the customs that are truly royal. But the subsidies—the grants from the Cortes for war, for great undertakings—those pass through the Diputació. And the Diputació is controlled by the Cortes, not the crown.\"\n\nIsaac speaks from his corner, his voice soft but precise.\n\n\"What is the total, then? If Your Majesty wished to know what revenues you may actually command as King of Aragon?\"\n\nMaría considers, calculating silently.\n\n\"In a normal year—without a coronation tax, without a special subsidy—the crown receives perhaps one hundred thousand florins. Perhaps one hundred twenty thousand in a good year.\" She spreads her hands. \"Across three realms, with all their wealth, all their trade, all their great cities. One hundred thousand florins.\"\n\nDiego's quill has stopped moving. He stares at the numbers he has written.\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" he says slowly, \"Castile's revenue this year will exceed three hundred eighty thousand florins. The treasury holds over five hundred thousand. A single year of Castilian income exceeds three years of Aragonese royal revenue.\"\n\n\"Now you understand,\" María says quietly, \"why Alfonso spent his reign chasing Naples instead of governing Aragon. There was nothing to govern. No money to build with, no army to command, no power to wield save what the Cortes deigned to grant him. Naples offered what Aragon denied—a kingdom where a king could actually rule.\"\n\nShe meets your eyes.\n\n\"And now Naples is yours, brother. Along with all of Aragon's constraints. The richest crown in Italy, and the poorest crown in Iberia, united in your person.\"\n\nDiego is still calculating, his administrator's mind working through implications.\n\n\"Your Majesty, if we combine the revenues... Castile at three hundred eighty thousand, Aragon at one hundred thousand, Naples at...\" He looks to María. \"What does Naples yield?\"\n\nMaría shakes her head. \"I do not know precisely. Alfonso kept his Italian finances separate. But Naples is wealthy—the grain trade, the ports, the silk. Perhaps two hundred thousand florins? Perhaps more, if well-administered?\"\n\n\"Nearly seven hundred thousand florins annually,\" Diego breathes. \"From three crowns. More than any king in Christendom save perhaps the King of France.\"\n\nIsaac's voice cuts through the wonder. \"Revenue means nothing if it cannot be used, Your Majesty. Castilian florins can fund Castilian armies. Aragonese florins—such as they are—can only fund what the Diputació approves. And Neapolitan florins must maintain Naples, or the barons will find another king.\"\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\"Three treasuries. Three systems. Three sets of constraints. You are the richest king in Christendom on paper. In practice...\"\n\nHe leaves the thought unfinished.",

      "text": "1. City autonomy in Aragon was significant - chartered cities had considerable independence\n2. The fueros protected municipal liberties\n3. Reform would require navigating the Cortes and potentially the cities themselves\n4. This connects to Juan's broader agenda of creating registries and transparency\n\nMaría has been living this system for 20 years as regent. She would know the practical details intimately.\n\nMaría tilts her head, studying you with renewed interest.\n\n\"You are thinking like an administrator now, not a crusader. Good. You will need both minds to rule here.\"\n\nShe returns to the table, pulling the fueros toward her and flipping to the relevant sections.\n\n\"The answer is: it depends on the city, and it depends on the tax.\"\n\n\"Royal customs—the drets on foreign trade entering or leaving the realm—these are technically the king's. But collection has been delegated to the cities for centuries. Barcelona collects the customs at Barcelona's port. Valencia at Valencia's. They take a share for their trouble—typically a quarter to a third—and remit the remainder to the crown.\"\n\nShe taps Article 36 in the fueros.\n\n\"Municipal taxes—levies for local purposes, market fees, gate tolls—these are entirely the city's own. The king has no claim on them. The city council decides the rates, collects the money, spends it as they see fit. Roads, walls, fountains, the night watch—all funded from municipal revenue that never touches royal hands.\"\n\n\"And then there are the Cortes subsidies—the special grants for war or great undertakings. These are collected by the Diputació, as I said. The cities contribute their share according to formulas negotiated generations ago, but the money flows to the Diputació, not to the crown and not back to the cities.\"\n\nDiego leans forward. \"Can the collection structure be reformed, Your Majesty asks. In Castile, this would be a matter of royal decree. Here...?\"\n\nMaría laughs softly—not with humor, but with the weariness of long experience.\n\n\"Here, brother, you must understand something fundamental. The cities are not your subjects in the way Castilian cities are. They are your partners. They joined the Crown of Aragon by agreement—Barcelona most of all. When the Count of Barcelona united with the Kingdom of Aragon in 1137, it was a marriage of equals, not a conquest. The Catalans never forget this.\"\n\nShe counts off points on her fingers.\n\n\"To reform how royal customs are collected, you would need to renegotiate with each city individually. Their charters—the privilegis—specify the arrangements. Change requires their consent, or you violate the fueros.\"\n\n\"To claim a larger share of what they collect, you would face immediate resistance. They will say they have collected the customs for centuries at the current rate. They will produce documents—genuine or otherwise—proving their rights. They will appeal to the Justicia.\"\n\n\"To impose new taxes on trade, you require the Cortes' approval. And the cities sit in the Cortes. They will vote against anything that costs them money.\"\n\nIsaac speaks, his voice thoughtful.\n\n\"Yet the system is not immutable, Your Majesty. It has changed before. The Diputació itself is only a century old—created because the Cortes wanted control over subsidies. What was created can be... modified.\"\n\nMaría nods slowly. \"The spymaster is correct. Reform is possible. But it is slow. It requires building coalitions, offering trades, finding nobles or cities who benefit from change and setting them against those who resist.\"\n\nShe looks at you directly.\n\n\"Alfonso never had the patience for it. He preferred to squeeze what he could from the existing system and chase richer prizes in Italy. But you...\"\n\nShe pauses, considering.\n\n\"You have something Alfonso never had. You have Castile. You do not need Aragonese revenue to survive. You can afford to be patient, to negotiate from strength rather than desperation. And you have a cause—the Ottoman war, the defense of Christendom—that might unite factions who would otherwise oppose any change.\"\n\nDiego has been scribbling calculations. He looks up now.\n\n\"Your Majesty, if I may suggest a strategy?\"\n\nYou nod.\n\n\"Do not attempt to reform the collection of taxes. That battle is too large, too entrenched, too protected by centuries of charter and custom. Instead, reform the accounting of taxes.\"\n\nHe spreads his hands.\n\n\"Propose that all revenues—royal customs, municipal taxes, Cortes subsidies—be recorded in a central registry. Not collected centrally, merely reported. The cities keep their autonomy, their collection rights, their spending discretion. But they must report what they collect and how they spend it.\"\n\nMaría's eyes widen slightly. \"Transparency again. The same principle as the registry of fueros.\"\n\n\"Precisely.\" Diego's voice carries quiet enthusiasm. \"Once you have accurate records, you know the true wealth of the realm. You know which cities prosper and which struggle. You know where money disappears between collection and remittance. And when you do propose reforms—years hence, when trust is established—you have evidence. Numbers that cannot be disputed.\"\n\nIsaac adds, softly: \"Knowledge is power, Your Majesty. Even when it is not yet authority.\"\n\nMaría is quiet for a long moment, studying the three of you—the king, the administrator, the spymaster.\n\n\"You are not merely claiming Aragon,\" she says finally. \"You are planning to rebuild it. Stone by stone, record by record, registry by registry. While the nobles argue about fueros and privileges, you will be quietly constructing the machinery of a modern state around them.\"\n\nShe shakes her head slowly.\n\n\"Alfonso would have laughed at such patience. He wanted glory, conquest, immediate triumph. But this...\" She gestures at Diego's notes, at the fueros on the table, at the map of three kingdoms you now rule. \"This is something else entirely.\"\n\nHer eyes meet yours.\n\n\"Does Álvaro know what you are building, brother? Does anyone?\"",

      "text": "María has explained that:\n1. Municipal taxes - entirely the city's own\n2. Royal customs (drets) - technically the king's, but collection delegated to cities who take 25-33% as their share\n3. Cortes subsidies - collected by the Diputació\n\nThe user is asking: shouldn't the trade revenue (royal customs) belong to the crown? Why are cities taking a cut?\n\nThis is a reasonable question and María should explain the historical reality - that over time, what was once clearly royal revenue has become entangled with city administration, and the cities have established \"customary\" rights to their share through long practice. The king's theoretical ownership has been eroded by practical delegation.\n\nThis is also an opportunity for María to explain that this is exactly the kind of thing that could potentially be reformed - but carefully.\n\nMaría's expression sharpens—you have touched on a nerve that has vexed Aragonese kings for generations.\n\n\"In theory, yes. Absolutely yes.\" She rises, pacing with the restless energy of old frustration. \"The customs on foreign trade—the drets, the lleudes, the peatges—these are royal prerogatives. They belong to the crown by ancient right. Every king of Aragon has theoretically owned the revenue from trade passing through Barcelona, Valencia, Mallorca.\"\n\nShe stops, turning to face you.\n\n\"In practice...\"\n\n\"In practice, the cities have been collecting these revenues on the crown's behalf for two hundred years. What began as delegation—the king lacks officials in every port, so the city collects and remits—became custom. What was custom became right. What was right became privilege.\"\n\nShe moves to the table, searching through the fueros until she finds what she wants.\n\n\"Look here. Article 34: 'Chartered cities may elect their own councils, judges, and officers according to their customs.' Article 36: 'Chartered cities may levy local taxes for municipal purposes without royal permission.' The fueros do not explicitly grant cities the right to skim royal customs. But they establish the principle that cities govern themselves.\"\n\nMaría's voice grows bitter.\n\n\"And so when a king challenges Barcelona's 'customary' share of the customs revenue, Barcelona's lawyers argue that collection is a form of self-governance. That their share is payment for services rendered—the maintenance of the port, the harbor watch, the warehouses, the weighmasters. That to take their share would be to violate their ancient liberties.\"\n\nDiego interjects, his administrator's mind working. \"But surely there are records? Charters specifying exactly what the cities may keep and what they must remit?\"\n\n\"Some.\" María shrugs. \"Old documents, contradictory documents, documents that have been interpreted generously over the centuries. Barcelona's charter from Jaime I grants them certain rights over their port. Does that include a third of the customs revenue? Barcelona says yes. The crown has said no. The dispute has simmered for a hundred years without resolution.\"\n\nShe returns to her seat, suddenly weary.\n\n\"Alfonso tried, once, to reclaim the full customs. He sent royal collectors to Barcelona to take direct control of the port. Do you know what happened?\"\n\nYou shake your head.\n\n\"The city council declared it a violation of their privileges. The guilds closed their shops. The dockworkers refused to unload ships. Trade stopped entirely for three weeks.\" María's laugh is hollow. \"Alfonso earned nothing—nothing—and nearly provoked a revolt. He backed down, restored the old arrangement, and never tried again.\"\n\nIsaac speaks from his corner, his voice soft and precise.\n\n\"The cities hold the king hostage, Your Majesty. Barcelona alone handles perhaps half of Aragon's foreign trade. Valencia another third. If they refuse to cooperate, trade dies. If trade dies, the customs yield nothing—not the city's share, not the crown's share. Nothing.\"\n\nHe steps closer, lowering his voice.\n\n\"This is why knowledge matters. Right now, the crown does not truly know what Barcelona collects. The city reports a number, remits a share, and the king accepts it because he has no means of verification. If the true customs revenue is one hundred thousand florins and Barcelona reports eighty thousand, who would know? The merchants will not tell the king—they prefer dealing with the city. The city will not tell the king—they profit from the arrangement.\"\n\nDiego nods vigorously. \"A central accounting registry. Require that all trade be recorded—every ship, every cargo, every duty paid. The cities still collect, still keep their customary share. But the crown knows what passes through the ports. And if the numbers do not match...\"\n\nMaría watches this exchange with growing wonder.\n\n\"You would not challenge the cities directly. You would simply... count.\"\n\n\"Counting is not a violation of anyone's fueros,\" Diego says. \"Recording trade is not seizing revenue. It is merely... transparency. The same principle as the registry of privileges.\"\n\n\"And once you know the true numbers,\" Isaac adds, \"you can negotiate from strength. 'Barcelona, your charter entitles you to one-quarter of the customs. Our records show you have been taking one-third. We do not accuse—perhaps there was confusion. Let us clarify the arrangement going forward.'\"\n\nMaría shakes her head slowly. \"They will resist. They will claim that royal inspectors in their ports violate their autonomy.\"\n\n\"Then propose that the Diputació conduct the accounting,\" Diego counters. \"Or the Justicia's office. An Aragonese institution, not a Castilian imposition. The numbers would still reach the crown eventually.\"\n\nMaría is silent for a long moment. When she speaks, her voice is strange—half admiration, half fear.\n\n\"You understand, brother, that what you are proposing—the registry of privileges, the accounting of revenues, the slow accumulation of knowledge—this is more dangerous to the Aragonese system than any army. Armies can be fought. Knowledge...\"\n\nShe trails off.\n\n\"Knowledge changes what is possible. Once you know the true wealth of the realm, once you have records that cannot be disputed, the old arrangements become... negotiable. Not today. Not this year. But eventually.\"\n\nShe looks at you with new eyes.\n\n\"Is this what you learned in Constantinople? This patient construction of power beneath the surface of tradition?\"",

Based on the earlier information, this would be Archbishop Dalmau de Mur of Zaragoza, who was mentioned as being present at the Cortes and who blessed Juan's arrival.\n\nLet me think about what Juan might want to discuss with the clergy:\n1. The registry of fueros - ecclesiastical privileges\n2. Church support for his coronation\n3. The Ottoman war / crusade\n4. Potentially the accounting/transparency proposals\n\nThe Archbishop earlier stated that \"The Church, of course, maintains its own archives. Ecclesiastical privileges are a matter for Rome, not for any secular registry.\" This is a potential point of resistance.\n\nI should set up the scene of Juan meeting with the Archbishop and other senior clergy in Aragon.\n\nThe Aljafería Palace — The Evening Before the Second Session\n\nWord is sent, and within the hour, the senior clergy of Aragon begin to arrive at your chambers.\n\nArchbishop Dalmau de Mur of Zaragoza comes first—the most powerful churchman in Aragon proper, resplendent even in his traveling robes. He is perhaps sixty, with the soft hands of a scholar and the sharp eyes of a politician. He blessed your arrival at the gates; he watched silently from the clergy's bench as you challenged the Cortes on the matter of fueros. His expression now is carefully neutral—waiting to see which way this wind blows.\n\nBishop García de Añón of Huesca accompanies him—younger, perhaps forty-five, with the weathered look of a man who has actually visited the remote parishes of his mountainous diocese. He is said to be more pastoral than political, but no man rises to a bishopric in Aragon without understanding power.\n\nAbbot Martín de Alpartir of Veruela—head of the great Cistercian monastery that has shaped Aragonese piety for three centuries. Ancient, gaunt, his white robes hanging on a frame that seems held together by faith alone. The monasteries hold vast lands and ancient privileges; the Abbot speaks for them all.\n\nPrior Fernando de Talavera of the Dominicans in Zaragoza—a younger man, intense, with the burning certainty of the preaching orders. The Dominicans have been influential in Aragon since the days of the Albigensian Crusade; they remember when their founder walked these very streets.\n\nThey arrange themselves in your receiving chamber with the practiced ease of men accustomed to councils and audiences. Wine is offered; the Archbishop accepts, the Abbot declines, the others follow their own preferences.\n\nArchbishop Dalmau speaks first, as is his right.\n\n\"Your Majesty honors us with this summons.\" His voice is smooth, measured. \"We are, of course, eager to support the transition of the crown. The Church has always stood with legitimate authority.\"\n\nA pause. The unspoken question hangs in the air: Why have you called us here, away from the Cortes, away from the other estates?\n\nThe Archbishop's eyes flick to María, standing quietly near the window, then back to you.\n\n\"We could not help but notice Your Majesty's... concerns... regarding the registry of privileges. The Church, naturally, maintains its own archives. Our privileges derive from Rome, from councils, from papal bulls stretching back centuries. They are matters of canon law, not secular jurisdiction.\"\n\nHe folds his hands—a gesture that manages to be both humble and immovable.\n\n\"We trust Your Majesty understands the distinction.\"",

He's asking a reasonable question: what are the mutual obligations between crown and church in Aragon?\n\nThis is clever - it's the same transparency principle he applied to the nobility, but framed in a way that the clergy cannot easily refuse. He's not asking to control their documents, just to understand the relationship.\n\nThe clergy will be cautious but this is actually a reasonable request. Let me think about what the crown-church relationship in medieval Aragon would look like:\n\n1. The crown's obligations to the church:\n- Protection of church property and persons\n- Enforcement of ecclesiastical judgments in certain cases\n- Maintenance of certain royal foundations (chapels, monasteries founded by kings)\n- Possibly certain payments or endowments established by previous kings\n- Support for the faith, suppression of heresy\n- Crusade obligations\n\n2. The church's obligations to the crown:\n- Prayers for the king and royal family\n- Spiritual legitimation (coronation, blessing)\n- Possibly some financial contributions in emergencies (though clergy were often exempt)\n- Counsel and advice\n- Education of royal children?\n\nThe Archbishop will be relieved that Juan isn't trying to claim church property or demand their archives. But he'll still be cautious - any \"clarification\" of obligations could be used to expand royal claims later.\n\nLet me write the clergy's response, showing their relief but also their continued caution.\n\nThe Archbishop's expression shifts subtly—relief, quickly masked, but visible to anyone watching closely. This is not the attack on ecclesiastical privilege he had feared.\n\nHe exchanges glances with the other clergy. The Abbot's ancient eyes have sharpened with interest. Bishop García leans forward slightly. Prior Fernando's intensity has not diminished, but it has... refocused.\n\n\"A reasonable question,\" Archbishop Dalmau says slowly. \"And one that, I confess, has no simple answer.\"\n\nHe settles back in his chair, adopting the manner of a teacher—though you sense he is also buying time to think.\n\n\"The relationship between the Crown of Aragon and the Church has evolved over centuries, Your Majesty. It is not written in any single document. It is... accumulated. Like sediment in a riverbed.\"\n\nThe Abbot speaks, his voice thin but surprisingly clear.\n\n\"If I may, Your Grace.\"\n\nThe Archbishop inclines his head, deferring to age and monastic authority.\n\n\"The obligations flow in both directions, Your Majesty.\" The old Cistercian counts on skeletal fingers. \"The crown owes the Church protection—defense of ecclesiastical property, enforcement of judgments against those who harm clergy or violate sanctuary. The crown owes maintenance of royal foundations—the monasteries and chapels established by your predecessors, endowed with crown lands. The crown owes support for the faith—suppression of heresy, enforcement of tithes where secular authority is required.\"\n\nHe pauses, rheumy eyes fixed on yours.\n\n\"In return, the Church owes the crown spiritual legitimation—the coronation, the blessing of royal arms, prayers for the king's soul and the realm's prosperity. The Church owes counsel—bishops sit in the Cortes, abbots advise the throne. And in times of great necessity...\"\n\nThe Abbot trails off, glancing at the Archbishop.\n\nArchbishop Dalmau takes up the thread, more carefully now.\n\n\"In times of great necessity, the Church has contributed to the defense of the realm. Not as an obligation—the clergy are exempt from secular taxation by canon law—but as a voluntary offering. A gift. The subsidio eclesiástico, we call it. When Alfonso required funds for his Italian campaigns, the clergy of Aragon contributed. Voluntarily.\"\n\nThe emphasis on voluntarily is unmistakable.\n\n\"The amounts varied. The terms were negotiated each time. There is no fixed schedule, no established rate.\" The Archbishop spreads his hands. \"This is how it has always been done.\"\n\nBishop García clears his throat. \"There are also the tercias reales, Your Majesty—the royal third of the tithe that the crown claims in Castile. But in Aragon...\" He glances at the Archbishop.\n\n\"In Aragon, the crown's claim to the tercias is... disputed.\" The Archbishop's voice is smooth but firm. \"Some kings have collected them in some dioceses at some times. Others have not. There is no universal practice, no clear precedent. The matter has been discussed with Rome on multiple occasions without final resolution.\"\n\nPrior Fernando speaks for the first time, his voice carrying the Dominican's characteristic directness.\n\n\"Your Majesty asks what is in place. The honest answer is: a tangle of customs, precedents, agreements, and disputes stretching back three hundred years. No one document captures it. No one man understands it all.\" He fixes you with burning eyes. \"I suspect this is precisely why Your Majesty asks.\"\n\nThe other clergy shift uncomfortably. The Prior has said aloud what they were all thinking.\n\n\"You spoke today of transparency. Of a registry of privileges so that all might know what obligations exist.\" The Dominican's voice is flat, neither hostile nor friendly. \"You assured the nobility that your aim was not to dispute their rights, merely to clarify them. Now you ask us the same question.\"\n\nHe leans forward.\n\n\"So I ask Your Majesty plainly: what is your purpose? If you seek merely to understand, we can provide what records we have—though they are scattered across every diocese, every monastery, every cathedral archive in three realms. It would take years to compile them. But if you seek to establish something—to create a fixed schedule of obligations where none exists—then we must know this, so that we may consult with Rome before committing ourselves.\"\n\nThe chamber falls silent. The Archbishop looks faintly annoyed at the Prior's bluntness, but does not contradict him. The Abbot watches you with ancient, unreadable patience. Bishop García studies his hands.\n\nMaría, from her place by the window, catches your eye. Her expression says: Careful now. The Prior has forced your hand.",

The Reconquista here was completed earlier. The original purpose—funding the holy war—became... less immediate. And so, over time, the tercias in many dioceses were... retained. By the Church. For ecclesiastical purposes.\"\n\nBishop García speaks, his voice defensive. \"The funds were not wasted, Your Majesty. They built hospitals, funded poor relief, maintained churches in rural parishes that would otherwise have crumbled. The tithe was used for the faithful, as God intended.\"\n\n\"In some dioceses,\" Prior Fernando interjects coolly. \"In others, the tercias funded rather comfortable lives for cathedral canons. Or vanished into accounts that have not been audited in living memory.\"\n\n\"Brother Fernando,\" the Archbishop's voice carries a sharp warning.\n\n\"Your Majesty asked a direct question.\" The Dominican is unmoved. \"He deserves a direct answer. The tercias that should flow to the crown have been absorbed by the Church for generations. Some of it has been spent well. Some of it has been spent poorly. And some of it...\" He shrugs. \"Who can say? There are no records. Or rather, there are records that no one outside the relevant cathedral chapters has ever seen.\"\n\nThe Abbot raises one thin hand, and somehow the gesture silences everyone.\n\n\"The Prior speaks harshly, but not falsely.\" The old Cistercian's voice is calm, detached—a man who has made peace with truth long ago. \"The tercias in Aragon exist in a state of... canonical ambiguity.

If Your Majesty wishes to petition Rome for clarification, we would not oppose such a petition. Indeed, we could... assist in drafting it.

Juan's proven crusading credentials - Defensor Romaniae, Constantinople expedition\n2. The 50,000 florin donation to Dominicans - concrete proof of his generosity\n3. The Byzantine crusade provides legitimate justification for the tercias\n4. Prior Fernando's earlier comments suggest some clergy are frustrated with how tercias are used\n5. Juan has offered to write to the Pope for clarity - showing respect for ecclesiastical authority\n6. Juan's reputation for piety and genuine faith\n7. Promise of churches in new lands - expansion of Christianity\n8. The Archbishop already acknowledged the ambiguity exists\n9. Juan is about to become their king - they need a relationship with him\n \nI see significant obstacles that could derail Juan's persuasion. The Church views this proposal as a fundamental threat to its financial autonomy and sacred identity. Losing 200 years of revenue control represents an existential challenge to ecclesiastical power. Royal tax collectors entering church financial domains violates deep-seated canonical principles about sacred institutional independence. The theological argument that only sacred hands should handle sacred funds creates a profound psychological barrier beyond mere financial calculation.\n\nThe potential papal response introduces critical uncertainty. While Juan assumes Rome might be sympathetic, the clergy recognize the Pope could validate their resistance. The Archbishop's reputation and institutional pride further complicate potential agreement, as capitulation would signal institutional weakness.\n\nThe Byzantine crusade justification, while noble, seems insufficient to overcome the Church's entrenched resistance. Juan's offer appears more like a unilateral demand than a collaborative negotiation, which intensifies institutional defensiveness.\n\nA strategic response matrix emerges, mapping potential clergy reactions from complete rejection to cautious collaboration. The negotiation landscape ranges from outright resistance to nuanced compromise, with each potential outcome carrying significant institutional implications.\n\nThe clergy's primary objectives center on preserving institutional autonomy: delaying decisive action, securing external validation, and limiting royal intrusion into ecclesiastical domains. Their approach will likely involve careful procedural maneuvering rather than direct confrontation.\n\nCritically, even in scenarios of apparent agreement, underlying institutional caution remains paramount. No outcome completely eliminates the fundamental tension between royal reform ambitions and ecclesiastical self-preservation.\n\nPERSUASION ANALYSIS: Convincing the Aragonese Clergy to Accept Royal Collection of the Tercias\n\nStep 1: The Ask\n\nJuan is requesting that the Aragonese clergy:\n\nAccept royal marshals and crown tax assessors to collect the tercias (royal third of the tithe)\n\nSupport a petition to Rome clarifying that the tercias belong to the crown\n\nSurrender a revenue stream they have controlled for approximately 200 years\n\nIn exchange, Juan offers:\n\nContinued support for Church missions (50,000 florins already given to Dominicans)\n\nChurches built in the East, Africa, and new lands\n\n\"Respect and oversight from the church\" (vague)\n\nStep 2: Evaluating Juan's Approach\n\nStrengths:\n\nFrames the tercias around the Byzantine crusade—provides legitimate justification since the original grant was for holy war\n\nOffers concrete proof of generosity (50,000 florins to Dominicans)\n\nProposes writing to Rome for clarity—respects ecclesiastical hierarchy\n\nAcknowledges Church should maintain their own documents\n\nAppeals to justice and consistency (\"kings who collect in some dioceses but not others does not fit\")\n\nWeaknesses:\n\n\"Royal marshals and crown tax assessors\" is a major intrusion on ecclesiastical autonomy\n\n\"Oversight from the church\" is vague—what does this actually mean?\n\nAssumes the Pope will rule in his favor—the clergy may not share this confidence\n\nDoes not address what happens to clergy who currently depend on this revenue\n\nDoes not offer face-saving for the Archbishop who just defended the status quo\n\nStep 3: Factor Identification\n\nSuccess Factors:\n\nJuan's proven crusading credentials—Defensor Romaniae, Constantinople expedition, genuine piety\n\nThe 50,000 florin Dominican donation—concrete, recent, verifiable\n\nByzantine crusade provides legitimate theological justification for the tercias\n\nPrior Fernando's earlier comments suggest some clergy are frustrated with current misuse\n\nProposal to write to Rome shows respect for proper ecclesiastical channels\n\nPromise of Church expansion in new territories—Africa, the East\n\nJuan is about to be their king—they need a working relationship\n\nThe Archbishop already admitted the \"canonical ambiguity\" exists\n\nThe Abbot acknowledged the Prior \"speaks harshly but not falsely\"\n\nFailure Factors (weighted 2:1):\n\nMAJOR: Loss of revenue—The Church has kept these tercias for 200 years. This is an enormous material loss affecting every diocese.\n\nMAJOR: Royal officials collecting sacred revenue—Canon law holds clergy exempt from secular authority in ecclesiastical matters. Royal marshals collecting tithes violates this principle.\n\nIDENTITY: Sacred things, sacred hands—Tithes are offerings to God. Having royal tax collectors handle them feels like desecration to many clergy.\n\nPrecedent: If the king takes the tercias today, what does he take tomorrow?\n\nRome's reaction: Surrendering papal-granted rights without explicit papal approval could bring consequences\n\nFace-saving: The Archbishop just defended the current system—immediate agreement makes him appear weak or corrupt\n\nInstitutional interest: Monasteries, cathedral chapters, hospitals depend on this revenue\n\nUncertainty: Juan assumes the Pope will rule in his favor. The clergy know Rome is unpredictable.\n\nSpeed: Juan wants this now, urgently. The Church prefers centuries of delay.\n\nStep 4: Factor Balance Assessment\n\nThis request is weighted heavily toward failure factors.\n\nJuan is asking the Church to surrender two centuries of accumulated revenue and accept secular officials in ecclesiastical collection. These are major concessions. His offers—while genuine—are:\n\nFuture promises (churches in Africa/East)\n\nA single past donation (50,000 florins to one order)\n\nVague \"oversight\"\n\nThe fundamental asymmetry: Juan gains a permanent revenue stream and administrative control over Church finances. The Church gains promises and the hope that papal expansion will benefit them eventually.\n\nHowever, this is not impossible:\n\nPrior Fernando's faction exists and seems sympathetic to reform\n\nThe Archbishop has already admitted the ambiguity\n\nJuan's crusading credentials are genuine and unmatched\n\nThe Byzantine cause provides real theological cover\n\nSome clergy may prefer clarity to endless disputes\n\nExpected outcome range: Heavy resistance, with possible openings for negotiation at higher rolls. Full agreement would require exceptional rolls and would still come with significant conditions.\n\nPERSUASION TABLE: The Aragonese Clergy and the Tercias\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-10\nUnified Rejection. The Archbishop speaks for all: this is an assault on the liberties of the Church. They will oppose any petition to Rome and write their own letter warning the Pope of Juan's overreach. Prior Fernando is silenced by his superiors. The relationship between Juan and the Aragonese Church begins in open hostility.\n11-20\nFirm Resistance. The Archbishop thanks Juan for his generosity to the Dominicans but firmly refuses. The tercias are an ecclesiastical matter; royal marshals have no place in Church collection. They will not oppose a petition to Rome, but neither will they support it. The door is closed for now.\n21-30\nSkeptical Deflection. The clergy express appreciation for Juan's crusading zeal but insist this matter requires years of careful study. They propose forming a joint commission to examine the question—a commission that will meet rarely and accomplish nothing. They are buying time, hoping Juan will be distracted by other matters.\n31-40\nConditional Delay. The Archbishop agrees to write to Rome jointly with Juan—but insists the petition ask for clarification, not confirmation of royal rights. Until Rome rules, current arrangements continue unchanged. They will not accept royal collectors under any circumstances before papal guidance.\n41-50\nGrudging Engagement. The clergy acknowledge Juan's arguments have merit. They agree to support a petition to Rome and will not actively oppose reform. However, they insist that any collection must be done by Church officials, not royal marshals—perhaps with royal auditors permitted to observe but not collect. Negotiations continue.\n51-60\nNegotiated Framework. The Archbishop proposes a compromise: the Church will collect the tercias through its own officials, but will remit the royal portion to the crown with full accounting. Royal auditors may verify the accounts. This preserves ecclesiastical dignity while giving Juan transparency. Prior Fernando privately signals support for more.\n61-70\nConstructive Counter-Proposal. The clergy accept the principle that the tercias should fund the crusade. They propose a joint collection system: Church officials gather the tithe, royal and ecclesiastical auditors verify together, and the royal third flows to a dedicated crusade fund overseen by both crown and Church. This gives Juan most of what he wants while preserving clerical involvement.\n71-80\nCautious Agreement. The Archbishop, after consultation with his peers, agrees to support a petition to Rome affirming royal rights to the tercias. He accepts royal auditors in the collection process, though he requests that Church officials remain involved \"for the spiritual dignity of the tithe.\" The Abbot quietly indicates the monasteries will comply. Prior Fernando openly supports the reform.\n81-90\nGenuine Support. The clergy recognize Juan's vision. The Archbishop agrees to co-sign a strong petition to Rome and accepts a joint collection system with significant royal oversight. Prior Fernando praises Juan's commitment to the faith. The Abbot pledges monastic support. Only Bishop García expresses lingering reservations, and he will not oppose.\n91-95\nEnthusiastic Alliance. The senior clergy become active partners in reform. The Archbishop drafts the petition to Rome himself, framing it in the strongest terms. They accept royal marshals with minimal Church oversight, trusting Juan's intentions. Prior Fernando suggests this model could extend to other ecclesiastical reforms. The Church of Aragon positions itself as Juan's ally, not his obstacle.\n96-100\nTransformative Moment. Something shifts in the room. The Archbishop speaks of renewal, of a Church worthy of the crusade Juan leads. The clergy not only accept the proposal but expand it—offering to open their own archives for the registry of privileges, proposing joint oversight of ecclesiastical finances, treating this as the beginning of genuine partnership between crown and Church. Prior Fernando declares this a new era. Even the ancient Abbot speaks of hope. Juan has not merely won agreement; he has won hearts.\n\nNote on Failure Factors: Even at the highest rolls, the clergy will retain concerns about precedent, Rome's reaction, and the details of implementation. A roll of 96-100 produces enthusiasm, not naïveté. The Archbishop will still want the papal letter; the Abbot will still protect his monasteries' core interests; Prior Fernando will still watch for signs of betrayal. The failure factors persist—they are simply overcome by other considerations.\n\nRoll when ready.",

      "text": "The room is silent for a long moment after you finish speaking.\n\nPrior Fernando moves first—not with words, but with a slow nod, his burning eyes fixed on yours. The Dominican's intensity has shifted; what was suspicion has become something else. Recognition, perhaps. The look of a man who has found an unexpected ally.\n\nThe Abbot's ancient hands have stilled on the arms of his chair. He watches not you, but the Archbishop—waiting to see which way the wind blows before committing his monasteries.\n\nArchbishop Dalmau de Mur does not speak immediately. His politician's mask has cracked, and beneath it you see something you did not expect: genuine contemplation. Not calculation—contemplation. The man is actually thinking about what you have said, not merely searching for ways to deflect it.\n\n\"Fifty thousand florins to the Dominicans,\" he says finally, his voice quiet. \"Churches in the East. In Africa. In lands not yet claimed for Christ.\" He looks up. \"These are not the words of a king seeking to plunder the Church. These are the words of a king who understands that the faith must grow, not merely endure.\"\n\nHe rises, moving to the window, his back to the room.\n\n\"I have served the Church in Aragon for thirty years, Your Majesty. I have watched kings come to us with their hands out, demanding subsidies for wars that had nothing to do with God's work. Alfonso—may he rest in peace—extracted every coin he could for his Italian adventures, and what churches did he build? What missions did he fund?\" A bitter laugh. \"He promised much. He delivered little.\"\n\nThe Archbishop turns back to face you.\n\n\"You have already delivered. The Dominicans speak of your generosity as a miracle. The knights who returned from Constantinople speak of a king who prayed beside them in the shadow of the Hagia Sophia.\" His voice hardens. \"And the Turk presses ever closer to the heart of Christendom while we in Aragon squabble over who collects which coins.\"\n\nPrior Fernando speaks, his voice carrying the certainty of a man who has found his cause.\n\n\"The tercias were granted for holy war. The holy war continues—not against the Moor, but against the Ottoman. If we deny the crown these revenues now, we deny the very purpose for which they were granted.\" He looks at his fellow clergy, challenging. \"Can any of us claim that the tercias have been better spent in cathedral treasuries than they would be in defense of Constantinople?\"\n\nBishop García shifts uncomfortably but says nothing.\n\nThe Abbot stirs at last, his thin voice cutting through the tension.\n\n\"The monasteries have kept faith with our obligations. Veruela has used its portion of the tithe for the poor, for pilgrims, for the maintenance of God's house.\" He fixes you with rheumy but sharp eyes. \"If Your Majesty's marshals come to collect, I would have assurance that the monasteries are not... forgotten. That the crown remembers who has been faithful.\"\n\nIt is not opposition. It is negotiation—the ancient instinct of a man who has protected his flock for decades.\n\nArchbishop Dalmau raises his hand, and the room falls silent.\n\n\"I will support this, Your Majesty.\" The words fall like stones into still water. \"I will co-sign a petition to Rome affirming the crown's right to the tercias for the defense of Christendom. I will accept royal auditors—auditors, mind you, not collectors—working alongside Church officials to ensure honest accounting.\"\n\nHe steps closer, his voice dropping.\n\n\"But I ask three things in return. First: the petition to Rome must be framed as a clarification, not a seizure. We ask the Holy Father to confirm what has always been true, not to strip the Church of ancient rights. This protects us all.\"\n\n\"Second: the revenue must be dedicated to the crusade. Not to general treasury, not to roads or bridges or the salaries of Castilian administrators. To the crusade. Let there be a separate accounting, a sacred fund, so that all may see where God's portion goes.\"\n\n\"Third: the churches you promise—in the East, in Africa, in the new lands—let this be written. Let it be sworn. Let it be a covenant between crown and Church that outlasts us both.\"\n\nHe meets your eyes.\n\n\"Grant me these three things, and the Church of Aragon will stand with you. Not merely in this matter, but in the great work you are building. We will write to Rome together. We will open our archives to your registry. We will be your partners, not your obstacles.\"\n\nBishop García clears his throat. All eyes turn to him.\n\n\"I... do not oppose, Your Grace.\" His voice is reluctant but not hostile. \"But I would note that many parish priests depend on these revenues. If the crown takes the tercias, the burden of maintaining rural churches falls more heavily on local tithes. The common folk may suffer.\"\n\nPrior Fernando waves a dismissive hand. \"The common folk suffer now, while cathedral canons grow fat. Reform will benefit them, not harm them.\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" García says quietly. \"But let us not pretend there will be no disruption. Change always costs someone.\"\n\nThe Archbishop inclines his head, acknowledging the point.\n\n\"His Excellency speaks fairly. There will be... adjustments. Some will be painful.\" He looks at you. \"But if the alternative is a Church that hoards its treasure while Constantinople falls, then we must accept the pain.\"\n\nThe Abbot rises—slowly, painfully, his ancient bones protesting—and approaches you. He takes your hand in his, his grip surprisingly firm.\n\n\"I was a young monk when the Turks took Adrianople,\" he says softly. \"I remember the refugees who fled to Italy, to Spain, telling of horrors beyond imagining. I have prayed every day since for a king who would stand against the darkness.\"\n\nHis rheumy eyes glisten.\n\n\"I had given up hope of living to see such a king. Perhaps God has granted me this grace before I die.\"\n\nHe releases your hand and turns to the others.\n\n\"Veruela will comply. The other Cistercian houses will follow. This I pledge.\"\n\nThe room settles into a new configuration—not opposition, but alliance. The Archbishop stands ready to draft a petition. The Prior burns with reforming zeal. The Abbot has pledged his monasteries. Even the reluctant Bishop has declined to resist.\n\nMaría, watching from her place by the window, wears an expression you have never seen on her face before: wonder.",

      "text": "Then set up the scene for meeting with the city representatives.\n\nLet me recall what Camera reforms were established - from the project files, Juan worked with Pope Eugenius IV on reforming the Apostolic Camera (papal finances) during his time in Rome. This would be relevant context for the clergy.\n\nI should keep this transition relatively brief since the player indicated they want to move on to the cities. I'll show the clergy's interest in the Camera reforms and then set up the city meeting.\n\nThe tension in the room eases as the conversation shifts from negotiation to genuine discourse. Wine is poured again—the Abbot accepts a cup this time, a small sign of fellowship—and the clergy settle into their chairs with the air of men who have passed through a storm and found calm water.\n\nOn the Camera Reforms\n\nArchbishop Dalmau listens with keen interest as you describe the work begun with Pope Eugenius IV—the restructuring of papal finances, the push for transparency in the Apostolic Camera, the effort to ensure that Peter's Pence and crusade levies actually reach their intended purposes.\n\n\"We have heard rumors,\" he admits. \"Letters from Rome spoke of... tensions between the Holy Father and certain elements of the Curia who preferred the old ways. The old profitable ways.\" His lips thin. \"The Camera has been a scandal for generations. Every prince in Christendom knows that coin sent to Rome often finds its way into pockets other than those intended.\"\n\nPrior Fernando leans forward eagerly. \"Your Majesty was instrumental in these reforms?\"\n\n\"The Holy Father was receptive. The details were... negotiated.\"\n\nThe Dominican's eyes burn brighter. \"This is precisely what we Mendicants have preached for two centuries. The wealth of the Church corrupts the Church. Transparency purifies.\" He glances at the Archbishop. \"Forgive me, Your Grace, but if such reforms could be extended to every diocese, every cathedral chapter...\"\n\n\"One step at a time, Brother Fernando.\" The Archbishop's voice is dry but not hostile. \"Let us secure the tercias for the crusade before we begin reforming every treasury in Christendom.\"\n\nThe Abbot speaks, his voice thoughtful. \"The principle is the same, is it not? Whether in Rome or Zaragoza—money given for sacred purposes should reach sacred purposes. The king asks for transparency in our tercias. The Pope attempts transparency in the Camera. Perhaps this is the work of the Spirit, moving through unlikely instruments.\"\n\nHe looks at you with those ancient eyes.\n\n\"I am too old for politics, Your Majesty. But I know holiness when I see it struggling to be born.\"\n\nOn Matters of Faith\n\nThe conversation drifts to other matters—the state of the faith in Aragon, the challenge of rural parishes too poor to support proper clergy, the question of Moorish converts in Valencia and how to bring them fully into the Church.\n\nBishop García, who has been quiet since his reluctant concession, speaks more freely on pastoral matters. Here is his true concern: not cathedral politics, but the souls in remote mountain villages who see a priest once a year if they are fortunate.\n\n\"The tercias, if properly used, could fund missionary work within our own borders,\" he ventures. \"Not only churches in Africa—though those are noble—but chapels in the Pyrenees, in the valleys where people still mix Christian prayer with older practices.\"\n\nYou note this. García is not an enemy—he is a man whose priorities differ, who fears that grand crusading visions will overlook humble local needs. Such men can be allies if their concerns are acknowledged.\n\nAfter an hour of such talk—theology, administration, the practical challenges of shepherding souls—you take your leave. The clergy rise, and something has shifted. When you entered, you were a Castilian claimant seeking to extract concessions. When you leave, you are... something else. A partner, perhaps. Or at least a king they believe they can work with.\n\nArchbishop Dalmau walks you to the door himself.\n\n\"I will begin drafting the petition tonight, Your Majesty. With your permission, I will send a copy to Toledo for your seal before it goes to Rome.\"\n\nHe pauses, his voice dropping.\n\n\"The Cortes will not be as easily won. The nobles fear what you represent—a king too powerful to control. The cities fear Castilian dominance of their trade. But if you approach them as you have approached us...\"\n\nHe does not finish the sentence. He does not need to.\n\nThe City Representatives\n\nNow Juan wants to speak with the city representatives. These are the merchants and municipal officials from Barcelona, Zaragoza, Valencia, and other major cities. They have different concerns than the clergy or nobility - they care about trade, autonomy, customs duties, and not being subordinated to Castilian commercial interests.\n\nKey figures would include:\n- Representatives from Barcelona (the most important, the Catalan commercial capital)\n- Representatives from Zaragoza (the Aragonese capital)\n- Representatives from Valencia\n\nTheir concerns:\n- Preservation of municipal autonomy and chartered privileges\n- Fear that a Castilian king will favor Castilian trade interests over Aragonese/Catalan ones\n- Customs and tariffs - they collect these and don't want to lose control\n- Fear of centralization\n- Barcelona especially has strong mercantile traditions and guild power\n\nLet me set up this meeting scene and see what Juan wants to discuss with them.\n\nYou find them in a smaller chamber of the Aljafería, away from the noble factions and clerical politics. These are not men of sword or crozier—they are men of ledger and scale, of warehouse and wharf. The wealth of the Crown of Aragon flows through their hands.\n\nBerenguer de Montcada, chief of Barcelona's delegation, sits at the center. A man of perhaps fifty, with ink-stained fingers and the sharp eyes of someone who has counted every coin that passed through the greatest port in the western Mediterranean. He wears rich but sober wool—the Catalan merchant's statement that he need not dress like a noble to be wealthier than one.\n\nGuillem de Santcliment, representing Valencia, is younger and flashier—silks and a gold chain that speaks of the southern kingdom's prosperity. Valencia's trade with North Africa and Italy has made fortunes for men like him.\n\nPere de Casaldàguila speaks for Zaragoza itself—an older man, quieter, whose city lacks the great ports but controls the overland routes through Aragon. He watches more than he speaks.\n\nA dozen others fill the room—factors, guildmasters, municipal councilors—the men who actually make the Crown of Aragon function while kings chase glory in Italy.\n\nThey rise as you enter, but their bows carry a different quality than the nobles' or the clergy's. These men bend to authority, but their eyes measure you as they would measure any investment: What is he worth? What will he cost? What can he offer?\n\nBerenguer de Montcada speaks first, his Catalan formal but direct.\n\n\"Your Majesty. Barcelona welcomes the rightful heir of King Alfonso. We trust the transition of the crown will preserve the ancient liberties that have made this realm prosperous.\"\n\nIt is not quite a threat. It is not quite a greeting. It is a merchant's opening position—a statement of what he will not yield before you have even made an offer.\n\nThe others watch, waiting to see how you respond.",

      "text": "Juan is making a complex move here. He's:\n1. First establishing himself as a king who brings opportunity, not just demands - the African trade, Mali, the fleet expansion, Constantinople trade routes\n2. Then asking about trade revenues in a way that signals he's done his homework with María\n3. Positioning the question as seeking clarity rather than making demands\n\nThis is a persuasion attempt, but it's also an information-gathering moment. The merchants will respond to Juan's framing and his question about trade revenues.\n\nLet me think about how the merchants would react:\n\nThe good news Juan is offering:\n- Mali trade route (actual gold, exotic goods)\n- Expanding fleet\n- Trade routes to Constantinople\n- Wants cities to benefit\n\nThe concerning implications:\n- He's clearly building toward something about trade revenues\n- He's done his homework (\"the documents I have studied\")\n- A Castilian king talking about \"the greater trade picture\" sounds like centralization\n\nThe merchants are shrewd. They will:\n1. Be genuinely interested in the trade opportunities\n2. Be immediately wary when he pivots to the question of trade revenues\n3. Try to establish their position while not alienating the new king\n\nBerenguer de Montcada is the key figure here - Barcelona's representative. He'll be the one to respond first.\n\nLet me write this scene where:\n- The merchants show interest in the trade opportunities\n- They become wary when the revenue question comes up\n- They give an answer that acknowledges royal rights in theory while defending their practical control\n- They're measuring Juan, trying to figure out what he actually wants\n\nThis isn't a full persuasion yet - Juan hasn't made a specific ask. He's probing, gathering information, establishing context. The merchants will respond accordingly - carefully, revealing as little as possible while trying to learn what Juan is really after.\n\nThe mood in the room shifts perceptibly as you speak.\n\nWhen you mention Mali, Berenguer de Montcada's eyes sharpen. Guillem de Santcliment leans forward almost involuntarily. Even the quiet Pere de Casaldàguila tilts his head with sudden interest. These are men who have built their lives on trade routes—the mention of new ones, of gold from kingdoms beyond the known world, speaks directly to their deepest instincts.\n\n\"Mali,\" Berenguer repeats softly. \"We have heard... rumors. Genoese whispers about Portuguese ventures down the African coast. But a land route to the gold kingdoms...\"\n\n\"Not merely rumors,\" Guillem interjects, his Valencian accent coloring his Catalan. \"Your Majesty speaks of trade representatives. Actual contact with the source of Saharan gold, not merely the crumbs that reach us through Moorish middlemen in Tunis and Fez?\"\n\nYou confirm it. The merchants exchange glances—the silent communication of men who have done business together for decades. You can almost see the calculations happening behind their eyes. New routes. New goods. New fortunes.\n\nThen you pivot to the question of trade revenues, and the temperature drops.\n\nBerenguer de Montcada's expression becomes carefully neutral. Guillem settles back in his chair, the eagerness draining from his posture. Pere de Casaldàguila's watching intensifies.\n\nA long silence stretches.\n\nFinally, Berenguer speaks, choosing each word as if it were coin being counted out.\n\n\"Your Majesty asks a question that has been... discussed... for many generations.\" He steeples his ink-stained fingers. \"The answer is not simple. Perhaps it would help if I explained how matters stand in practice.\"\n\nHe glances at his fellow merchants, receiving small nods of permission.\n\n\"The crown has certain rights. This is acknowledged. The drets—the customs on foreign trade—are technically royal prerogatives. No one disputes this in principle.\" The emphasis on in principle is subtle but unmistakable. \"However, the collection of these revenues has been entrusted to the cities since... well. Since before any man in this room was born. Since before our grandfathers were born.\"\n\nGuillem takes up the thread, his voice smooth.\n\n\"Valencia, for example, maintains the port, the harbor watch, the weighmasters, the inspectors who ensure that goods are what merchants claim them to be. These services cost money. The city's share of the customs—a customary share, established by long practice—funds these essential functions. Without them, trade could not flow. Ships would not dock. Merchants would take their business to Genoa or Marseille.\"\n\n\"The same is true in Barcelona,\" Berenguer adds. \"Our share is not... appropriation. It is compensation for services rendered to the crown. We collect on the crown's behalf, maintain the infrastructure that makes collection possible, and remit the royal portion faithfully.\"\n\nPere de Casaldàguila speaks for the first time, his voice dry as old parchment.\n\n\"Your Majesty mentions documents. May I ask which documents?\"\n\nThere is an edge beneath the question. The merchants are trying to determine how much you actually know—whether you have seen specific charters, specific grants, specific arrangements that might be challenged.\n\nBerenguer raises a hand, forestalling any tension.\n\n\"What my colleague means, Your Majesty, is that the arrangements vary. Each city has its own history, its own charters, its own customs. Barcelona's relationship with the crown is not Valencia's. Valencia's is not Zaragoza's.\" He spreads his hands. \"There is no single document that captures all of it. The system has grown organically, over centuries, adapting to circumstances.\"\n\nOrganically. The word hangs in the air. What it means, you understand, is: without clear records that might allow a king to challenge us.\n\nGuillem leans forward again, his tone shifting to something more conciliatory.\n\n\"Your Majesty speaks of expanding trade. Of fleets. Of routes to Africa and Constantinople. These are... exciting prospects. Valencia has long dreamed of deeper trade with the East. If the Ottoman threat could be managed, if the seas were safer...\"\n\nHe trails off, letting the implication settle.\n\n\"The cities of Aragon are not the crown's enemies, Your Majesty. We are its partners. Our prosperity is the crown's prosperity—through customs, through subsidies granted by the Cortes, through the wealth that trade brings to the realm.\" He pauses. \"But partnership requires trust. And trust requires... clarity about intentions.\"\n\nBerenguer nods slowly.\n\n\"Your Majesty has asked whether the crown has the right to collect trade revenues. The honest answer is: yes, the crown has rights. But the cities also have rights—chartered privileges, long-established customs, arrangements that have functioned for generations.\" His merchant's eyes meet yours directly. \"Perhaps the more useful question is not who has rights, but how we can work together to ensure that trade flourishes, that the crown receives its due, and that the cities retain the means to maintain the ports and infrastructure that make it all possible.\"\n\nHe pauses, then adds carefully:\n\n\"Your Majesty mentioned wanting the cities to benefit from these new ventures. We would be very interested to hear more about what that might look like. Specifically.\"\n\nThe room waits. The merchants have made their position clear: they acknowledge royal rights in theory while defending their practical control. They are not hostile—but they are wary, and they want to know what you actually want before committing to anything.",

These discoveries are not mine alone, they are also because of Portugal that these advances have been made. I have provided the coin for an enourmously expensive expedition and supplied the men and ships and the Portugese their experience. None could have happened if we operated independantly.\n\n\nI fully want the cities of Aragon to benefit and profit from these discoveries as well. But there should be just mechanics for the crown to not only recoup it's investment but to fund future expeditions as well. These things Aragon could never do alone, even if it had the coin to fund an expedition, it does not have the ports or the experience to do so.\n\n\nNow that we are uniting Iberia and we discover these new markets, I would like the same principles to apply to the tariffs as they are applied in Castille and Byzantium as well. I want to establish the mercantile courts who operate under the same lex mercantile, the same incorruptible harbour masters and tax collectors. I will ensure the taxes owed will be collected fairly. And this will increase the amount of trade that passes through the ports greatly. As far as I am concerned, this is not unreasonable and reflects what the crown is due anyway. If there are ancient fuereos that have been granted specifically to cities by the crown, I will hear them so we can codify them as well.\n\n\nThe result of all these measures will increase trade. I hope you see the benefit in this because if the cities benefit from these discoveries without any form of contribution, I will have to balance these scales in other ways.\n\n\nThis is a persuasion.

      "text": "### Step 1: The Ask\n\nJuan is requesting:\n1. Standardized mercantile courts operating under lex mercatoria across all his realms\n2. Royal (not city) harbor masters and tax collectors\n3. Uniform tariff principles applied across Castile, Aragon, and Byzantine territories\n4. Cities to produce their charters/fueros for registration\n5. Implicit threat: contribute or face \"balancing scales in other ways\"\n\nThis is a MAJOR ask. He's essentially proposing to strip the cities of their most valuable privilege - control over their own ports and customs collection.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluating Juan's Approach\n\n**Strengths:**\n- Opens with concrete proof of success (Mali expedition, Portugal partnership)\n- Frames it as partnership, not extraction\n- Emphasizes mutual benefit - cities will profit from new trade routes\n- Offers access to African and Eastern markets they couldn't reach alone\n- Proposes \"incorruptible\" officials - implies current system is corrupt (dangerous but potentially appealing to some)\n- Frames standardization as beneficial for trade\n- Appeals to justice and fairness\n- Offers to hear and codify legitimate privileges\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- \"Royal harbor masters and tax collectors\" is a MASSIVE intrusion - this is the core of city autonomy\n- The veiled threat at the end (\"balance scales in other ways\") may antagonize\n- Comparing Aragon to Castile and Byzantium - implies treating them as provinces, not partners\n- \"Incorruptible\" officials implies current city officials ARE corrupt - insulting\n\n- No concrete offer of what cities KEEP - only what they lose\n- No face-saving mechanism for the established order\n- Speed - he wants this now, merchants prefer gradual change\n- Doesn't address the practical question: who pays for port infrastructure if cities lose customs revenue?\n\nI see critical gaps in Juan's persuasion strategy. The proposal lacks a clear compensation mechanism for cities losing their economic autonomy. While promising exciting trade routes through Mali and Constantinople, he fails to provide a compelling financial alternative to the customs revenues cities would surrender. The approach feels more like a royal decree than a negotiated partnership, which could provoke significant resistance from merchant elites who value their historical privileges.\n\nThe success factors are promising - safer seas, unified legal systems, and reduced transaction costs could genuinely appeal to merchants. However, the failure factors are profound. Losing 200 years of port control represents an existential threat to city economic sovereignty. Juan must offer a concrete financial replacement and a face-saving transition strategy to overcome this fundamental challenge.\n\nBarcelona's pride and identity are deeply wounded by Castilian demands. The threat of losing municipal autonomy, combined with potential Castilian officials replacing local administrators, creates a defensive posture. Merchants prefer incremental change and negotiation, not sudden imperial decrees.\n\nThe power dynamics are complex. Juan's implicit threat might backfire, pushing cities into collective resistance rather than cooperation. His proposal fundamentally challenges their economic and political independence, making negotiation extremely delicate.\n\nThe factor balance heavily tilts toward failure, suggesting Juan needs a dramatically more nuanced approach to convince these Mediterranean trading powers to surrender their centuries-old economic privileges.\n\nPERSUASION ANALYSIS: Convincing the Aragonese Cities to Accept Royal Trade Administration\n\nStep 1: The Ask\n\nJuan is requesting that the merchant cities:\n\nAccept standardized mercantile courts under a unified lex mercatoria across all his realms\n\nAccept royal harbor masters and tax collectors replacing city-controlled officials\n\nApply the same tariff principles used in Castile and Byzantium\n\nProduce their chartered privileges for registration and codification\n\nAcknowledge the crown's right to collect trade revenues directly\n\nIn exchange, Juan offers:\n\nAccess to the Mali gold trade and African markets\n\nAccess to Eastern trade routes through Constantinople\n\nExpanded royal fleet making seas safer\n\nUnified legal system reducing cross-border transaction costs\n\nFair and \"incorruptible\" collection\n\nThere is also an implicit threat: \"If the cities benefit from these discoveries without any form of contribution, I will have to balance these scales in other ways.\"\n\nStep 2: Evaluating Juan's Approach\n\nStrengths:\n\nOpens with concrete proof of success—the Mali expedition is real, the gold is flowing\n\nFrames the proposal as partnership, emphasizing mutual benefit\n\nCorrectly notes that Aragon alone lacks the ports, experience, and capital for such ventures\n\nOffers access to markets the cities cannot reach independently\n\nUnified lex mercatoria genuinely benefits merchants trading across multiple realms\n\nProposes to hear and codify legitimate privileges—not simply abolish them\n\nAppeals to justice and fairness\n\nWeaknesses:\n\n\"Royal harbor masters and tax collectors\" is an enormous intrusion—this strikes at the heart of city autonomy\n\nThe veiled threat at the end will antagonize rather than persuade\n\nComparing Aragon to Castile and Byzantium implies treating the cities as provinces, not partners\n\n\"Incorruptible\" officials implies the current city officials are corrupt—insulting to men who have built their careers on these systems\n\nDoes not address who pays for port infrastructure if cities lose their customs share\n\nNo concrete offer of what cities retain—only what they surrender\n\nNo face-saving mechanism for the established order\n\nMerchants prefer gradual change and tested arrangements; Juan wants this now\n\nStep 3: Factor Identification\n\nSuccess Factors:\n\nMali gold trade—genuinely exciting; access to the source of Saharan gold could transform fortunes\n\nEastern trade routes through Constantinople—if Ottoman threat is managed, this is valuable\n\nExpanded royal fleet means safer seas, more trade volume, lower insurance costs\n\nUnified lex mercatoria reduces transaction costs for merchants operating across realms\n\nStandardization could eliminate inconsistencies that currently create arbitrage and disputes\n\nJuan's proven track record—Granada, Constantinople, the Mali expedition—demonstrates competence\n\nJuan is about to be their king; they need a working relationship\n\nSome merchants may genuinely suffer under current corruption and welcome reform\n\nThe implicit threat carries weight—Juan is powerful, and defiance has costs\n\nFailure Factors (weighted 2:1):\n\nCRITICAL: Loss of port control—Cities have controlled customs collection for over 200 years. This is their core economic and political power. Royal officials replacing city officials represents a fundamental transfer of sovereignty.\n\nCRITICAL: Financial devastation—The \"customary share\" of customs funds everything: port maintenance, harbor watch, city guards, public works. Losing this revenue cripples municipal government.\n\nInfrastructure crisis—Who maintains ports, harbors, warehouses, weighing houses if cities lose customs revenue? Juan has not addressed this.\n\nIdentity and pride—Barcelona sees itself as the greatest trading city in the western Mediterranean, not a Castilian province. Being told to adopt \"Castilian principles\" is deeply humiliating.\n\nPrecedent—If they yield on customs today, what comes tomorrow? Municipal taxes? Self-governance? The fueros themselves?\n\nThe threat backfires—\"Balance scales in other ways\" makes merchants defensive, not cooperative. They will unite against coercion.\n\nImplied insult—\"Incorruptible officials\" suggests current city officials are corrupt. These are the fathers, brothers, and sons of the men in this room.\n\nCastilian officials?—Will these royal tax collectors be Castilians? The fueros require Aragonese officials in Aragonese offices. Juan has not addressed this.\n\nSpeed and uncertainty—Merchants prefer gradual change, pilot programs, tested arrangements. Juan wants sweeping reform now.\n\nTrust deficit—They do not know Juan. Alfonso was predictable; a Castilian king who speaks of \"Castilian principles\" is an unknown quantity.\n\nCollective solidarity—Even if one city might benefit, they will not break ranks. Merchants protect merchants.\n\nDiputació involvement—Major changes to trade administration typically require Cortes approval. The cities have allies in that body.\n\nStep 4: Factor Balance Assessment\n\nThis request is very heavily weighted toward failure factors.\n\nJuan is asking for something enormous: effective royal takeover of port administration and customs collection that cities have controlled for two centuries. His offers, while genuine, are:\n\nFuture access to new trade routes (speculative)\n\nUnified legal system (beneficial but abstract)\n\nImplicit threat (coercive, not persuasive)\n\nWhat he is NOT offering:\n\nCompensation for lost customs revenue\n\nGuarantee that cities retain funding for port infrastructure\n\nAssurance that officials will be Aragonese, not Castilian\n\nA meaningful role for cities in the new system\n\nFace-saving for the current establishment\n\nTime to adjust and negotiate terms\n\nThe threat at the end is particularly damaging. Merchants respond to incentives, not coercion. A threat unites them against the threatener.\n\nThis is harder than the clergy negotiation. The Archbishop could accept transparency and joint collection while retaining ecclesiastical dignity. The merchants are being asked to surrender the machinery of their prosperity with no clear compensation.\n\nExpected outcome: Strong resistance. At lower rolls, outright refusal and united opposition. At middle rolls, counter-proposals that try to preserve city control. Only at the highest rolls will there be genuine openness—and even then, the cities will demand substantial concessions in return.\n\nPERSUASION TABLE: The Aragonese Cities and Royal Trade Administration\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-10\nUnited Rejection. Berenguer de Montcada speaks for all: Barcelona will not surrender its ancient liberties to Castilian tax collectors, and the threat to \"balance scales\" has been noted. The cities will oppose any such measure in the Cortes, and they will write to their counterparts in Valencia and Zaragoza urging unified resistance. The meeting ends coldly. Juan has made enemies of the merchant class before his coronation.\n11-20\nHostile Counter-Unity. The merchants reject the proposal with barely concealed anger. Guillem of Valencia points out that the fueros require Aragonese officials in Aragonese ports—royal collectors would violate charter. Pere of Zaragoza notes that threats are not negotiations. They will not obstruct Juan's coronation, but they will grant nothing beyond what law requires. The cities close ranks.\n21-30\nPolite Stonewalling. The merchants thank Juan for his vision but insist that such sweeping changes require years of study, consultation with guild masters, review of ancient charters. They propose forming a commission—one that will meet rarely and recommend nothing. They are buying time, hoping Juan will be distracted by Naples or Constantinople. No door is opened.\n31-40\nDefensive Counter-Proposal. Berenguer acknowledges the Mali opportunity but proposes an alternative: the cities will fund a trade mission to Africa themselves, under city control, sharing profits with the crown. This preserves city autonomy while giving Juan something. Royal officials in their ports remain unacceptable. They are offering a bribe to make him go away.\n41-50\nGrudging Engagement on Limited Terms. The merchants accept the value of unified lex mercatoria and would welcome mercantile courts with standardized procedures. They might accept royal auditors observing city collection—but not royal collectors replacing city officials. They want the new trade routes but will not pay the price Juan asks. Negotiation is possible, but Juan must lower his demands significantly.\n51-60\nConditional Negotiation. Guillem proposes a framework: cities retain collection but accept royal auditors and standardized accounting. A fixed percentage—to be negotiated—flows to a dedicated \"exploration fund\" supporting new ventures. In exchange, Aragonese merchants receive preferential access to African and Eastern routes. They are interested but protecting their core interests fiercely.\n61-70\nConstructive Counter-Offer. Berenguer, speaking carefully, acknowledges that the current system has... inefficiencies. He proposes joint administration: city officials collect alongside royal auditors, with transparent accounting shared between crown and municipality. Cities retain infrastructure funding; crown receives a guaranteed share for expeditions. Access to new routes is formalized in charter. This gives Juan much of what he wants while preserving city dignity.\n71-80\nSerious Engagement. The merchants caucus briefly, then return with a substantive proposal. They will accept royal oversight of customs collection—not replacement of city officials, but genuine oversight with teeth. They will contribute to exploration funding through a dedicated levy. They will open their records for the registry. In exchange: guaranteed Aragonese officials, infrastructure funding preserved, formal access to all new trade routes, and seats on any body governing Mediterranean commerce. They are negotiating seriously.\n81-90\nNear-Acceptance with Conditions. Berenguer admits that fragmented systems serve no one well. Barcelona will accept standardized collection under royal authority—if the collectors are Catalan, if infrastructure funding is guaranteed, if the cities retain meaningful voice in trade policy. Guillem and Pere signal agreement. They want this to work but need assurances. The deal is close; details must be negotiated, but the principle is accepted.\n91-95\nEnthusiastic Partnership. Something shifts. The merchants see not a threat but an opportunity—unified Iberian trade policy, access to African gold at the source, Eastern routes through Constantinople, a king who understands commerce. Berenguer proposes going further: a formal Consolat de Mar spanning all of Juan's realms, with Barcelona as its seat. They will accept royal administration if they can help shape it. They want in.\n96-100\nTransformative Alliance. The merchants do not merely accept—they embrace. Berenguer speaks of a new era, a Mediterranean trading empire to rival Venice and Genoa. They offer to help design the unified system, to fund the exploration fleet, to open Barcelona's shipyards to royal service. They see Juan not as a threat to their prosperity but as its greatest opportunity. The cities of Aragon become not reluctant subjects but eager partners in the enterprise.\n\nNote on Failure Factors: Even at the highest rolls, the merchants will retain concerns about Castilian dominance, infrastructure funding, and the details of implementation. A roll of 96-100 produces enthusiasm, not naïveté. Berenguer will still insist on Catalan officials; Guillem will still want Valencia's interests protected; Pere will still ensure Zaragoza is not forgotten. The failure factors persist—they are simply overcome by the weight of opportunity.\n\nRoll when ready.",

The calculation behind their eyes shifts from what can we gain to how do we survive this.\n\nBerenguer de Montcada's expression hardens. The ink-stained fingers that were steepled in consideration now flatten against the table, a man bracing himself.\n\nGuillem de Santcliment's flash of silk and gold suddenly seems less like prosperity and more like armor. His easy Valencian charm has vanished entirely.\n\nEven quiet Pere de Casaldàguila straightens in his chair, and when he speaks, his voice carries an edge you have not heard before.\n\n\"Your Majesty speaks of incorruptible harbor masters and tax collectors.\" The word drips with ice. \"May I ask—are the current officials of Zaragoza corrupt, in Your Majesty's view? My brother has served as portmaster for fifteen years. My nephew oversees the weighing house. Should I inform them that the King of Castile considers them thieves?\"\n\n\"The King of Aragon,\" Berenguer interjects, his voice flat. \"If His Majesty intends to claim that crown. Though one might wonder, hearing these proposals, whether His Majesty understands the difference.\"\n\nGuillem rises from his chair—not in deference, but in agitation. He paces to the window, then turns back, his voice tight with controlled anger.\n\n\"Your Majesty proposes to apply Castilian principles to Aragonese ports. To install royal officials—Castilian officials, presumably, since Your Majesty's administration is Castilian—in Barcelona, in Valencia, in every harbor of the realm.\" He shakes his head. \"Has Your Majesty read the fueros? Article 61: Offices in each realm shall be held by natives of that realm. A Castilian may not hold office in Aragon.\"\n\nHe spreads his hands.\n\n\"This is not custom, Your Majesty. This is law. The same law you have promised to swear to uphold tomorrow. And before the oath is even spoken, you propose to violate it.\"\n\nBerenguer de Montcada speaks now, and his voice carries the weight of a man who has negotiated with kings before and knows his worth.\n\n\"Your Majesty mentions that if the cities benefit without contribution, you will balance the scales in other ways.\" He pauses, letting the words hang in the air. \"We have noted this. We will remember it.\"\n\nHe glances at his fellow merchants, receiving small nods.\n\n\"Barcelona has contributed to the crown for three hundred years. We have funded wars, paid subsidies, built the fleets that carry Aragonese trade across the Mediterranean. When Alfonso needed money for Naples, we gave it—through the Cortes, through proper channels, in exchange for proper recognition of our liberties.\" His voice hardens. \"We are not beggars seeking scraps from the Castilian table. We are the merchants who made the Crown of Aragon wealthy. And we do not respond well to threats.\"\n\nPere de Casaldàguila rises slowly.\n\n\"Your Majesty speaks of Mali, of gold, of new routes to Africa and the East. These are fine words. But Zaragoza has heard fine words from kings before.\" His dry voice carries centuries of Aragonese skepticism. \"King Alfonso spoke of how Naples would enrich us all. We funded his wars for twenty years. What did Zaragoza receive? Debts. Taxes. Young men who never came home.\"\n\nHe gestures toward the window, toward the city beyond.\n\n\"The cities of Aragon have learned to be cautious with royal promises. We will believe in African gold when we see it weighed in our markets. Until then, we prefer to keep what we have rather than surrender it for dreams.\"\n\nBerenguer stands, and the other merchants rise with him—a unified front, deliberate and unmistakable.\n\n\"Your Majesty. We will not oppose your coronation. The succession is lawful, and Barcelona honors lawful succession.\" His voice is formal now, diplomatic, but utterly closed. \"We will fulfill our legal obligations to the crown—nothing less, nothing more.\"\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\"But we will not surrender the administration of our ports to royal officials. We will not accept Castilian—or any foreign—tax collectors in Aragonese harbors. We will not open our charter privileges for codification by a king who has just threatened to balance scales against us if we do not comply.\"\n\nGuillem adds, his voice sharp: \"If Your Majesty wishes to discuss trade opportunities—genuine partnerships, mutual benefit, proper respect for the fueros—we remain willing to listen. But this?\" He gestures at the air between you. \"This was not a negotiation. This was a demand dressed in velvet. And Barcelona does not yield to demands.\"\n\nThe merchants bow—correct, formal, shallow—and move toward the door.\n\nBerenguer pauses at the threshold, turning back.\n\n\"Your Majesty will find that the Cortes of Aragon is not the Cortes of Castile. The cities have voices there. Strong voices. If Your Majesty attempts to impose these measures without our consent...\"\n\nHe does not finish the sentence. He does not need to.\n\nThe door closes behind them.\n\nThe chamber is silent.\n\nMaría, who has been watching from her customary place near the window, exhales slowly.\n\n\"That,\" she says quietly, \"could have gone better.\"",

The apology and clarification will land differently with different merchants - some might soften, others might remain hostile. The key is that Juan has shown willingness to listen and correct course.\n\nThe merchants pause.\n\nBerenguer's hand is on the door, but he has not opened it. Guillem has turned, his sharp eyes reassessing. Pere de Casaldàguila, who was closest to leaving, stands frozen mid-step.\n\nYour words hang in the air—the apology, the clarification, the open hand where a moment ago there was a fist.\n\nSilence stretches.\n\nBerenguer de Montcada releases the door handle.

Merchants understand balancing scales. It is what we do.\"\n\nBerenguer moves back toward the table—not sitting, not yet, but no longer fleeing.\n\n\"Your Majesty's interpretation of the fueros is not... unreasonable, in the abstract.\" Each word is chosen carefully, a man rebuilding a bridge he nearly burned. \"The crown does have rights to customs revenues. This is acknowledged. The means of collection is where the complexity lies.\"\n\nHe glances at his fellow merchants.\n\n\"The fueros do not say only locals may collect. They say offices must be held by natives of the realm. A harbor master appointed by the crown who is Catalan, Valencian, Aragonese—this does not violate Article 61. A harbor master appointed by the crown who is Castilian...\" He shrugs. \"That is different.\"\n\nGuillem steps forward, his earlier anger cooling into something more analytical.\n\n\"Your Majesty says the cities have not contributed to this specific venture—the African expeditions, the Mali trade. This is true.\" He raises a finger. \"But neither were we invited to contribute. The venture was Castilian and Portuguese. Aragonese merchants were not approached, not consulted, not offered shares in the enterprise.\"\n\nHe spreads his hands.\n\n\"If Your Majesty wishes Aragonese contribution to future ventures, perhaps Aragonese merchants should be partners in those ventures—not subjects presented with accomplished facts and asked to pay for access to profits they had no hand in creating.\"\n\nPere de Casaldàguila settles slowly back into his chair—a signal that the conversation is not over.\n\n\"Your Majesty asks for proposals. For ideas on how to make this fair.\" His ancient eyes study you. \"This is... a different posture than we heard a moment ago. A posture we can work with.\"\n\nHe looks to Berenguer, deferring to Barcelona's primacy.\n\nBerenguer remains standing, but his stance has shifted—no longer defensive, now contemplative.\n\n\"If Your Majesty is genuinely open to proposals...\" He pauses, weighing his words. \"Then perhaps we can speak as men of business rather than as subjects and sovereign.\"\n\nHe finally sits, and the other merchants follow—a subtle signal that the negotiation has reopened.\n\n\"The cities have concerns. Legitimate concerns, rooted in centuries of experience with kings who promised much and delivered little.\" Berenguer's voice is calm now, direct. \"Address those concerns, and you may find us more flexible than we appeared a moment ago.\"\n\nHe counts on ink-stained fingers.\n\n\"First: local officials. Your Majesty has acknowledged this. Any reform must use Aragonese, Catalan, or Valencian men in Aragonese, Catalan, or Valencian ports. This is not negotiable—it is law.\"\n\n\"Second: infrastructure. The cities currently fund port maintenance, harbor watch, weighing houses, and all the machinery of trade from our share of customs. If the crown takes a larger share, who pays for these essential services? Ships do not dock at harbors that are not maintained.\"\n\n\"Third: participation, not subjugation. If there are new ventures—African trade, Eastern routes, whatever opportunities Your Majesty's vision creates—the cities wish to be partners. We have capital. We have ships. We have expertise. We do not wish merely to pay for access to profits others control.\"\n\nHe pauses, then adds more quietly:\n\n\"Fourth: trust. We do not know Your Majesty. Alfonso we understood—his flaws, his virtues, his predictable appetites. A Castilian king who speaks of Castilian principles and Castilian methods makes us... wary. We need to see, over time, that Aragonese interests matter to you as much as Castilian ones.\"\n\nGuillem leans forward.\n\n\"Your Majesty asked for proposals. Here is one.\"\n\nHe glances at his colleagues, receiving small nods.\n\n\"The cities will contribute to future exploration ventures—as investors, with shares proportional to our investment, participating in profits and losses alike. We will accept standardized accounting and royal auditors verifying that customs are honestly reported and fairly shared. We will even discuss adjustments to the crown's share, if such adjustments come with guaranteed access to new markets.\"\n\nHe raises a finger.\n\n\"But we will not accept royal officials replacing city officials. We will not accept Castilian administrators in Aragonese ports. And we will not accept being told how much to contribute without being consulted about what we receive in return.\"\n\nPere de Casaldàguila nods slowly.\n\n\"This is the Aragonese way, Your Majesty. We bargain. We negotiate. We find arrangements that serve all parties.\" His dry voice carries a hint of something that might be warmth. \"It is slower than royal decree. It is messier than Castilian absolutism. But it is how the Crown of Aragon has functioned for three centuries.\"\n\nHe meets your eyes.\n\n\"Can Your Majesty work within such a system? Or does Your Majesty require submission rather than partnership?\"\n\nThe question hangs in the air—not hostile, but pointed. The merchants have reopened the door.

The nobles are the ones who will be doing the \"hard bargaining\" based on the earlier roll of 29 for Aragon accepting Juan's claim.\n\nLet me think about who the key noble figures are:\n- Don Martín Díez de Aux - the Justicia\n- Don Juan de Híjar - head of a great noble house, was hostile about the registry idea\n- Don Bernat de Centelles - Alfonso's ambassador, seemed sympathetic to Juan\n- Don Felipe de Castro - family claims descent from old counts of Urgell, potentially hostile\n- The Archbishop of Zaragoza - clergy, but also present in the Cortes\n\nI should bring in a delegation of the key noble figures.

I'll have the nobles gather and present their concerns/demands.\n\nBerenguer de Montcada inclines his head—not warmth, not yet, but acknowledgment. The door that was closing has reopened.\n\n\"We will await Your Majesty's further thoughts,\" he says. \"The cities remain willing to discuss arrangements that serve all parties.\"\n\nThe merchants depart—not in anger this time, but in the cautious posture of men who have stepped back from a precipice and are still finding their footing.

Barely.\" She shakes her head. \"The apology saved you. Alfonso would never have apologized—he would have doubled down and made enemies for a generation. You...\" She pauses. \"You listened. They did not expect that.\"\n\nShe moves to the side table, pouring wine for herself without asking if you want any.\n\n\"The nobles will be harder in some ways, easier in others. They care less about customs revenues and more about power, precedence, and the fear that a Castilian king means Castilian dominance.\" She drinks. \"They have been meeting among themselves since your speech about the registry of privileges. The factions are... active.\"\n\nThe Aljafería Palace — An Hour Later\n\nWord is sent, and the noble delegation assembles in the same chamber where you met the clergy. But where the churchmen came with theological concerns and the merchants with commercial calculations, these men carry something older and more dangerous: pride.\n\nDon Juan de Híjar enters first—the man who shouted about \"Castilian tricks\" in the Cortes. He is perhaps fifty, broad-shouldered, with the weathered face of a man who has fought in more than one campaign. His family has held lands in Aragon since the Reconquista; he looks at you as a man looks at an intruder in his home.\n\nDon Felipe de Castro follows—smoother, younger, more dangerous. His family's claim to the county of Urgell was set aside when Alfonso's father took the throne; they have never forgotten, never forgiven. He wears his courtesy like a blade sheathed in silk.\n\nDon Bernat de Centelles enters third, and his presence is a relief. Alfonso's old ambassador, the man who accompanied you to Rome years ago, the one who spoke in favor of the registry. He catches your eye and gives an almost imperceptible nod—but he does not sit near you. He cannot appear to be the king's man, not yet.\n\nDon Lope Ximénez de Urrea, head of one of the oldest families in Aragon, settles into a chair with the slow deliberation of age and dignity. He has not spoken publicly for or against you; he is here to listen, to judge.\n\nDon Pedro de Luna, distant kinsman of the infamous antipope Benedict XIII, represents the Aragonese nobility's connection to the great ecclesiastical politics of the last generation. His family's loyalty to the schismatic pope cost them much; they have been rebuilding ever since.\n\nA half-dozen others fill the room—lesser lords, heads of cadet branches, men who will follow where the great families lead. They watch you with the careful attention of wolves assessing a new presence in their territory.\n\nDon Juan de Híjar speaks first. He does not wait for permission.\n\n\"Your Majesty summoned us. We have come.\" His voice is flat, neither hostile nor welcoming. \"We have been discussing your... proposals. The registry of privileges. The implications for Aragonese liberties.\"\n\nHe glances at his fellow nobles.\n\n\"We have concerns.\"\n\nDon Felipe de Castro smiles—a pleasant expression that does not reach his eyes.\n\n\"What my lord of Híjar means, Your Majesty, is that the nobility of Aragon wishes to understand your intentions. You have spoken of transparency, of clarity, of knowing what obligations exist.\" He spreads his hands. \"These are fine words. But words can mean many things. A registry of privileges could be a tool for protecting ancient rights—or a tool for identifying which rights to eliminate.\"\n\nDon Lope Ximénez de Urrea stirs in his chair.\n\n\"The old families remember what happened in Castile, Your Majesty. How John I broke the power of the grandes. How your own father—God rest him—played the nobility against each other until none could stand against the crown.\" His voice is thin with age but sharp with memory. \"We do not wish to see Aragonese liberties suffer the same fate.\"\n\nDon Bernat de Centelles clears his throat.\n\n\"Perhaps, my lords, we should allow His Majesty to speak before we voice our concerns.\" He looks at you. \"Your Majesty has shown today that he is willing to listen—to the clergy, to the merchants. The nobility would hear what accommodation the crown proposes for our... particular situation.\"\n\nThe room falls silent.\n\nDon Juan de Híjar's arms are crossed. Don Felipe's smile remains fixed. Don Lope watches with ancient, weighing eyes. The others wait to see which way the wind blows.\n\nThe floor is yours.",

      "text": "Juan has flipped the conversation. Instead of defending himself or explaining his intentions regarding the registry of privileges, he's asking the nobles directly what *they* intend to contribute to the crusade effort. This is a clever move—it puts them on the defensive and forces them to articulate their position on military obligations, which María earlier explained are vague and uncodified in Aragon.\n\nThis is not yet a persuasion attempt. Juan is asking a question, gathering information, and putting the nobles in a position where they must respond. The GM should have the nobles react to this question—some may be evasive, some may be hostile, some may see an opportunity.\n\nLet me think about how each noble might respond:\n\n1. **Don Juan de Híjar** - He's the hostile one, the one who shouted about \"Castilian tricks.\" He'll probably be defensive, might try to deflect the question or point out that Aragon has its own concerns.\n\n2. **Don Felipe de Castro** - Smooth and dangerous, from the Urgell line that was passed over for the throne. He'll probably try to turn the question back on Juan, perhaps questioning whether this crusade is really Aragon's fight.\n\n3. **Don Bernat de Centelles** - The friendly one, Alfonso's ambassador. He might try to give a more constructive response, perhaps pointing out what Aragon *has* contributed historically.\n\n4. **Don Lope Ximénez de Urrea** - Old, cautious, watching. He might give a measured response about traditional obligations.\n\n5. **Don Pedro de Luna** - Connected to the antipope. Might have thoughts on Church-related matters.\n\nThe key dynamic here is that Juan has just learned from María that:\n- There is NO fixed military obligation in the fueros\n- Nobles serve voluntarily, in exchange for concessions\n- Alfonso had to beg for troops for Naples\n- The system depends on negotiation, not command\n\nSo Juan's question is actually quite pointed—he's asking them to articulate what they will do, knowing that they have no legal obligation to do anything.\n \nI anticipate the nobles will strategically navigate this request. They'll likely affirm the crusade's noble purpose while carefully avoiding concrete commitments. Each noble will aim to protect their interests, balancing political appearances with personal advantages. Their responses will reveal the complex negotiation dynamics of Aragonese nobility, where support is always conditional and strategic.\n\nThe question lands like a stone thrown into a still pond.\n\nThe nobles exchange glances. You have not defended yourself, not explained your intentions, not reassured them about their privileges. You have simply asked what they intend to do.\n\nDon Juan de Híjar's crossed arms tighten. Don Felipe de Castro's smile flickers, just for an instant, before resettling into its careful shape. Don Lope Ximénez de Urrea's ancient eyes narrow with something that might be reassessment.\n\nThe silence stretches.\n\nDon Felipe de Castro speaks first, his voice smooth as oiled silk.\n\n\"Your Majesty poses an interesting question. The conflict in the East is indeed grave—all Christendom knows of the Ottoman threat, of Constantinople's peril.\" He spreads his hands in an elegant gesture. \"But Aragon has its own concerns. The Mediterranean trade that sustains our prosperity. The rivalry with Genoa. The eternal question of Sardinia and Corsica. The... complexities of Naples, which consumed my late lord Alfonso's reign.\"\n\nHe pauses, choosing his next words with care.\n\n\"The nobility of Aragon has always supported the defense of Christendom. We sent knights to the Crusades when Jerusalem still stood. We fought the Moor alongside Castile for generations.\" His smile sharpens. \"But support, Your Majesty, has always been... negotiated. The Cortes grants subsidies. Individual lords contribute according to their means and their enthusiasm for the cause. This is our way.\"\n\nDon Juan de Híjar cuts in, less polished but more direct.\n\n\"What my lord of Castro means is that Aragonese nobles are not Castilian nobles. We do not march when the king commands. We march when we are persuaded that marching serves Aragon's interests—and our own.\"\n\nHe uncrosses his arms, leaning forward.\n\n\"Your Majesty has conquered Granada. Your Majesty has sailed to Constantinople. Your Majesty has won glory enough for any three kings.\" His voice carries a rough edge. \"But these were Castilian ventures, funded by Castilian coin, fought by Castilian knights. Aragon contributed little because Aragon was not asked—and because Alfonso had his own wars to fight.\"\n\nHe gestures at the room.\n\n\"Now you come to us speaking of obligations. Of how we intend to support your crusade. But what is Aragon's stake in Constantinople? What do we gain if the city holds? What do we lose if it falls?\"\n\nDon Lope Ximénez de Urrea stirs, his thin voice cutting through the tension.\n\n\"Peace, Híjar. His Majesty asked a question. Let us answer it honestly, not defensively.\"\n\nThe old lord turns his weighing gaze to you.\n\n\"The truth, Your Majesty, is that Aragonese military obligation is... undefined. The fueros speak of the king's right to summon the host in defense of the realm. But Constantinople is not the realm. The Ottoman is not at our gates—not yet.\" He pauses. \"If you wish Aragonese knights to ride east, you must give them reason to ride. Glory, perhaps. Or profit. Or lands in the conquered territories. Or simply the satisfaction of having been asked rather than commanded.\"\n\nHe folds his gnarled hands.\n\n\"Alfonso understood this. When he wanted troops for Naples, he came to us with offers, not demands. Titles for those who served. Lands in the conquered kingdom. Shares in the plunder.\" A dry, papery laugh. \"We are not idealists, Your Majesty. We are Aragonese. We calculate.\"\n\nDon Bernat de Centelles clears his throat.\n\n\"Perhaps I may offer a different perspective, my lords.\"\n\nHe looks around the room, then at you.\n\n\"I accompanied His Majesty to Rome, years ago. I have seen how he conducts himself—with honor, with faith, with genuine conviction.\" He raises a hand to forestall objection. \"I am not suggesting we abandon our traditions or our interests. But I would note that His Majesty has not demanded anything today. He has asked.\"\n\nHe turns to address the other nobles directly.\n\n\"When was the last time a king of Aragon asked us what we intended to do, rather than telling us what he required? When was the last time a king came to learn rather than to command?\"\n\nDon Juan de Híjar snorts. \"Pretty words, Centelles. But asking today can become commanding tomorrow.\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" Bernat acknowledges. \"Or perhaps we are being offered something we have not seen in generations—a king who wishes to understand us before he leads us.\"\n\nDon Pedro de Luna, who has been silent until now, speaks. His voice carries the careful weight of a family that learned caution through catastrophe.\n\n\"My lords, we circle the question without answering it.\"\n\nHe looks at you directly.\n\n\"Your Majesty asks how the nobles intend to support the crusade. The honest answer is: we do not yet know. We have not discussed it among ourselves. We have not calculated what we might contribute, or what we might ask in return.\"\n\nHe glances at his fellow nobles.\n\n\"Perhaps that is the conversation we should be having—among ourselves first, and then with Your Majesty. What can Aragon contribute? What should Aragon contribute? And what does Aragon need in return to make such contribution... palatable?\"\n\nDon Felipe de Castro's smile has returned, but it is thoughtful now rather than defensive.\n\n\"Don Pedro speaks wisely. Your Majesty has caught us unprepared—we came expecting to defend our privileges against encroachment, not to discuss crusade contributions.\"\n\nHe tilts his head.\n\n\"If Your Majesty would grant us time to deliberate—a day, perhaps two—we might return with a more substantive answer. Not promises, not yet. But a clearer sense of what the nobility of Aragon might offer, and what we might ask in return.\"\n\nThe others are nodding slowly. Even Don Juan de Híjar seems less hostile—not friendly, but no longer braced for confrontation.\n\nDon Lope Ximénez de Urrea fixes you with his ancient gaze.\n\n\"Will Your Majesty permit us to consult among ourselves? This is how Aragon works, Your Majesty. We deliberate. We negotiate. We find consensus—or we do not, and each lord decides for himself.\" A thin smile. \"It is slower than Castilian command. But it is ours.\"",

      "text": "Diego de Daza steps forward at your gesture, producing several documents from his satchel. The nobles watch with varying degrees of wariness as the administrator spreads parchments across the table.\n\nYou explain the system.\n\n\"In Castile, I established seven mustering points last year—Toledo, Burgos, León, Seville, Córdoba, Valladolid, and Murcia. Each is overseen by a marshal, noble sons trained at my war academy. When the campaign against the Ottoman begins, nobles who wish to contribute bring their men to these points. They are counted, recorded, and then placed under unified command for the campaign.\"\n\nYou tap the first document—the Constitution of Contributions and Claims.\n\n\"This is not a demand. This is an opportunity. No Castilian noble is compelled to contribute. But those who do—those who risk their blood and treasure for the defense of Christendom—earn something beyond glory.\"\n\nYou gesture for Diego to display the relevant sections.\n\n\"Every man contributed is assigned a value. Infantry counts as one. Light cavalry counts as three. Heavy cavalry—knights—counts as five. War galleys count as one hundred infantry equivalent. These values accumulate year by year, recorded in official muster rolls.\"\n\nDon Lope Ximénez de Urrea leans forward despite himself, his ancient eyes scanning the document.\n\n\"And what do these... values... purchase?\" he asks.\n\n\"Titles. Estates. Lands taken from the Ottoman.\" You meet his gaze. \"The Empire we are restoring has lost provinces stretching from Thrace to Macedonia to the Black Sea coast. When we take them back, they must be governed. The men who helped take them will govern them.\"\n\nDiego produces the second document—a table of minimum contribution thresholds.\n\n\"A minor estate or village lordship requires a contribution strength of twenty-five. A district administrator—what the Greeks call prokathemenos—requires fifty. A provincial governor requires one hundred. A duke or military governor requires two hundred.\"\n\nYou pause, letting the numbers sink in.\n\n\"There is also a personal service bonus. A noble who fights personally—not merely sending men, but bearing arms himself, sharing the same dangers as his soldiers—receives an additional twenty points to his contribution. Parchment nobility earns less than fighting nobility.\"\n\nDon Felipe de Castro's careful smile has faded. He is calculating—you can see it in his eyes. The Urgell pretensions suddenly have a path forward that does not involve challenging your throne.\n\n\"And if a house has ancient claims?\" Don Juan de Híjar asks, his hostility momentarily forgotten in genuine curiosity. \"The Híjar held lands in Greece centuries ago, during the Catalan Company's time.\"\n\n\"Claims derived from the Latin Empire of 1204 are void,\" you say flatly. \"That conquest was illegitimate; its grants carry no weight. But claims that predate the Fourth Crusade, or were granted by legitimate Roman Emperors, receive a multiplier of three on their contribution value.\"\n\nDon Bernat de Centelles speaks, his voice thoughtful.\n\n\"So a house with an ancient claim that contributes modestly might outrank a house with no claim that contributes greatly.\"\n\n\"Precisely. The system honors both blood and sacrifice. Neither alone is sufficient, but together they determine precedence.\"\n\nYou point to another section of the document.\n\n\"And note this: a house's contribution is fixed at its muster count for that year. Losses suffered in battle do not reduce recorded contribution. Sacrifice is honored, not punished. A house that loses all its men in faithful service retains full credit. We do not punish those who bleed for Christendom.\"\n\nDon Pedro de Luna stirs. \"And gold? Can a wealthy house simply buy its way to titles?\"\n\n\"No.\" Your voice carries conviction. \"Gold alone counts for nothing. A house may hire mercenaries and present them at muster—that counts. Converting wealth to fighting men is honored. But simply paying coin without fielding soldiers earns nothing. The Empire is restored by swords, not by gold sitting in strongboxes.\"\n\nThe nobles exchange glances. The hostility that filled the room when they entered has shifted to something else—not agreement, not yet, but genuine consideration.\n\nDon Lope Ximénez de Urrea speaks slowly, turning the document in his gnarled hands.\n\n\"This is... not what we expected.\" His thin voice carries wonder. \"You offer Aragonese houses the chance to earn Eastern titles through service. You do not demand we serve—you invite us to profit from service.\"\n\n\"I offer partnership,\" you say. \"The same partnership I offered Castilian houses. Some contributed eagerly. Some held back, calculating. That is their right. But when the lands are divided, when the titles are granted, those who risked nothing will receive nothing.\"\n\nDon Juan de Híjar's arms have uncrossed. He studies the contribution formula with the intensity of a man reassessing everything he thought he knew.\n\n\"And command? You said those who muster place themselves under crown commanders.\"\n\n\"Under unified command. An army with a dozen independent captains is not an army—it is a mob. The Ottoman will destroy such a force in detail.\" You meet his eyes. \"I do not ask for blind obedience. I ask for coordination. For discipline. For the understanding that we fight an enemy who has crushed every disorganized Christian force sent against him.\"\n\nDon Felipe de Castro speaks, his silk-smooth voice now carrying genuine interest.\n\n\"And if Aragonese houses wished to participate in this system... how would it function? Would we muster in Castile? Would we answer to Castilian marshals?\"\n\n\"That,\" you say, \"is precisely what I wish to discuss with you. The system can be adapted. Aragonese mustering points, overseen by Aragonese marshals. The contribution formula remains the same—fairness demands consistency—but the administration can respect Aragonese traditions.\"\n\nYou spread your hands.\n\n\"I am here to learn how Aragon works. Tell me how such a system might function here, and we can build something together. Something that serves both the crusade and Aragonese interests.\"\n\nThe room is silent.\n\nThen Don Lope Ximénez de Urrea laughs—a dry, papery sound, but genuine.\n\n\"By God. A king who asks instead of commands.\" He shakes his head slowly. \"Alfonso never showed us documents. Alfonso simply demanded subsidies and sailed to Italy.\"\n\nDon Bernat de Centelles catches your eye and permits himself a small smile.\n\nThe door that was closed has opened—just a crack, but open nonetheless.",

      "text": "Juan is now pivoting from the military muster system to the registry of privileges (fueros) that he proposed in the Cortes. He's trying to use the goodwill generated by the muster system explanation to push for the registry.\n\nThis is a persuasion attempt. The nobles have just been shown an attractive opportunity (the muster system for Eastern titles), and now Juan is asking them to accept something that makes them more nervous - a central registry of their privileges.\n\nLet me think about the factors:\n\n**The Ask:**\nJuan is requesting that the nobles accept a central registry of all fueros and privileges, maintained by the Justicia, accessible to all.\n\n**Success Factors:**\n1. Juan has just shown them an attractive opportunity - the muster system for Eastern titles\n2. He's framing it as transparency for all, not just royal control\n3. The Justicia would maintain it - an Aragonese institution, not the crown\n4. He's appealing to unity against the Muslim threat\n5. Don Bernat de Centelles has already spoken in favor of the registry\n6. The clergy earlier agreed to transparency - there's precedent in this very negotiation\n7. Juan's approach has been consistently consultative, not demanding\n8. Some nobles (like Don Felipe de Castro with his Urgell claims) might benefit from having their claims officially registered and confirmed\n9. Juan frames it as stopping internal conflict - \"we should be fighting the muslims and not each other\"\n\n**Failure Factors:**\n1. This is the same proposal that caused alarm in the Cortes earlier\n2. Many nobles have privileges that might not survive scrutiny\n3. A registry means the end of \"convenient ambiguity\"\n4. Fear of what the registry will be used for in the future\n5. Precedent - once registered, privileges can be systematically challenged\n6. Don Juan de Híjar specifically called this a \"Castilian trick\" earlier\n7. Loss of leverage - unregistered privileges give nobles negotiating power\n8. The speed of change - they're being asked to accept major reforms very quickly\n \nThe negotiation landscape has subtly transformed. Juan's strategic approach is paying dividends, with key stakeholders showing increased receptiveness. His careful cultivation of trust and demonstration of mutual benefit are creating a more favorable environment for potentially controversial reforms. The nobles, while still cautious, seem more willing to engage with his proposals after witnessing his collaborative method.\n\nA nuanced persuasion strategy will require carefully calibrated diplomatic maneuvering, acknowledging the nobles' underlying concerns while presenting the registry as a shared opportunity rather than a threat.\n\nThe warmth in the room cools slightly. Not to ice—not as it was when you first raised this matter in the Cortes—but the shift is palpable.\n\nDon Juan de Híjar's briefly uncrossed arms fold again. Don Felipe de Castro's calculating expression returns. Even Don Lope Ximénez de Urrea, who laughed a moment ago, settles back with the wariness of a man who has been reminded that gifts sometimes come with strings.\n\nBut they do not reject outright. They do not rise to leave. The muster system has purchased something—attention, perhaps, or at least the willingness to hear more.\n\nDon Felipe de Castro speaks first, his voice carefully modulated.\n\n\"Your Majesty returns to the registry.\" It is not quite an accusation. \"The matter that so... animated the Cortes this morning.\"\n\n\"Because it is connected,\" you reply. \"The muster system works because it is transparent. Every contribution recorded, every claim documented, every house knowing where it stands relative to others. Clarity prevents disputes. Disputes weaken us when we should be united.\"\n\nDon Juan de Híjar makes a low sound—not quite a growl, but near it.\n\n\"The muster system offers us something, Your Majesty. Titles. Estates. Opportunity.\" His voice is blunt. \"The registry offers us... what? The pleasure of having our ancient rights catalogued so they may be more easily challenged?\"\n\nDon Bernat de Centelles interjects before you can respond.\n\n\"My lord of Híjar, I spoke in favor of the registry this morning, and I will speak for it again.\" He turns to address the room. \"How many of us have spent years—decades—in litigation over competing privileges? How many have had neighbors produce documents from nowhere, claiming rights that conflict with our own? How many have wondered whether our documents would survive scrutiny if a hostile king chose to challenge them?\"\n\nHe gestures toward you.\n\n\"His Majesty proposes that the Justicia maintain the registry. Not the crown—the Justicia. The same office that protects us from royal overreach. A privilege registered with the Justicia becomes unassailable. It cannot be questioned, cannot be challenged, cannot be lost to fire or theft or convenient forgetting.\"\n\nDon Pedro de Luna stirs.\n\n\"And what of privileges that are not registered? What becomes of them?\"\n\nThe question hangs in the air. This is the heart of it—the fear that the registry is not protection but trap.\n\nDon Lope Ximénez de Urrea speaks, his ancient voice thoughtful.\n\n\"I am old enough to remember when Alfonso's grandfather crushed the Union. Old enough to remember what kings do when they have power and knowledge both.\" His rheumy eyes fix on you. \"You speak of fighting Muslims, not each other. Fine words. But the registry serves the crown's interests as much as ours—perhaps more. Once you know what privileges exist, you know which to target.\"\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\"Unless there are... guarantees. Assurances that registration protects rather than exposes.\"\n\nThe other nobles are nodding slowly. This is the crux: they are not opposed to clarity in principle, but they fear what clarity will cost them in practice.\n\nPERSUASION ANALYSIS: The Registry of Privileges\n\nStep 1: The Ask\n\nJuan is requesting that the Aragonese nobility accept a central registry of all fueros and privileges, maintained by the Justicia, accessible to all.\n\nStep 2: Evaluating Juan's Approach\n\nStrengths:\n\nBuilds on momentum from the successful muster system presentation\n\nFrames registry as connected to transparency that makes the muster system work\n\nEmphasizes unity against external threat (\"fighting Muslims, not each other\")\n\nJusticia custody, not royal custody—respects Aragonese institutions\n\nDon Bernat de Centelles is actively supporting the proposal\n\nWeaknesses:\n\nDoes not address what happens to unregistered privileges\n\nDoes not offer specific guarantees against future royal challenges\n\nThe pivot from muster system to registry feels like pressing advantage\n\nNobles remember this caused alarm in the Cortes—they are primed for suspicion\n\nStep 3: Factor Identification\n\nSuccess Factors:\n\nJuan has just demonstrated good faith with the muster system\n\nDon Bernat de Centelles is actively advocating for the registry\n\nJusticia custody genuinely protects noble interests\n\nSome nobles would benefit from having disputed claims officially confirmed\n\nThe clergy have already agreed to similar transparency\n\nJuan's consultative approach has built some trust\n\nRegistration does make privileges unassailable—this is genuinely valuable\n\nDon Lope's question about \"guarantees\" suggests openness if concerns are addressed\n\nFailure Factors (weighted 2:1):\n\nFundamental fear that knowledge enables targeting\n\nPrivileges that cannot survive scrutiny will be exposed\n\nLoss of \"convenient ambiguity\" that protects questionable claims\n\nSpeed of change—major reform proposed very quickly\n\nDon Juan de Híjar remains hostile to the core concept\n\nPrecedent concerns—what comes after the registry?\n\nSome houses have privileges that contradict other houses' privileges\n\nThe question of unregistered privileges remains unanswered\n\nStep 4: Factor Balance\n\nThis is more favorable than the merchant negotiation but still weighted toward caution. The nobles are intrigued but not convinced. They need assurances—specific guarantees that registration protects rather than exposes.\n\nPERSUASION TABLE: The Noble Registry of Privileges\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-10\nUnified Rejection. Don Juan de Híjar speaks for the majority: the registry is a Castilian trap, and no amount of fine words changes that. The nobles will oppose any such measure in the Cortes. The goodwill from the muster system evaporates. Juan has pushed too far, too fast.\n11-20\nFirm Resistance. The nobles acknowledge Juan's good intentions but refuse the registry. Don Lope speaks of \"guarantees\" but none offered could satisfy them. They will accept the muster system but not the cataloguing of their ancient rights. The door closes on this proposal.\n21-30\nSuspicious Delay. The nobles propose endless study—a commission, consultations with absent lords, review by legal scholars. They are buying time, hoping Juan will be distracted by other matters. No progress is made, but outright rejection is avoided.\n31-40\nConditional Consideration. The nobles will consider the registry if Juan provides ironclad guarantees: registered privileges cannot be challenged by the crown for any reason, unregistered privileges retain validity for a generous transition period, and the process is entirely voluntary. They are negotiating, but from a position of deep suspicion.\n41-50\nGrudging Engagement. Don Lope's question about guarantees becomes the framework for discussion. The nobles will engage seriously if Juan addresses their core fear: that the registry will be used against them. Specific protections must be negotiated, but the conversation continues.\n51-60\nConstructive Counter-Proposal. Don Bernat's advocacy gains traction. The nobles propose a modified registry: voluntary registration with strong incentives (registered privileges receive enhanced legal protection), maintained by the Justicia with noble oversight, and a guarantee that unregistered privileges remain valid for at least a generation. They are negotiating in good faith.\n61-70\nCautious Agreement. The nobles accept the principle of a registry, with conditions. The Justicia maintains custody. Registration is voluntary for a transition period. Registered privileges become legally unassailable. A noble committee oversees the process. Don Juan de Híjar remains skeptical but does not block consensus.\n71-80\nGenuine Support. Don Lope's concerns are addressed, and the old lord throws his weight behind the proposal. The nobility sees the value: clarity, protection, an end to endless litigation. They accept a registry with reasonable safeguards. Even Don Juan de Híjar, while grumbling, does not oppose.\n81-90\nEnthusiastic Acceptance. The muster system and the registry are seen as parts of a coherent vision. Don Felipe de Castro recognizes that the Urgell claims could be officially registered and confirmed—ending decades of ambiguity. The nobles embrace the registry as protection, not threat. Don Bernat's advocacy has carried the day.\n91-100\nTransformative Moment. Something shifts. The nobles see not a Castilian king seeking to catalogue their rights, but a reformer offering genuine partnership. They propose expanding the registry beyond what Juan asked—including obligations owed to noble houses, not just privileges held by them. The registry becomes a tool for noble empowerment, with the crown's duties recorded alongside noble rights.\n\nRoll when ready.",

Can future kings revoke what this king has confirmed?\"\n\nA second finger rises.\n\n\"Second: what becomes of privileges that are not registered? If a house declines to participate, or cannot locate its ancient documents, or simply chooses to wait—are those privileges void? Suspect? Vulnerable?\"\n\nA third finger.\n\n\"Third: who oversees this process? You say the Justicia. Very well. But the Justicia is one man. He has clerks, scribes, lieutenants. Who ensures that the registry is administered fairly? That powerful houses do not receive favorable treatment while lesser houses are scrutinized harshly?\"\n\nHe lowers his hand.\n\n\"Answer these questions to my satisfaction, Your Majesty, and you may find the nobility of Aragon more amenable than we have appeared.\"\n\nThe room waits.\n\nDon Felipe de Castro's calculating eyes are fixed on you. Don Pedro de Luna watches with the careful attention of a family that learned caution through catastrophe. Even Don Juan de Híjar has uncrossed his arms, though his expression remains skeptical.\n\nThis is the moment. The door is open—but only if you walk through it correctly.\n\nYou speak.\n\n\"First: a privilege once registered becomes unassailable.\" You let the word hang in the air. \"Not merely confirmed, but beyond challenge. No future king may revoke what the registry records. The act of registration transforms a privilege from a claim that might be disputed into a right that cannot be disputed. This is not my promise alone—it must be written into the registry's founding charter, sworn before the Cortes, sealed with the authority of the Justicia himself.\"\n\nDon Lope nods slowly, but says nothing.\n\n\"Second: unregistered privileges remain valid.\" You raise a hand to forestall objection. \"For a generation—twenty-five years from the registry's establishment—any privilege not yet registered retains its current status. No house will be punished for delay, for caution, for the simple difficulty of locating documents that may be centuries old. Those who register early gain the benefit of unassailable confirmation. Those who wait lose nothing they currently possess.\"\n\nDon Felipe's eyebrows rise slightly. This is more generous than he expected.\n\n\"But,\" you continue, \"after the transition period, unregistered privileges become questionable. Not void—but subject to the same disputes and litigation that plague the current system. The registry offers protection. Refusing the registry means accepting the risks of ambiguity.\"\n\n\"And third.\" You turn to address the room fully. \"The Justicia will maintain the registry—but he will not act alone. I propose a committee of oversight: three nobles appointed by the Cortes, rotating every five years, with full authority to review any decision the Justicia's office makes regarding registration. No privilege may be rejected without the committee's review. No house may be treated differently than any other.\"\n\nYou pause.\n\n\"The crown will have no representative on this committee. This is not a royal institution with Aragonese trappings. It is an Aragonese institution, maintained by Aragonese officers, overseen by Aragonese nobles, protecting Aragonese rights.\"\n\nDon Lope Ximénez de Urrea is silent for a long moment. Then he turns to his fellow nobles.\n\n\"My lords. I have opposed kings for sixty years. I opposed Pedro when he tried to break the Union. I opposed Juan when he tried to tax without consent. I opposed Alfonso when he bled us dry for his Italian dreams.\" His thin voice carries the weight of a lifetime. \"I know what royal overreach looks like. I have fought it all my life.\"\n\nHe gestures toward you.\n\n\"This is not that. This king offers us protections no king has offered before. A registry we control. A transition we set. Privileges that become unassailable rather than vulnerable.\"\n\nHe spreads his gnarled hands.\n\n\"I am old. I will not live to see whether this king keeps his promises. But I have grandchildren, and great-grandchildren, and I would leave them a system that protects their rights rather than endless uncertainty that invites future kings to take what they wish.\"\n\nHe looks around the room.\n\n\"I support the registry. With the conditions His Majesty has stated. Let it be written, let it be sworn, and let us have done with three centuries of ambiguity.\"\n\nDon Bernat de Centelles immediately speaks. \"I concur with Don Lope. The conditions are reasonable. The protections are genuine. House Centelles will register its privileges.\"\n\nDon Pedro de Luna hesitates, then nods slowly. \"House Luna has... complex history with royal authority. But this offers something we have never had: certainty. I support the registry.\"\n\nDon Felipe de Castro's smile has returned—but it is thoughtful now rather than defensive. \"The Urgell claims have been in dispute for a generation. If registration makes them unassailable...\" He inclines his head. \"House Castro supports the registry.\"\n\nAll eyes turn to Don Juan de Híjar.\n\nThe lord of Híjar stands with his arms crossed, jaw tight, every line of his body radiating resistance. He has been the voice of opposition since you arrived. He called your proposal a \"Castilian trick\" in the Cortes. He has fought you at every turn.\n\nThe silence stretches.\n\nFinally, he speaks.\n\n\"I do not trust you, Your Majesty.\" His voice is flat. \"I do not trust any king who speaks so smoothly of protecting noble rights. Kings protect their own power. That is what kings do.\"\n\nHe looks around at his fellow nobles.\n\n\"But I am not fool enough to stand alone against the consensus of this room. Don Lope has more experience than all of us combined. If he believes these protections are genuine...\" Híjar's jaw works. \"Then I will not block what the others support.\"\n\nHe fixes you with a hard stare.\n\n\"But know this: I will be watching. My house will register its privileges—and we will watch to see whether the promises made today are kept tomorrow. The first sign that this registry is being used against us, the first hint that registration makes us vulnerable rather than protected...\"\n\nHe does not finish the sentence. He does not need to.\n\nDon Lope Ximénez de Urrea laughs—that dry, papery sound again.\n\n\"Don Juan's suspicion will serve us well. Every institution needs a watchdog.\" He turns to you. \"Your Majesty has the nobility's conditional support for the registry. The conditions are: unassailable confirmation, a twenty-five-year transition, and a noble oversight committee with no royal participation.\"\n\nHe rises, slowly, painfully, but with dignity.\n\n\"Now. Shall we discuss how this might be presented to the full Cortes? Because convincing a dozen lords in a private chamber is one thing. Convincing two hundred in the Hall of Marbles is quite another.\"",

If the fueros cannot be located, then they can not be enforced. If they cannot be located but it was granted verbally for example, they will be granted in writing at the central registry. A lot of work for the judiciar, but it will ensure that those feuros who have been lost are again rightfully written down. And if after a long time a fueros is discovered somewhere, then it can always be entered into the registry. But we will have to take into account the fact that that the fuero is discovered later. If there suddenly appears a fuero that challenges another that is registered for years, the registered one speaks to it's advantage.\n\nThe justicia should be trusted and I have assumed that it is, given that he already guards the written down fueros. The office should be incorruptible for sure and I trust that there are already procedures in place to make it so. But it would be inproper for me to take charge of the office of the justicia as it would violate the very fueros I am swearing to.

      "text": "1. On swearing to uphold fueros and needing to know what they are - this is a strong logical argument\n2. On the transition period and precedence of registered vs unregistered fueros - this is reasonable and addresses their concerns\n3. On the Justicia's independence - this is clever, Juan is essentially saying he won't interfere with the office and that any reforms to strengthen it must come from the nobles themselves\n\nI should show the nobles' reactions - some impressed, some still cautious, but overall moving toward acceptance. Don Lope asked the questions, so he should be the one primarily responding. The other nobles can react as well.\n\nThe nobles listen in silence as you address each of Don Lope's questions in turn.\n\nWhen you finish, the old lord's expression has shifted. The wariness remains—it will likely never fully leave a man who has spent sixty years guarding against royal overreach—but something else has joined it. Respect, perhaps. Or at least the acknowledgment that he is dealing with a mind that understands the game.\n\n\"You turn my questions back upon themselves,\" Don Lope says slowly. \"You cannot defend fueros you do not know exist. You cannot enforce privileges that cannot be located. And you cannot reform an office whose independence you are sworn to protect.\"\n\nHe shakes his head, a sound escaping him that might be a laugh or a sigh.\n\n\"I have negotiated with four kings of Aragon. Not one of them would have answered as you have. They would have demanded oversight. They would have insisted on royal involvement. They would have seen the Justicia as a tool to be controlled, not an institution to be respected.\"\n\nDon Felipe de Castro speaks, his silk-smooth voice carrying genuine curiosity now rather than calculation.\n\n\"Your Majesty suggests that if the nobles wish to strengthen the Justicia's independence, we must do so ourselves. That you will not—cannot—interfere without violating your own oath.\" He tilts his head. \"This is either extraordinary principle or extraordinary cunning. I confess I cannot determine which.\"\n\nDon Bernat de Centelles permits himself a small smile. \"Does it matter, my lord of Castro? The outcome is the same. The Justicia remains independent. The registry remains in Aragonese hands. The crown binds itself by its own oath.\"\n\nDon Juan de Híjar has been silent, his arms still crossed, his expression unreadable. Now he speaks, his voice rough.\n\n\"The point about verbal grants. Fueros spoken but never written.\" He fixes you with a hard stare. \"There are houses in Aragon whose privileges exist only in memory—passed from father to son, honored by custom, never challenged because everyone knew they were valid. Your Majesty proposes to write these down. To make them real in a way they have never been.\"\n\nHe pauses, and something shifts in his bearing—not warmth, not trust, but perhaps the first crack in the wall of suspicion.\n\n\"My grandmother held grazing rights on crown lands near Híjar. Her grandmother held them before her. No document exists. No seal was ever set. But the rights are real. They have been honored for two hundred years.\"\n\nHe looks around at his fellow nobles.\n\n\"If this registry allows such rights to be written down—to be made permanent, protected, unassailable—then it offers something no king has offered before.\" His jaw tightens. \"I still do not trust you, Your Majesty. But I begin to see why Don Lope does.\"\n\nDon Pedro de Luna speaks, his voice carrying the careful weight of a family that has learned caution through generations.\n\n\"Your Majesty's third point—that reforms to the Justicia must come from the nobles themselves—this is significant. It acknowledges limits. It respects boundaries.\" He pauses. \"My family once placed a kinsman on the papal throne. We learned what happens when power is concentrated without constraint. Benedict's fall taught us that even sacred authority requires checks.\"\n\nHe inclines his head.\n\n\"House Luna will support the registry. And we will propose, through proper channels in the Cortes, measures to strengthen the Justicia's office—additional clerks, secure archives, procedures for verification. These will come from the noble estate, as Your Majesty suggests. The crown need not be involved.\"\n\nDon Lope Ximénez de Urrea rises once more, using the table for support.\n\n\"We have talked enough. The conditions are clear. The protections are genuine. The independence of the Justicia is preserved.\" He looks around the room, meeting each lord's eyes in turn. \"Are we agreed? Do we bring this to the Cortes with noble support?\"\n\nOne by one, the lords nod.\n\nDon Bernat de Centelles. Don Pedro de Luna. Don Felipe de Castro.\n\nEven Don Juan de Híjar, after a long pause, gives a single curt nod.\n\nDon Lope turns back to you.\n\n\"Your Majesty has the nobility's support—conditional, watchful, but genuine. We will speak for the registry in the Cortes. We will advocate for the conditions we have discussed here.\" His ancient eyes hold yours. \"The clergy have agreed. The nobles have agreed. The merchants...\"\n\nHe glances toward the door, toward the city beyond where Berenguer de Montcada and his fellows are no doubt conferring among themselves.\n\n\"The merchants remain. They are the hardest to persuade, for they think in profit and loss rather than honor and precedent. But if clergy and nobility stand together, the cities may find themselves isolated.\"\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\"Does Your Majesty wish us to approach them? To explain that the estates are uniting behind these proposals? Sometimes merchants respond better to the threat of being left out than to the promise of being included.\"",

The merchants will respond based on the situation.\n\nThe Aljafería Palace — Later That Evening\n\nYou find the merchants where you left them—in their smaller chamber, huddled in conversation that falls silent the moment you enter. The tension from your earlier meeting lingers in the room like smoke after a fire.\n\nBerenguer de Montcada rises, his expression guarded. Guillem de Santcliment and Pere de Casaldàguila flank him, watching you with the careful eyes of men who have not forgotten the words \"balance the scales.\"\n\n\"Your Majesty returns,\" Berenguer says. His voice is neutral—not hostile, but far from warm.\n\nYou enter without guards, without Diego or Isaac. Just a king, alone, coming to speak with merchants.\n\nYou explain what has transpired.\n\nThe clergy have agreed to support a petition to Rome clarifying the tercias, with the revenues dedicated to the crusade. They have accepted royal auditors working alongside Church officials, with transparent accounting.\n\nThe nobility have agreed to the registry of privileges, maintained by the Justicia, with a twenty-five-year transition period and a noble oversight committee. They have embraced the muster system as an opportunity rather than an obligation.\n\nYou do not demand that the merchants join these agreements. You do not threaten consequences for refusal. You simply... inform.\n\nAnd then you speak of your vision.\n\nInvestment in production—the Junta de Manufacturas bringing foreign experts to teach Castilian craftsmen, the expansion of foundries and shipyards, the development of industries that will create goods for trade rather than merely consuming imports.\n\nExploration—the African ventures already underway, the Mali expedition that has reached Timbuktu, the Senegal outpost opening routes to gold and ivory and spices that have never flowed through Christian hands.\n\nThe fleet—expanded, modernized, capable of protecting trade routes from Barcelona to Constantinople to the African coast. Safer seas mean more trade. More trade means more prosperity.\n\nYou hope for their support. You do not require it.\n\nThe merchants listen in silence.\n\nWhen you finish, Berenguer de Montcada exchanges glances with his colleagues. Something passes between them—the silent communication of men who have done business together for decades.\n\n\"Your Majesty speaks differently than before,\" Berenguer says slowly. \"No demands. No threats. No talk of balancing scales.\"\n\n\"I spoke poorly before,\" you acknowledge. \"I am learning how Aragon works. It is... different from Castile.\"\n\nGuillem de Santcliment leans forward.\n\n\"The clergy have agreed. The nobility have agreed.\" His sharp Valencian eyes study your face. \"And now you come to us, last of the three estates, and you hope for our support rather than demanding it.\"\n\nHe glances at Berenguer.\n\n\"We have been discussing, Your Majesty. While you met with the nobles, we talked among ourselves. About what you said. About what you offered. About what you... apologized for.\"\n\nPere de Casaldàguila speaks, his dry voice thoughtful.\n\n\"The Mali expedition. The African trade. These are real?\" When you confirm, he nods slowly. \"Barcelona has dreamed of breaking the Genoese monopoly on Eastern goods for generations. If there are routes that bypass the Italian middlemen...\"\n\nBerenguer de Montcada raises a hand, silencing his colleagues.\n\n\"Your Majesty. The cities of Aragon are not opposed to prosperity. We are not opposed to investment, exploration, or expanded trade.\" He pauses, choosing his words with care. \"We were opposed to demands. To being told that Castilian methods would be imposed on Aragonese ports. To threats, however veiled, about consequences for resistance.\"\n\nHe looks at you directly.\n\n\"You have come back without demands. Without threats. You have told us what you hope to achieve and asked for our support rather than requiring our submission.\"\n\nA long pause.\n\n\"This is... different. This we can work with.\"\n\nHe glances at Guillem and Pere, receiving small nods.\n\n\"The cities will not oppose the registry of privileges. It does not touch our core interests—our charters are well-documented, our rights clearly established. If the nobles wish to catalogue their ancient grants, that is their affair.\"\n\n\"As for trade...\" Guillem takes up the thread. \"We proposed earlier that Aragonese merchants be partners in future ventures, not merely subjects paying for access. If Your Majesty is serious about investment and exploration, we would discuss what partnership might look like.\"\n\nPere de Casaldàguila adds quietly: \"And the matter of customs collection—the issue that so troubled our earlier conversation—perhaps this can be revisited when there is more trust. Not today. Not tomorrow. But... eventually.\"\n\nBerenguer de Montcada rises, and his colleagues rise with him.\n\n\"Your Majesty sought our support. You do not have our enthusiastic support—not yet. Trust must be earned, and one conversation does not erase the concerns we raised.\" His merchant's eyes hold yours. \"But you have our... willingness. Willingness to listen. Willingness to negotiate. Willingness to see whether this king is different from the kings who came before.\"\n\nHe offers a bow—deeper than the shallow, formal gesture from earlier, though still far from warm.\n\n\"The Cortes reconvenes tomorrow. The cities will not oppose Your Majesty's coronation. We will not oppose the registry. We will watch, and we will wait, and we will see whether the words spoken today become the deeds of tomorrow.\"\n\nHe pauses at the door.\n\n\"Your Majesty mentioned the Mali expedition. The gold trade. The routes to Africa.\" A flicker of genuine interest breaks through his careful neutrality. \"When there is time—after the coronation, after the immediate business is concluded—Barcelona would very much like to hear more about these ventures. In detail.\"\n\nThe merchants depart, leaving you alone in the chamber.\n\nThe door closes softly.\n\nMaría appears from wherever she has been observing—you are beginning to suspect your sister has learned to move through this palace like a ghost.\n\n\"That,\" she says quietly, \"was much better.\"\n\nShe moves to the window, looking out over Zaragoza in the fading light.\n\n\"The clergy support you. The nobility support you—cautiously, conditionally, but genuinely. The merchants are willing to listen.\" She turns back to face you. \"Tomorrow you face the full Cortes. Three hundred men who have heard rumors of what transpired today, who are trying to decide whether you are savior or conqueror.\"\n\nShe pauses.\n\n\"You have done something remarkable, Juan. In two days, you have won more support than Alfonso earned in twenty years. But tomorrow is the test. Tomorrow you must swear the oath, accept the conditions, and become King of Aragon in truth.\"\n\nHer grey eyes—so like your own—hold yours.\n\n\"Are you ready?\"",

Creates a separate registry decree\n3. Develops distinct agreements with ecclesiastical authorities\n\nThe key is finding a procedural mechanism that respects historical legal traditions while incorporating new negotiated terms. This requires precise legal drafting that maintains the spirit of Aragonese constitutional practices.\n\nYes, let me confirm my understanding before drafting.\n\nWhat I understand has been agreed:\n\nWith the Clergy (Tercias Agreement):\n\nJoint petition to Rome requesting clarification (not seizure) of the crown's right to the tercias\n\nTercias revenues dedicated specifically to the crusade, not general treasury—a separate accounting\n\nRoyal auditors working alongside Church officials; Church officials still collect\n\nCrown commits to building churches in the East, Africa, and new lands\n\nArchbishop Dalmau will draft the petition for Juan's seal\n\nWith the Nobility (Registry of Privileges):\n\nCentral registry maintained by the Justicia, not the crown\n\nRegistered privileges become unassailable—no future king may challenge them\n\n25-year transition period during which unregistered privileges remain valid\n\nAfter transition, registered privileges take precedence over unregistered ones in disputes\n\nNoble oversight committee: 3 nobles appointed by Cortes, rotating every 5 years, NO royal representation\n\nVerbal/customary privileges may be written down and registered\n\nLater-discovered fueros may still be registered, but earlier-registered privileges take precedence in conflicts\n\nJusticia's independence preserved; any reforms to that office must come from the nobles, not the crown\n\nThe Muster System (Constantinople Campaign):\n\nVoluntary participation—no noble is compelled to contribute\n\nThose who muster place themselves under unified command\n\nContribution earns titles and estates in reconquered Eastern territories\n\nThe Constitution of Contributions and Claims applies\n\nWith the Merchants:\n\nNo binding agreements yet—only willingness to negotiate further\n\nThey want partnership in future ventures, not subjugation\n\nCustoms collection reform deferred until trust is established\n\nThey are interested in African/Mali trade access\n\nMy question before drafting:\n\nThe Fueros de Aragón are ancient laws that cannot simply be rewritten by royal decree. What I believe you want is one of the following:\n\nA Cortes Decree — A new law passed by the Cortes (with royal consent) establishing the Central Registry as an addition to the existing fueros\n\nMultiple Documents — Separate instruments for each agreement:\n\nThe Registry Charter (nobility)\n\nThe Tercias Petition/Agreement (clergy)\n\nThe Muster System provisions (already exist in the Constitution of Contributions and Claims)\n\nAn Omnibus Reform Act — A single comprehensive decree from the 1437 Cortes incorporating all the new provisions\n\nWhich approach would you prefer?",
