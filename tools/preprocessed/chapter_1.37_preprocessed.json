      "text": "Perfect. I now have a clear understanding. The siege of Alhama began on the morning of April 21, 1432. The bombardment has just started. The garrison of 350 defenders has refused surrender terms despite understanding their military situation, because their families are held hostage in Granada city by the Sultan. The expected timeline is 2-3 weeks of bombardment before a breach is achieved, then an assault and surrender.\n\nThe emotional weight is heavy - Juan sympathizes with these garrison commanders who are trapped between military reality and love for their families. The chapter ended with the first cannon firing.\n\nSo Chapter 37 should begin shortly after the bombardment has started - probably later that same day or the next day, showing the progression of the siege. I should keep responses short during active scenes, describe the bombardment's effects, and wait for Juan to act.\n\nLet me also check what the current treasury status is, and see if there are any other important details I should know.\n\nI don't see a specific treasury figure for April 1432 in these results. The most recent detailed financial information is from late 1431, showing the crusade treasury at ~530,841 florins. The 1432 budget shows various expenses, but I don't have the exact current treasury amount as of April 21, 1432.\n\nAccording to the instructions, the player maintains an external tracking document with the current treasury figure and provides it at the end of each session. I should begin the chapter now and not worry about the exact treasury figure until the end-of-chapter bookkeeping.\n\nLet me start Chapter 37, picking up shortly after the bombardment has begun on April 21, 1432.\n\nCHAPTER 37: THE SIEGE OF ALHAMA\n\nDate: April 21, 1432 (Late Afternoon)\nLocation: Siege Camp Outside Alhama de Granada\n\nThe thunder of the bombards had settled into a steady, methodical rhythm. Every hour or so, another stone ball would arc through the air and crash against Alhama's western wall. Dust rose with each impact, drifting across the gorge in lazy clouds before dispersing in the mountain breeze.\n\nJuan stood on a slight rise overlooking the siege works, watching the fifth shot of the afternoon slam home. The wall shuddered. Small chips of masonry fell away. The damage was incremental but relentless—this was the patient work of artillery, measured in days and weeks rather than hours.\n\nPietro Calabrese approached from the gun positions, wiping powder residue from his hands. \"Your Majesty. The first day proceeds well. All five guns performing properly. We've fired twenty-three shots since this morning—good pace without overheating the barrels. The western wall is taking the impacts cleanly. No complications yet.\"\n\nBehind them, the camp sprawled across the valley floor. Fifteen thousand eight hundred men at various tasks—digging entrenchments, setting up supply stations, tending horses, cooking meals. The professional hum of a siege establishing itself.\n\nDon Álvaro de Luna stood nearby, reviewing supply reports with one of the quartermasters. He finished his conversation and joined Juan and Pietro. \"The siege is well-established. Supplies flowing smoothly from Íllora. No sign of relief forces or interference. Granada either cannot or will not contest us here.\"\n\nHe paused, glancing toward the fortress walls. \"Different from Íllora, isn't it? At Íllora, Commander Hamza was defiant—pride and honor keeping him on those walls. Here...\" He shook his head slightly. \"Those men inside know exactly what's happening. They just can't act on it.\"\n\nWhat would you like to do?",

Barrel cracks on one bombard, killing 3 crew members and injuring 5 more. Requires complete replacement (8-10 days delay) or continue with only 4 guns. Morale shaken. Timeline: 4+ weeks to breach.\n\n6-12: SEVERE COMPLICATIONS\nMultiple problems compound: poor powder batch causes misfires, unseasonable rain disrupts operations for 5 days, garrison makes successful sortie damaging one gun carriage. Timeline: 3.5-4 weeks to breach. 15-20 additional casualties from sortie.\n\n13-20: SIGNIFICANT DELAYS\nWall construction proves exceptionally solid—thick rubble core, well-maintained mortar. Progress frustratingly slow. Defenders make minor repairs at night. No critical failures but grinding attrition. Timeline: 3-3.5 weeks to breach.\n\n21-30: BELOW EXPECTATIONS\nSolid walls, competent defender repairs, occasional weather delays. Professional but unremarkable progress. Pietro frustrated but professional. Timeline: 2.5-3 weeks to breach. Nothing special, just hard work.\n\n31-50: STANDARD SIEGE PROGRESS\nWalls crack and crumble at expected pace. Defenders repair at night but bombardment outpaces them. No major complications or advantages. Professional execution on both sides. Timeline: 2-2.5 weeks to breach as originally estimated.\n\n51-65: BETTER THAN EXPECTED\nWall section shows signs of older construction—mortar degraded over decades. Pietro identifies weakness and concentrates fire effectively. Minor structural failure accelerates progress. Timeline: 1.5-2 weeks to breach.\n\n66-78: STRONG PROGRESS\nExcellent crew performance, ideal weather, defenders demoralized after early wall damage. One section collapses cleanly after 10 days, creating partial breach. Second breach point developing rapidly. Timeline: 10-14 days to full assault-ready breach.\n\n79-87: EXCEPTIONAL EXECUTION\nPietro discovers critical weakness in wall foundation (old earthquake damage or poor repair). Concentrated bombardment causes cascading failures. Major section collapses by day 8. Garrison realizes futility immediately. Timeline: 8-10 days to breach.\n\n88-94: RAPID COLLAPSE\nWall construction fundamentally flawed—perhaps water damage undermining foundation, or different-quality stone used in repairs decades ago. First major breach by day 6-7. Garrison sends negotiators before assault becomes necessary. Timeline: 6-8 days, possible surrender before assault.\n\n95-98: SPECTACULAR BREACH\nMultiple structural weaknesses compound. First bombardment day reveals serious problems. By day 4-5, entire western wall section (40+ feet) collapses in dramatic cascade. Garrison immediately requests terms—assault unnecessary. Timeline: 4-5 days, surrender without assault.\n\n99-100: MIRACULOUS FORTUNE\nWall has critical hidden flaw (underground water erosion, ancient construction defect). First day's bombardment triggers chain reaction. By day 2-3, massive collapse creates multiple breach points. Garrison stunned. Officers approach walls requesting immediate negotiation. Timeline: 2-3 days, immediate surrender discussions.\n\nReady when you are to roll the physical d100.",

      "text": "\"Excellent crew performance, ideal weather, defenders demoralized after early wall damage. One section collapses cleanly after 10 days, creating partial breach. Second breach point developing rapidly. Timeline: 10-14 days to full assault-ready breach.\"\n\nThis is a good result - better than the standard 2-2.5 weeks. The siege will progress well with a partial collapse after 10 days and a full breach ready in 10-14 days total.\n\nI need to:\n1. Narrate the progression of the bombardment over these days\n2. Show excellent crew performance and ideal conditions\n3. Describe the partial collapse after 10 days\n4. Show the garrison's reaction - they know what's coming and are demoralized\n5. Keep it relatively short (5-8 paragraphs) since this is narrating events rather than dialogue\n6. End at a natural stopping point for player action\n\nI should track the days:\n- April 21: Bombardment begins\n- April 22-30: First 9 days of bombardment\n- May 1: Day 10 - partial collapse\n- May 2-5: Days 11-14 continuing toward full breach\n\nI'll narrate through to the partial collapse and the immediate aftermath, then stop for player input on how to proceed.\n\nTHE BOMBARDMENT OF ALHAMA - DAYS 1-10\n\nApril 21-30, 1432\n\nThe siege of Alhama unfolded with the kind of professional precision that comes from experience and favorable circumstances. The weather held clear and mild—spring mountain air without the storms that had plagued Málaga or the oppressive heat of summer campaigns. Pietro's gun crews, veterans now of multiple sieges, worked with smooth efficiency. Load, aim, fire, swab, repeat. Six to eight shots per gun per day, every shot counted and recorded.\n\nBy the third day, visible progress showed on the western wall. The mortar between stones began to crumble under repeated impacts. Pietro identified his target zone—a section about thirty feet wide where the wall showed subtle signs of settlement, perhaps from decades of mountain weather and minor earthquakes. He concentrated three guns on this weakness while the other two bombards kept up harassing fire elsewhere to prevent defenders from focusing all their repair efforts in one place.\n\nThe garrison tried. Every night, work parties emerged with torches to patch the damage—stuffing rubble into gaps, applying fresh mortar, shoring up weakened sections with timber. But the mathematics were against them. Each day's bombardment undid more than each night's repairs could restore. The cracks spread. The wall face began to bow slightly inward.\n\nOn the morning of May 1st—the tenth day of bombardment—something changed. Pietro noticed it first as he sighted the morning's opening shot: the target section was visibly different from the evening before, showing deeper stress fractures radiating from the impact points. \"Today,\" he told Juan quietly. \"Today or tomorrow, that section comes down.\"\n\nHe was right. The afternoon bombardment—the forty-seventh shot of the day—struck the weakened section with a sound different from all the others. Not the usual crack of stone on stone, but a deeper, groaning rumble. For a moment nothing happened. Then the entire section—thirty feet wide, twenty feet high—slumped forward like a tired man sitting down. Stones tumbled. Dust billowed. When it cleared, a breach gaped in the wall: not yet assault-ready, with rubble piled high at the base, but unmistakably a major structural failure.\n\nFrom the Castilian lines, a cheer erupted. From Alhama's walls, visible dismay. Officers could be seen gathering, pointing, arguing. The garrison had known this moment was coming—but knowing and witnessing are different things.\n\nPietro approached Juan with satisfaction evident in his weathered face. \"Ten days to first breach. Better than I projected, Your Majesty. The section came down clean—good rubble pile, minimal debris spread. Another three to four days of concentrated fire to widen it and create proper assault ramps, and we'll have an opening your infantry can use. Call it May 4th or 5th for assault readiness.\"\n\nDon Álvaro added his assessment: \"The garrison saw that collapse. They know what it means. We might see negotiators before we need to assault.\" He paused, watching the walls. \"Or they might fight anyway, for their families' sake. Hard to say. But that breach broke something inside those walls—you could see it in how the officers reacted.\"\n\nThe siege camp that evening buzzed with the energy of visible progress. Morale was high. Casualties remained minimal—only a handful of wounded from minor skirmishes and accidents. Everything proceeding according to plan, even better than plan.\n\nWhat do you do?",

      "text": "1. They already explained they can't surrender because of family hostages in Granada\n2. But the breach is now real - the theoretical has become actual\n3. They said they would \"fight honorably, resist long enough to show they tried, then surrender when impossible to continue\"\n4. The question is: is 10 days of bombardment and one breach \"enough\" resistance to protect their families from Sultan's wrath?\n5. Or do they need to actually fight an assault?\n\nHistorical context:\n- Medieval garrisons often had an understanding of \"honorable resistance\" - once a breach was made and assault was imminent, surrender was acceptable\n- But this is complicated by the hostage system\n- Martin as messenger is perfect - he's the bridge figure, a former Granada commander who converted\n- The garrison respects Juan and knows his offers are genuine\n\nLet me create a realistic d100 table:\n\nLow rolls (1-20): They're not ready yet - need to actually fight to protect families\nMid-low (21-40): They want to negotiate but need something more - maybe one assault repulsed, or more visible breach\nMid (41-60): They're willing to open discussions but uncertain - need to work out details\nMid-high (61-80): They're ready to negotiate seriously - the breach is enough demonstration\nHigh (81-95): They want to surrender now - ready to discuss terms immediately\nVery high (96-100): Officers come out immediately, desperate to avoid assault\n\nI should make this realistic to medieval siege warfare and the specific emotional/political situation. The breach is significant but not overwhelming yet. They've resisted 10 days. Their original statement was they'd fight \"when we can fight no more\" - is that now, or after an assault attempt?\n \nI recognize the commanders are pragmatic and deeply motivated by family survival. Their decision will balance honor, strategic reality, and familial protection. The probability leans toward negotiation, given their respect for Juan and the increasing vulnerability of their position. They'll seek a solution that demonstrates resistance while minimizing risk to their loved ones.\n\nD100 TABLE: ALHAMA GARRISON RESPONSE TO NEGOTIATION OFFER\n\nContext: Commander Martín approaches under flag of truce after 10 days of bombardment and first major breach. Garrison already explained family hostage situation but promised to surrender \"when we can fight no more.\"\n\nGARRISON RESPONSE TABLE (d100)\n\n1-8: ABSOLUTE REFUSAL\nOfficers refuse to even meet. Shout from walls that they must fight to the end. Family fear has calcified into desperate determination. They will defend the breach regardless of cost. No negotiation possible until after at least one assault attempt repulsed or garrison breaks during assault.\n\n9-18: NOT YET - NEED MORE\nOfficers meet Martín but are apologetic: \"We cannot. Not yet. Ten days of bombardment is not enough to show we resisted properly. We must at least attempt to defend the breach once. If we survive that... then perhaps. But our families... we must be able to say we fought.\" They need blood spilled in actual combat to justify surrender.\n\n19-30: NEED VISIBLE DESPERATION\n\"Give us two more days of bombardment. Let the breach become overwhelming—so large no one could question we had no choice. Then we can negotiate. We need the surrender to look inevitable, not chosen.\" They want the military situation to be so hopeless that even Sultan must accept they had no option.\n\n31-45: CAUTIOUS OPENING\nOfficers willing to talk but deeply anxious. \"What guarantee do our families have? Can you send message to Granada offering prisoner exchange for our families? Or guarantee their safety somehow?\" They want to negotiate but need something—anything—that might protect loved ones before they commit. Long, difficult discussion but not impossible.\n\n46-60: READY TO DISCUSS SERIOUSLY\nOfficers agree to formal negotiation. The breach has demonstrated they resisted properly. \"We will meet tomorrow at dawn. Bring your terms. We need details about how the surrender happens, timing, what we tell our men.\" Professional, pragmatic, but still worried. Need concrete plans to feel safe proceeding.\n\n61-75: RELIEF AND READINESS\nOfficers clearly relieved Juan offered. \"Your Majesty's mercy is known to us. We are ready to negotiate terms now. The breach makes our position clear to anyone who sees it. We have resisted as soldiers should. Now we must think of our men's lives and our families' futures.\" Eager to work out surrender details quickly.\n\n76-85: GRATEFUL ACCEPTANCE\nOfficers practically thank Martín. \"We had hoped Your Majesty might offer terms after seeing the breach. We are ready to surrender under the same terms offered before—safe conduct, choice to stay or leave, protection for those who remain. The breach proves we could not hold. Our families will see we had no choice.\" Want to finalize quickly before more damage.\n\n86-93: IMMEDIATE WILLINGNESS\nOfficers send word within the hour: \"We request formal parley tomorrow morning. Bring written terms. We are prepared to open the gates within two days if terms are acceptable. The breach ends this. We fought with honor. Now we must live with honor.\" Professional eagerness to conclude honorably.\n\n94-97: DESPERATE EAGERNESS\nSenior officers come to the walls immediately. \"Your Majesty, we beg audience tonight if possible. The breach... our men see it. Morale breaking. If we do not surrender soon, we may face mutiny or chaos. Please, let us negotiate now. We accept the terms offered ten days ago. We just need to formalize and arrange the details.\" Fear of losing control of garrison.\n\n98-100: CRISIS POINT\nOfficers emerge from gates within two hours, asking for immediate audience with Juan himself. \"Your Majesty, we must surrender now. The breach has broken our men's will. Some speak of fleeing tonight. Others of fighting to death. We are losing cohesion. If you can accept our surrender tomorrow morning, we can maintain order and dignity. Any longer and this becomes chaos.\" Garrison on verge of collapse.\n\nReady when you are to roll the physical d100.",

The officers send word within the hour that they want formal parley tomorrow morning, are prepared to open gates within two days if terms acceptable, and recognize the breach ends this. They fought with honor and now want to conclude honorably.\n\nThis is a very positive outcome - they're eager but still professional about it. Not desperate/panicking like the 94-97 range, but clearly ready to move forward quickly.\n\nI should:\n1. Describe Martín's approach under flag of truce\n2.

Brief scene showing Juan's reaction and preparation\n6. Keep it relatively short (this is active dialogue/negotiation territory, so I should stop and let the player decide how to handle the actual parley)\n\nThe tone should be: relief on both sides, professional military conduct, recognition that honor has been satisfied, and readiness to conclude this without further bloodshed.\n\nMARTÍN'S APPROACH - MAY 1ST, AFTERNOON\n\nCommander Martín ibn Ahmad rode toward Alhama's gates in the late afternoon light, a white banner streaming above him. Two heralds accompanied him, unarmed and clearly visible. The rubble from the morning's collapse still smoked faintly where dust had yet to settle.\n\nHe stopped fifty yards from the walls and called out in Arabic, his voice carrying clearly: \"I am Commander Martín ibn Ahmad, formerly Yusuf ibn Rashid of Granada, now in service to King Juan of Castile. I come under flag of truce with a message from His Majesty.\"\n\nThere was movement on the walls. Officers gathering. A brief consultation. Then a voice called back: \"We see you, Commander Martín. We remember your name from the old days. Speak your message.\"\n\n\"His Majesty the King asks if you are ready to negotiate terms of surrender. He saw the breach fall this morning. He knows you have resisted with honor—ten days of bombardment, walls broken despite your best efforts. He offers you the dignity of negotiation rather than forcing you to wait for the assault. If you wish to talk, he will meet with your officers tomorrow at dawn under flag of truce. If you are not yet ready, he understands—the bombardment will continue until you are.\"\n\nSilence. Martín could see the officers conferring urgently. One pointed at the breach. Another gestured emphatically. A third seemed to be speaking rapidly, making some argument. The discussion lasted several minutes.\n\nFinally, the lead officer called down: \"Commander Martín, tell His Majesty we will send our response within the hour. We must... consult among ourselves. But tell him we heard his offer. And we appreciate his mercy in making it.\"\n\nMartín bowed from his saddle and rode back to the Castilian lines.\n\nTHE GARRISON'S RESPONSE - EVENING\n\nLess than an hour later, three officers emerged from Alhama's gates under their own white flag. They approached the Castilian forward positions cautiously, stopping at the designated neutral ground.\n\nDon Álvaro met them with Martín as translator. The lead officer—the same commander who had wept over his eight-year-old son ten days earlier—spoke with visible relief tempered by lingering anxiety:\n\n\"We request formal parley with His Majesty tomorrow morning at dawn. We are prepared to discuss terms of surrender. The breach...\" He glanced back at the broken wall. \"The breach makes our position clear to anyone who might judge us. We have resisted as soldiers should resist. We held these walls for ten days against your bombards. No one can say we yielded easily.\"\n\nThe second officer added: \"If the terms His Majesty offers are acceptable—the same terms offered before—we are prepared to open these gates within two days. We need time to explain to our men, to organize the departure of those who wish to leave, to arrange the formalities. But we are ready to conclude this.\"\n\nThe third officer, younger, spoke quietly: \"We fought with honor. Now we must live with honor. The breach ends this siege. There is no shame in surrendering to the inevitable.\"\n\nThe first officer looked directly at Álvaro: \"Please convey to His Majesty: we are grateful he offered terms before forcing the assault. Many lives will be saved tomorrow because of his mercy today. We will meet him at dawn with our decision, but... we believe we can reach agreement.\"\n\nThey bowed formally and returned to their fortress as darkness fell.\n\nJUAN'S TENT - EVENING\n\nÁlvaro delivered the message with barely concealed satisfaction. \"They're ready. Not just willing—eager. The breach broke their resolve exactly as it should. They want to negotiate tomorrow at dawn and are prepared to surrender within two days if terms are acceptable.\"\n\nPietro, standing nearby reviewing his gun logs, nodded approvingly. \"Ten days. Breach on schedule. Surrender before assault. This is how sieges should go when both sides act with sense.\"\n\nInfante Juan, who had been listening quietly, observed: \"Different from Íllora. There, Commander Hamza's pride trapped him. Here, these men's families trapped them—but the breach gave them the excuse they needed. They can tell Granada: 'We held ten days, the wall broke, we had no choice.' It protects them.\"\n\nÁlvaro looked at Juan. \"Your Majesty, what terms do you wish to offer tomorrow? The same as before—safe conduct, choice to stay or leave, protections for those who remain? Or do you wish to adjust anything given their willingness?\"\n\nThe camp settled into evening quiet around them. Somewhere in Alhama, 350 men prepared for tomorrow's negotiation—the end of their siege, one way or another.\n\nWhat do you say? What terms do you wish to offer at tomorrow's parley?",

Have the garrison officers accept the terms\n4. Work out the practical details of the surrender\n5. Show the emotional relief on both sides\n6.

Now it's just working out details.\n\nKeep it relatively short since this is active dialogue/negotiation - stop for Juan to respond if needed. Show the relief and professionalism on both sides.\n\nEVENING PRAYERS - MAY 1ST\n\nIn his tent that evening, Juan knelt before the small traveling altar Fray Hernando had set up. A simple wooden cross, a candle, Isabel's blue ribbon tied around the base. The camp sounds filtered through the canvas—men talking quietly, horses shifting, the distant clang of a smith's hammer.\n\nHe prayed for the men inside those walls. For the officer with the eight-year-old son. For the families held hostage in Granada. For wisdom tomorrow, that the negotiations might end this siege without more blood. For Isabel and their child, far away in Toledo. For the strength to be both merciful and just.\n\nLord, let tomorrow bring peace. Let these men find safety. Let their surrender be honorable. And let their families, somehow, be spared the Sultan's wrath.\n\nHe touched the ribbon gently before rising. Tomorrow would bring an end to this—one way or another.\n\nTHE PARLEY - MAY 2ND, DAWN\n\nThe sun had barely crested the eastern mountains when Juan rode to the designated meeting ground between the siege lines and Alhama's walls. He brought Álvaro, Martín, and Fray Hernando. A white banner hung limply in the still morning air.\n\nFrom Alhama's gates, four officers emerged. The same three from yesterday evening, plus their garrison commander—a grizzled veteran Juan recognized from the negotiations ten days ago. They walked with dignity despite their circumstances, shoulders back, weapons at their sides but clearly ceremonial rather than threatening.\n\nThe two parties met in the middle ground. Juan dismounted out of respect, as he had before.\n\nThe garrison commander bowed. \"Your Majesty. We come to discuss terms of surrender. The breach in our walls makes our position clear. We have resisted for ten days. We can resist no longer with honor.\"\n\nThe officer with the young son added quietly: \"We pray the terms Your Majesty offers are those spoken of ten days ago. Safe conduct for those who wish to leave. Protection for those who choose to remain. No forced conversions. Freedom to practice our faith.\"\n\nJuan spoke clearly: \"The terms I offered then are the terms I offer now. Nothing has changed except the state of your walls. You have fought honorably. You will be treated honorably.\"\n\nHe gestured to Fray Hernando, who stepped forward with a written document—the same terms framework used at Moclín, adapted for Alhama. Martín translated as Fray Hernando read:\n\nTerms of Surrender for Alhama de Granada:\n\nGarrison may depart with personal arms and dignity, escorted safely to Granada territory\n\nAlternatively, garrison members may remain under Castilian rule with full protections\n\nCivilians may choose freely to leave or stay\n\nThose who remain: protection of life, property, and Islamic religious practice\n\nPrivate prayer spaces permitted (not the main mosque, per papal requirements)\n\nNo forced conversions under penalty of papal prohibition\n\nPrisoners taken to Antequera with other captured garrisons, released when crusade concludes\n\nSurrender to occur within 48 hours\n\nThe officers listened intently as Martín translated. When he finished, they conferred quietly in Arabic for several minutes. Juan waited patiently, watching their faces—relief, anxiety, careful calculation, and finally... acceptance.\n\nThe garrison commander turned back to Juan: \"Your Majesty, we accept these terms. We will need today and tomorrow to organize—to explain to our men, to allow those who wish to leave to prepare, to arrange proper turnover of the fortress. We propose: today and tomorrow for preparations, gates open at dawn on May 4th. Is this acceptable?\"\n\nJuan nodded. \"It is acceptable. You have my word: these terms will be honored exactly as written.\"\n\nThe officer with the eight-year-old son spoke, his voice thick: \"Your Majesty... when we return to Granada, when the Sultan asks why we surrendered... we will tell him your bombards broke our walls. That we resisted ten days. That we had no choice.\" He paused. \"We pray this protects our families. We do not know if it will. But we pray.\"\n\nJuan met his eyes. \"I pray the same. You are not surrendering out of cowardice or betrayal. You are surrendering because the wall broke and further resistance would be murder, not defense. Any honest soldier understands this.\"\n\nThe commander bowed deeply. \"Then we have an agreement. May 4th at dawn, the gates of Alhama open to Castile. God's will be done.\"\n\n\"God's will be done,\" Juan repeated.\n\nThe officers returned to their fortress. Juan mounted and rode back to camp, where Álvaro waited with barely concealed triumph.\n\n\"Two weeks total,\" Álvaro said quietly. \"Ten days of bombardment, two days of negotiation, two days of transition. Alhama falls with minimal casualties, garrison treated with honor, and we march on Granada city from a position of total strength. Your Majesty, this is how crusades should be conducted.\"\n\nTHE NEXT TWO DAYS - MAY 2-3\n\nThe fortress prepared for transition. Inside Alhama, the garrison organized itself—some choosing to leave for Granada, others deciding to remain under Castilian rule. Arguments could be heard through the walls as families debated their futures. Packing, farewells, practical arrangements.\n\nIn the Castilian camp, preparations continued. A garrison force was selected—150 men under a reliable commander. Supplies were organized for the transition. Fray Sebastián, who had remained at Moclín as witness, sent word he would come to Alhama as well to help establish the same protections.\n\nOn the evening of May 3rd, Juan stood looking at the fortress. Tomorrow those gates would open. Another fortress secured. Another step closer to Granada city itself.\n\nWhat are your thoughts as you await tomorrow's surrender? And what do you plan to do after Alhama is secured?",

      "text": "Juan called his senior commanders to the command tent—Álvaro, the Master of Calatrava, Infante Juan, Don Fadrique, and Martín. He spread the campaign map across the table.\n\n\"A question for all of you. Once Alhama falls tomorrow, have we not cut Granada off? Look at what we control.\" He traced the territory with his finger. \"We hold the entire western coast—Málaga, Vélez-Málaga, Marbella, all the way down. We control the eastern approach through Alcalá la Real, Íllora, Loja. Now Moclín to the north, Alhama to the west. Do they have any supply routes left? Any ports?\"\n\nMartín leaned over the map, studying it with the eye of someone who had commanded Granada's defenses. He spoke thoughtfully:\n\n\"Your Majesty asks the right question. Let me assess what Granada still controls and what they've lost.\"\n\nHe pointed to the coastal regions: \"Ports: You control Málaga—their primary port. The entire western coast is yours. But...\" He tapped further east. \"They still hold Motril and Salobreña on the southern coast, and Almería to the east. Small ports, but functional. Morocco can still send supplies by sea to these points, then overland to Granada city. Not easy, but possible.\"\n\nHe traced the mountain passes: \"Land routes: The Sierra Nevada mountains provide some protection. There are passes from the south and southeast that Castilian forces don't directly control—difficult terrain, but Granada knows them intimately. Supply caravans can still move through if they're willing to risk guerrilla-style travel.\"\n\nDon Fadrique interjected: \"But those are vulnerable routes. Our cavalry could raid them constantly.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Martín agreed. \"Which brings us to the strategic question.\" He looked at Juan directly. \"Can you strangle Granada without besieging it? Possibly. Here's what you would need to do:\"\n\nÁlvaro pulled out a piece of parchment and began taking notes as Martín outlined the strategy:\n\nSTRANGULATION STRATEGY REQUIREMENTS:\n\n1. Capture or Blockade Remaining Ports\n\nMotril (small port, 15 miles south of Granada)\n\nSalobreña (coastal fortress)\n\nAlmería (further east, major effort)\n\nOr: Naval blockade with Portuguese fleet assistance\n\n2. Take Ring of Fortresses\n\nAlhama (falling tomorrow)\n\nMontefrío (15 miles northwest of Granada)\n\nIznalloz (20 miles north)\n\nSeveral smaller watchtowers and positions\n\n3. Systematic Raiding\n\nDestroy agricultural production in Granada's vega (fertile plain)\n\nCut off mountain supply routes with mobile cavalry\n\nPrevent harvest, mill operations, any food production\n\nMake every supply convoy a deadly gamble\n\n4. Wait\n\nGranada city has perhaps 50,000 civilians\n\nWith no supplies coming in and no food production\n\nStarvation becomes inevitable\n\nTimeline: 6-12 months depending on current stores\n\nThe Master of Calatrava scratched his beard. \"It's feasible. More time-consuming than direct siege, but far fewer casualties. We avoid assaulting those massive walls entirely. Let hunger do the work.\"\n\nInfante Juan added: \"And psychologically—they watch their children starve while we sit safely outside arrow range. Eventually someone opens a gate or kills the Sultan.\"\n\nÁlvaro looked at Juan. \"The 1432 budget we discussed in December assumed exactly this strategy. Taking the ring of fortresses, systematic raiding, strangulation rather than direct assault. It's why we didn't budget for massive siege expenses against Granada's walls.\"\n\nMartín spoke with the authority of someone who knew Granada intimately: \"Your Majesty, I served Granada for twenty years. I know how they think. A direct siege of Granada city would be... extraordinarily costly. Those walls are three times the thickness of anything you've faced. The Alhambra fortress overlooks everything. The garrison would be 8,000-10,000 men fighting for their families and their faith on their home ground. Even with your bombards, it could take months and cost thousands of lives.\"\n\nHe tapped the map. \"But strangulation? If you control the ring of fortresses, blockade or take the southern ports, and raid systematically... Granada cannot feed itself. The Sultan would face a choice: watch his people starve, or negotiate surrender. And hungry people eventually force their leaders' hands.\"\n\nDon Fadrique raised a practical point: \"How long before they're truly desperate? They must have stores.\"\n\nMartín considered. \"They had good harvests last year. With 50,000 mouths to feed and assuming they've been stockpiling since the crusade began... perhaps 4-6 months of supplies if rationed strictly. Add whatever trickles through your blockade... call it 8-12 months before true starvation. But political pressure would build long before that. Hungry children, angry merchants, nobles watching their wealth evaporate—the Sultan's position becomes untenable within 6-8 months.\"\n\nÁlvaro looked at Juan. \"So the strategic question becomes: Do we besiege Granada directly this summer, or do we implement the strangulation plan? Take the remaining fortresses, secure the southern ports or blockade them, raid the vega systematically, and let time do the work through autumn, winter, and into 1433?\"\n\nThe tent fell quiet as the commanders waited for Juan's thoughts on this fundamental strategic choice.\n\nWhat are you thinking? Do you want to pursue the strangulation strategy, or do you have another approach in mind?",

      "text": "Juan is making strategic decisions about the next phase of the campaign. Let me check the current force composition and see if his plan makes sense:\n\nCurrent situation (from Chapter 36 end):\n- Main army at Alhama: 15,800 troops\n- Alhama about to surrender (May 4th, 1432)\n\nJuan's plan:\n1. Infante Juan takes \"a few thousand men\" to capture remaining southern ports (Motril, Salobreña, possibly Almería)\n2. Detach 5,000 from the 20,000 assembling at Jaén to take Montefrío\n3. Remaining 15,000 from Jaén join the main army\n4. Combined force marches on Iznalloz with bombards\n5. Then face Granada and raid systematically\n\nLet me calculate forces:\n- Main army: 15,800 (minus garrison for Alhama, maybe 150) = ~15,650\n- Infante Juan detached: let's say 3,000 for ports\n- Main army after detachment: ~12,650\n- Force to Montefrío: 5,000\n- Force joining from Jaén: 15,000 (20,000 - 5,000)\n- Combined main force: 12,650 + 15,000 = ~27,650\n\nThis is a solid plan. The commanders should analyze it:\n\nStrengths:\n- Simultaneous operations on multiple fronts\n- Uses overwhelming force where needed\n- Ports are smaller targets, don't need full army\n- Montefrío isolated, can be taken with smaller force\n- Main army has massive strength for Iznalloz and Granada operations\n- Timeline is aggressive - could accomplish in a month\n\nPotential concerns:\n- Splitting forces always has risk\n- Are southern ports harder than expected?\n- Is 5,000 enough for Montefrío?\n- Supply lines for multiple operations\n\n- Coordination timing\n\nI see the commanders bringing nuanced perspectives to this strategic approach. Each leader would contribute critical insights - Álvaro's aggressive spirit, Martín's tactical precision, and the Master of Calatrava's logistical expertise would help refine the operational details. Their collective wisdom could identify potential friction points while maintaining the plan's overall momentum.\n\nSTRATEGIC COUNCIL - MAY 3RD, EVENING (CONTINUED)\n\nThe commanders studied the map as Juan outlined his plan. Álvaro's eyes lit up with the kind of energy that came from seeing a bold strategy take shape. Martín leaned closer, tracing the proposed movements with his finger. The Master of Calatrava was already calculating logistics in his head.\n\nÁlvaro spoke first: \"Simultaneous operations on three fronts. Aggressive timeline. Your Majesty, this is ambitious—but feasible. Let me think through the pieces...\"\n\nHe pointed to the coastal region. \"Infante Juan with 3,000 men for the southern ports. Motril is small—perhaps 400 defenders, weak walls. Salobreña is a coastal fortress, more challenging, maybe 600-800 garrison. But these aren't major strongholds like Málaga or Loja. With determination and proper siege craft, two to three weeks each. Call it a month to secure both if he moves quickly.\"\n\nInfante Juan nodded confidently. \"I can do it. Take some of the smaller siege equipment—mangonels, rams. Keep the bombards with the main army where they're needed most. Hit Motril first, secure the closer port, then move on Salobreña.\"\n\nMartín interjected with practical insight: \"Motril will fall quickly—it's a trading town more than a fortress. Salobreña is tougher, built on a rock outcropping over the sea. But it's isolated now, no relief possible. Hunger and bombardment will break them.\" He paused. \"Almería is much further east—30-40 miles past Salobreña. Major fortress, large garrison. That might need to wait for a later campaign, or we simply blockade it with ships.\"\n\n\"Agreed,\" said Álvaro. \"Almería can wait. Motril and Salobreña cut off Granada's primary southern access. That's sufficient for strangulation.\"\n\nHe moved to the next piece. \"Montefrío: 5,000 men from the Jaén force. Montefrío is completely isolated with Íllora in our hands. The garrison there...\" He looked at Martín.\n\nMartín provided the intelligence: \"Perhaps 500-600 defenders. Strong position on high ground, good walls, but not exceptional. With 5,000 troops and proper siege equipment, they cannot hold. Two to three weeks—similar timeline to the ports.\"\n\nThe Master of Calatrava added: \"Five thousand is more than sufficient. That's nearly ten-to-one odds. We can afford to be methodical, keep casualties low, just grind them down with numbers and equipment.\"\n\nÁlvaro continued: \"Which leaves the main thrust—15,000 reinforcements from Jaén join your current army of approximately 12,650 after detachments and garrisons. Combined force: nearly 28,000 troops with all five bombards. March on Iznalloz.\"\n\nHe traced the route on the map. \"Iznalloz is 20 miles north of Granada. Take that, and you've completed the encirclement from the north. Then the main army sits outside Granada itself, raiding the vega systematically while the Sultan watches his food supply burn.\"\n\nMartín spoke thoughtfully: \"Iznalloz is a tough nut. Perhaps 800 defenders, strong position controlling the northern approaches. But 28,000 troops with bombards...\" He shook his head. \"They cannot hold. Two weeks, maybe three. They might try to negotiate once they see the force arrayed against them.\"\n\nDon Fadrique raised a logistical concern: \"Supply lines. We'll have forces operating in three different regions simultaneously. Can our supply network handle that?\"\n\nThe Master of Calatrava responded: \"We control all the conquered territory now—secure roads, established depots. Íllora, Loja, Málaga, Alcalá—these are supply hubs. The Jaén force has its own supply line. The coastal operation is near Málaga, which has excellent port facilities. It's manageable, but we'll need to be disciplined about it.\"\n\nÁlvaro summarized: \"Timeline: June for these operations—Montefrío, the ports, Iznalloz. By early July, Granada is completely encircled. Then we begin the systematic raiding and strangulation. By autumn, they're feeling the pressure. By winter, they're desperate. By spring 1433...\" He smiled grimly. \"Either they're starving and suing for peace, or we decide whether to assault.\"\n\nInfante Juan spoke with determination: \"I can have Motril and Salobreña by the end of June. Give me good commanders and adequate siege equipment.\"\n\nThe Master of Calatrava nodded. \"The logistics work. It's aggressive, but we have the forces and the infrastructure.\"\n\nMartín added his assessment: \"From Granada's perspective, this is their nightmare. They wake up in July and they're completely surrounded, supplies cut off, their vega burning. No relief possible. Sultan Yusuf will have to make a choice: negotiate while he still has leverage, or wait until his people force him to surrender on worse terms.\"\n\nÁlvaro looked at Juan with open approval. \"Your Majesty, this is sound strategy. Bold but achievable. We use our numerical superiority to operate on multiple fronts simultaneously—something Granada cannot counter. By July, the noose is complete. Then patience does the rest.\"\n\nHe paused. \"One question: when do we want these operations to begin? Alhama surrenders tomorrow. Do we immediately detach forces and begin the three-pronged campaign, or do we take a few days to organize properly?\"\n\nThe tent waited for Juan's response. The plan was approved—now it was a matter of timing and final details.\n\nWhat do you say? When do these operations begin, and are there any other details you want to address?",

Do nothing - hope the problem goes away (unrealistic for a ruler)\n2. Negotiate while he still has some leverage\n3. Try a desperate field battle/sortie to break the siege preparations\n4. Request more substantial foreign aid (Morocco, other Muslim powers)\n5. Try to assassinate Juan or key commanders\n6. Attempt to bribe/turn Castilian nobles\n7. Raid Castilian supply lines with guerrillas\n8. Prepare for long siege of Granada city itself\n9. Sue for peace/vassalage to preserve some autonomy\n10. Religious appeal - call for jihad, inspire fanatic resistance\n\nHistorically, Granada rulers in this period were:\n- Pragmatic when facing overwhelming force\n- Concerned with preserving their dynasty\n- Sometimes willing to become vassals rather than lose everything\n- Capable of desperate military gambits\n- Good at playing for time\n- Aware of when they were beaten\n\nThe hostage system is now exposed and morally compromised. His garrison commanders are negotiating despite it. This weakens his internal position.\n\nLet me create a realistic d100 table:\n\nLow rolls: Desperate/aggressive responses (field battle, assassination, jihad call)\n\nMid-low rolls reveal a nuanced approach balancing survival and resistance. I'll explore defensive strategies that maintain some dignity while avoiding total destruction. Guerrilla tactics could disrupt Castilian momentum, and seeking additional aid might provide a lifeline. The goal is to create breathing room and potentially negotiate from a less desperate position.\n\nMid rolls suggest a careful diplomatic dance. Preparing defenses while sending cautious feelers to Castilian leadership shows strategic thinking. I'm weighing the potential for preserving some autonomy against the risk of complete subjugation.\n\nMid-high and high rolls reflect the pragmatic core of Granada's ruling class. Accepting defeat becomes a calculated move to preserve the dynasty and some semblance of power. Negotiating terms becomes an art of survival, seeking the best possible outcome in an increasingly dire situation.\n\nThe ruler must navigate complex psychological terrain - balancing personal honor, religious identity, and dynastic survival against the harsh realities of military defeat. Internal weakness threatens to unravel any remaining strategic options.\n\nD100 TABLE: SULTAN YUSUF IV'S STRATEGIC RESPONSE\n\nContext: Sultan faces imminent complete encirclement. Multiple fortresses fallen or negotiated surrender. Hostage system exposed as tyrannical. Castilian forces preparing three-pronged final offensive. This is the moment he must choose how to respond.\n\nSULTAN'S RESPONSE TABLE (d100)\n\n1-5: DESPERATE FIELD BATTLE\nSultan gathers every available man—perhaps 8,000-9,000 troops from Granada garrison, Moroccan reinforcements, whatever he can scrape together—and marches out to meet Juan's main army before Iznalloz operation begins. Desperate attempt to break Castilian forces in open battle. Catastrophically poor odds but driven by desperation and refusal to accept inevitable defeat. \"Better to die fighting than starve in our walls.\"\n\n6-12: ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT\nSultan dispatches elite assassins to infiltrate Castilian camp and kill Juan, Álvaro, or key commanders. Sends 3-5 highly trained men with inside knowledge of Castilian operations. Extremely risky gambit. If successful, might throw crusade into chaos. If caught, provides Juan with perfect moral justification and enrages Christian forces. Pure desperation move.\n\n7-18: FANATIC RESISTANCE CALL\nSultan issues religious proclamation calling for jihad and fanatic resistance. Offers paradise to defenders, threatens hell to anyone who surrenders. Orders execution of family members of officers who negotiated at Moclín and Alhama to terrify others into obedience. Doubles down on hostage system despite its exposure. Brutal but potentially effective short-term at stiffening resistance. Destroys any remaining moral authority.\n\n19-28: AGGRESSIVE GUERRILLA CAMPAIGN\nSultan organizes systematic guerrilla warfare against all three Castilian operations. Sends 1,500-2,000 light cavalry to raid supply lines, harass siege camps, attack foraging parties. Tries to make every Castilian operation costly and slow. Can't prevent encirclement but might delay it and inflict casualties. Professional military response but insufficient to change strategic outcome.\n\n29-40: DESPERATE DIPLOMATIC APPEAL\nSultan sends urgent embassies to Morocco, Tunis, Egypt, and other Muslim powers begging for substantial military aid. Offers territorial concessions, trade advantages, political alliances. Argues that Granada's fall means all of Al-Andalus lost to Christendom. Appeals to religious duty and political interest. Realistic chance of getting promises, but actual aid unlikely to arrive in time or in sufficient force.\n\n41-52: FORTIFY AND DELAY\nSultan abandons outlying fortresses to their fate, concentrates all available forces in Granada city itself. Stockpiles food aggressively, fortifies walls further, prepares for long siege. Hopes that expensive siege of Granada's massive fortifications will exhaust Castilian will and resources. Banks on crusade losing momentum. Passive but rational—makes Juan pay maximum price for final victory.\n\n53-65: CAUTIOUS DIPLOMATIC FEELERS\nSultan sends unofficial envoy (not formal embassy) to test whether Juan would accept anything short of complete conquest. Explores possibilities: vassal status? Tribute? Limited territory retention? Doesn't commit to anything but wants to understand what terms might be available. Keeps options open while preparing militarily. Pragmatic hedging.\n\n66-76: CONDITIONAL NEGOTIATION OFFER\nSultan sends formal embassy proposing negotiations \"under appropriate conditions.\" Willing to discuss vassalage or territorial concessions but insists on preserving Granada city itself and his rule there. Offers substantial tribute, acknowledgment of Castilian suzerainty, return of some conquered territory. Trying to preserve something from the wreckage. Realistic enough to negotiate but still hoping to save his throne.\n\n77-85: PRAGMATIC PEACE OVERTURE\nSultan recognizes the military situation is hopeless. Sends high-ranking embassy offering serious negotiations for honorable surrender. Willing to discuss: vassalage with autonomy, guaranteed rule for his dynasty, protection for Granada's Muslims, reasonable tribute arrangements. Professional acceptance that he's lost but trying to get best terms possible. Still has some leverage—his 10,000 troops and Granada's walls—so negotiates from that.\n\n86-92: DYNASTIC PRESERVATION BID\nSultan offers to abdicate in favor of a family member more acceptable to Castile if it preserves the Nasrid dynasty in some form. Proposes his son or brother rule as Castilian vassal with Granada city as reduced autonomous emirate. Complete pragmatism—accepts military defeat, just wants family to survive with something. Shows he understands he personally is finished but dynasty might continue.\n\n93-96: FULL SURRENDER NEGOTIATION\nSultan sends embassy proposing complete surrender terms: he abdicates, leaves for Morocco or North Africa with wealth and family, Granada peacefully transfers to Castilian control, civilian population guaranteed protections. Essentially offering to hand over everything cleanly in exchange for safe exile and civilian protections. Total pragmatic acceptance of defeat. Wants to end this before more people die and before starvation makes terms worse.\n\n97-99: DESPERATE ABDICATION\nSultan recognizes position is hopeless and he's personally discredited (hostage system, military defeats, losing support). Abdicates immediately, flees to Morocco with whatever wealth he can carry, leaves Granada's ruling council to negotiate surrender. Saves himself, abandons his people, but ends the war quickly. Cowardly but pragmatic from personal survival standpoint. Granada left leaderless and more likely to negotiate quickly.\n\n100: INTERNAL COUP\nGranada's nobles/garrison commanders, seeing the inevitable and disgusted with hostage system, stage internal coup. Arrest or kill Sultan Yusuf, install new ruler or ruling council, immediately send peace embassy to Juan. \"We have removed the obstacle to peace. We wish to negotiate Granada's future on better terms.\" Revolutionary but not unprecedented—desperate cities sometimes remove failed leaders to save themselves.\n\nKey Variables Affecting Response:\n\nMilitary Reality: Completely surrounded, no relief possible\n\nInternal Position: Hostage system exposed as tyrannical, losing garrison loyalty\n\nPersonality: Granada sultans historically varied from fanatic to pragmatic\n\nDynasty Concerns: Preserving Nasrid family vs. personal survival\n\nReligious Duty: Jihad obligation vs. responsibility to spare civilians suffering\n\nTime Factor: Every week makes position worse as encirclement completes\n\nReady when you are to roll the physical d100.",

Lower rolls mean guerrilla harassment significantly impacts operations; higher rolls mean the overwhelming force advantage carries the day despite harassment.\n\nD100 TABLE: THREE-PRONGED JUNE OFFENSIVE SUCCESS\n\nContext: Three simultaneous operations (Coastal ports, Montefrío, Iznalloz) while Sultan launches aggressive guerrilla campaign with 1,500-2,000 light cavalry raiding supply lines and harassing operations.\n\nSUCCESS/FAILURE FACTORS\n\nSUCCESS FACTORS:\n\nOverwhelming numerical superiority (36,000 total troops vs. ~2,500 combined fortress garrisons)\n\nFive proven bombards with experienced crews\n\nVeteran commanders and troops from 1431-32 campaigns\n\nSecure base territory with established supply depots\n\nHigh morale from recent victories (Íllora, Moclín, Alhama)\n\nClear strategic plan with realistic timelines\n\nEnemy fortresses isolated, no relief possible\n\nProfessional siege craft and organization\n\nFAILURE FACTORS:\n\nThree simultaneous operations strain coordination and supply\n\nSultan's guerrilla force (1,500-2,000 cavalry) actively harassing all fronts\n\nExtended supply lines vulnerable to raiding\n\nJune weather (potential storms or oppressive heat)\n\nCommunication delays between separated forces\n\nEquipment strain from continuous siege operations\n\nDisease risk with armies in field during summer\n\nSome targets genuinely challenging (Salobreña's coastal fortress, Iznalloz's strong position)\n\nGarrison morale may stiffen with Sultan's aggressive stance\n\nCAMPAIGN OUTCOME TABLE (d100)\n\n1-8: CATASTROPHIC SETBACKS\nGuerrilla campaign devastates operations. Major supply convoys destroyed, multiple siege camps raided with heavy casualties (200+ dead), one bombard damaged beyond field repair in guerrilla attack. Coastal force bogged down at Motril for 3+ weeks. Montefrío operations stalled. Iznalloz barely begun. Timeline extends into August. Morale severely damaged. Strategic plan in jeopardy.\n\n9-18: SEVERE COMPLICATIONS\nGuerrillas inflict serious damage across all fronts. Supply difficulties delay operations by 2-3 weeks. 100-150 casualties from raids. One operation (coastal or Montefrío) suffers major setback requiring reinforcement. Iznalloz siege proceeds slowly. By end of June, only 1 of 3 objectives achieved. Encirclement incomplete. Sultan's strategy working better than expected.\n\n19-30: SIGNIFICANT DELAYS\nGuerrilla harassment causes persistent problems. Supply raids force stronger escorts, slowing operations. 60-80 casualties from skirmishes. All three operations proceed but behind schedule by 10-14 days. Motril falls but Salobreña resists. Montefrío under siege but not fallen. Iznalloz bombardment just beginning. Encirclement delayed into July. Frustrating but not disastrous.\n\n31-45: MIXED RESULTS\nOperations proceed with moderate guerrilla interference. Supply lines harassed but functional with heavy escorts. 40-50 casualties from raids. Coastal force takes Motril, besieging Salobreña. Montefrío under serious pressure. Iznalloz bombardment underway. Timeline slips 5-7 days but generally on track. Two objectives partially complete by month's end. Acceptable progress despite complications.\n\n46-60: STANDARD PROGRESS DESPITE HARASSMENT\nGuerrillas harass but don't significantly disrupt operations. Strong escorts limit supply damage. 25-35 casualties from skirmishes. Motril falls within 10 days. Montefrío walls breached by month's end. Iznalloz under effective bombardment. Timeline roughly maintained. Encirclement 75% complete by early July. Professional execution overcomes harassment through superior numbers and organization.\n\n61-73: STRONG EXECUTION\nOperations proceed efficiently despite guerrilla attempts. Cavalry screens effectively counter raiders. 15-25 casualties from minor skirmishes. Motril falls quickly, Salobreña under serious siege. Montefrío near surrender. Iznalloz bombardment ahead of schedule. By end of June, two fortresses secured, third nearly complete. Encirclement essentially achieved. Sultan's guerrilla strategy proves insufficient against overwhelming force.\n\n74-84: EXCELLENT COORDINATION\nAll three operations execute smoothly. Aggressive counter-guerrilla operations limit raiding effectiveness. 10-15 casualties from scattered encounters. Motril secured in 8 days, Salobreña breached by month's end. Montefrío surrenders after negotiations. Iznalloz walls cracking under bombardment. Encirclement complete or nearly complete by late June. Professional, efficient campaign despite enemy interference.\n\n85-92: EXCEPTIONAL PERFORMANCE\nOperations exceed expectations. Coordinated cavalry sweeps catch and maul guerrilla forces (50+ enemy casualties), reducing harassment. Minimal friendly casualties (5-10). Motril secured in 6 days, Salobreña negotiates surrender mid-month. Montefrío falls after quick bombardment. Iznalloz under heavy pressure, garrison demoralized. By June's end, three fortresses secured, fourth (Iznalloz) days from surrender. Complete encirclement achieved ahead of schedule.\n\n93-97: DEVASTATING SUCCESS\nSultan's guerrilla force intercepted and destroyed in major engagement (100+ enemy casualties, force broken). All three operations proceed unhindered. Negligible casualties (3-5). Motril surrenders after show of force. Salobreña falls mid-June. Montefrío negotiates immediate surrender. Iznalloz garrison, seeing the pattern, requests terms before bombardment seriously damages walls. All four objectives achieved by June 25th. Granada completely isolated. Morale soaring. Strategic masterpiece.\n\n98-100: MIRACULOUS TRIUMPH\nPerfect coordination and enemy collapse. Guerrilla force destroyed in ambush (150+ casualties, remnants flee). All fortresses fall with minimal resistance—garrisons recognize futility after Alhama's example. Motril, Salobreña, Montefrío all surrender within 2 weeks. Iznalloz requests terms immediately upon seeing main army approach. Zero significant Castilian casualties. All objectives achieved by June 20th. Granada completely encircled with massive army sitting outside ready to begin systematic raiding. Sultan's position hopeless. Historical achievement.\n\nTimeline Reference: Operations begin early May after Alhama secured. Table covers May-June period for all three operations plus main army positioning outside Granada.\n\nReady when you are to roll the physical d100.",

      "text": "Oh no, a critical failure - rolled a 1. This is the catastrophic setback result. Let me draft what happens based on the table:\n\n**1-8: CATASTROPHIC SETBACKS**\nGuerrilla campaign devastates operations. Major supply convoys destroyed, multiple siege camps raided with heavy casualties (200+ dead), one bombard damaged beyond field repair in guerrilla attack. Coastal force bogged down at Motril for 3+ weeks. Montefrío operations stalled. Iznalloz barely begun. Timeline extends into August. Morale severely damaged. Strategic plan in jeopardy.\n\nThis is going to be a serious blow. I need to narrate this realistically and historically - show how guerrilla warfare can devastate even a superior force when they're spread too thin across multiple objectives. The Sultan's aggressive response (from the roll of 24) is working devastatingly well.\n\nI should:\n1. Show the initial confidence and deployment\n2. Narrate how the guerrilla campaign systematically disrupts all three operations\n3. Detail specific disasters - supply convoys destroyed, camps raided, the bombard damage\n4. Show the cascading effects on morale and timeline\n5. Stop when Juan needs to make a decision about how to respond\n\nThis is a major setback but not a campaign-ender. Juan still has overwhelming force, but his aggressive timeline is shattered and he's taken significant casualties. This will test his leadership.\n\nTHE JUNE OFFENSIVE BEGINS - MAY 4-10, 1432\n\nThe gates of Alhama opened at dawn on May 4th as promised. The surrender proceeded with dignity—garrison members filing out, some heading south under escort to Granada, others remaining under Castilian protection. Juan's 150-man garrison marched in. Another fortress secured. Another step toward victory.\n\nBy May 8th, the three-pronged offensive was underway:\n\nInfante Juan departed south with 3,200 troops, siege equipment, and high spirits, heading for Motril and the coastal ports.\n\nDon García López de Padilla marched north with 5,000 men from the Jaén force to invest Montefrío, the isolated fortress that should fall easily to overwhelming numbers.\n\nJuan's main army—now swollen to 27,500 troops with the arrival of 15,000 reinforcements from Jaén—prepared to march on Iznalloz with all five bombards. The plan was bold, aggressive, and built on a year of successful operations.\n\nThe confidence in the camps was palpable. Officers spoke of completing the encirclement by July. Veterans from the 1431 campaign shared stories of fallen fortresses. The new recruits from Jaén were eager, well-equipped, ready to finish what their comrades had started.\n\nTHE GUERRILLA STORM - MAY 11-15\n\nThe first sign of trouble came on May 11th. A supply convoy heading to Don García's force at Montefrío—60 wagons with food, arrows, rope, and siege equipment—simply never arrived. When scouts rode out to investigate, they found the convoy three miles from Montefrío: wagons burned, 40 teamsters and 25 escort soldiers dead, supplies scattered and destroyed. Hoofprints everywhere. A professional ambush.\n\nThe raiders were gone before reinforcements could arrive.\n\nOn May 13th, Infante Juan's coastal force, having just begun investing Motril, was hit at dawn. Two hundred Moorish light cavalry swept through the northern edge of his camp, killing sentries, setting fire to supply tents, and vanishing into the hills before his heavy cavalry could respond. Twelve dead, twenty wounded, and—worst of all—three days of food supplies burned.\n\nThe same day, Juan's main army, marching toward Iznalloz with the ponderous bombards, found itself harassed constantly. Light cavalry appeared on ridges, fired arrows into the column, and melted away. Foraging parties sent out for food returned with enemy cavalry on their heels—or didn't return at all. The march slowed to a crawl, the army forced into defensive formations.\n\nBy May 15th, the pattern was clear: Sultan Yusuf had unleashed a coordinated guerrilla campaign across all three fronts. Perhaps 1,500-2,000 light cavalry, operating in bands of 50-200, hitting supply lines, raiding camps, making every movement dangerous and exhausting.\n\nTHE DISASTERS COMPOUND - MAY 16-25\n\nCoastal Front (Infante Juan):\n\nMotril proved far more difficult than expected. The small fortress resisted fiercely, and the siege camp faced constant harassment. On May 18th, a major night raid killed 35 men and destroyed two mangonels. Supply difficulties forced Infante Juan to send increasingly large escorts—800 men just to protect a convoy from Málaga—which drained his offensive capacity.\n\nBy May 25th, Motril's walls remained intact, Salobreña was untouched, and Infante Juan's force had suffered 80+ casualties without taking a single objective. He sent increasingly frustrated dispatches: \"Every supply convoy ambushed. Cannot maintain siege operations under these conditions. Need reinforcements or must withdraw.\"\n\nMontefrío Front (Don García):\n\nDon García arrived at Montefrío with 5,000 men and began siege operations. But the supply situation became catastrophic. Three major convoys destroyed in ambush. By May 22nd, his army was on half-rations. When he tried to forage locally, his parties were cut to pieces by waiting cavalry.\n\nOn May 24th, a massive guerrilla raid—perhaps 400 cavalry—struck his camp at night during a rainstorm. The attack was devastatingly professional: simultaneous assaults on multiple points, fires set in supply areas, systematic targeting of officers' tents. Forty-three men killed, seventy wounded, including two senior captains. The siege equipment—rams and towers under construction—were burned.\n\nDon García's dispatch was grim: \"Cannot sustain operations. Food for six days. Equipment destroyed. Guerrillas control countryside. Montefrío garrison reinforced and resupplied during chaos. Request permission to withdraw to Íllora to regroup.\"\n\nMain Army Front (Juan's Force):\n\nThe worst disaster struck Juan's main column on May 20th. The five bombards, moving slowly on their massive carriages, required the roads be cleared and reinforced. The column stretched for miles. Despite heavy escorts, a precisely coordinated guerrilla assault hit the artillery train in a narrow mountain pass.\n\nThree hundred cavalry struck from two directions simultaneously. The escorts fought bravely, but in the confined terrain, chaos erupted. When the dust settled and the raiders withdrew:\n\n58 men dead, including Master Gunner Pietro Calabrese's assistant, Giulio\n\nOne bombard's carriage shattered beyond field repair when panicked oxen bolted and overturned it on rocky ground\n\nThe bombard itself cracked—a fracture running six inches along the barrel. Not destroyed, but unusable without major repairs in a proper foundry\n\nSubstantial gunpowder contaminated when water barrels burst during the chaos\n\nTransport oxen scattered—40 animals lost, slowing the entire column further\n\nPietro stood before the damaged weapon with a face like stone, then turned to report to Juan: \"Your Majesty. We have four operational bombards. This one...\" He gestured at the cracked barrel. \"Firing it would kill the crew. It needs to go back to Jaén or Toledo for complete refounding. Months of work. The carriage can be rebuilt here, but the barrel... that's a foundry job.\"\n\nThe main army, which had hoped to reach Iznalloz by May 18th, was still 15 miles away on May 25th, crawling through hostile territory with constant harassment.\n\nTHE GRIM ACCOUNTING - MAY 25TH EVENING\n\nJuan's command tent outside the village of Pinos Puente—still miles from Iznalloz—was thick with tension. All three fronts had sent dispatches. Álvaro de Luna spread the reports across the table, his face grave.\n\n\"Your Majesty. The situation.\"\n\nCasualties (May 11-25):\n\nCoastal force: 82 dead, 60 wounded\n\nMontefrío force: 71 dead, 95 wounded\n\nMain army: 73 dead, 52 wounded\n\nTotal: 226 dead, 207 wounded\n\nOperational Status:\n\nCoastal force: Bogged down at Motril, no progress, requesting reinforcements\n\nMontefrío force: Siege stalled, equipment destroyed, requesting permission to withdraw\n\nMain army: Four operational bombards instead of five, 10-12 days behind schedule\n\nNone of the three objectives achieved. Timeline in ruins.\n\nSupply Situation:\n\nAt least eight major convoys destroyed or turned back\n\nAll three forces on reduced rations\n\nForaging extremely dangerous\n\nSupply escorts now require 500-800 men each, draining combat strength\n\nEnemy Effectiveness:\n\nSultan's guerrilla force operating with devastating coordination\n\nPerhaps 1,500-2,000 light cavalry in multiple independent bands\n\nProfessional leadership, excellent intelligence, perfect knowledge of terrain\n\nInflicting 10:1 casualty ratios in raids before withdrawing\n\nMorale Impact:\n\nNew recruits from Jaén rattled by constant harassment\n\nVeterans frustrated by inability to bring enemy to decisive battle\n\nOfficers questioning whether three-front strategy is sustainable\n\nMen exhausted from constant alert status and inadequate food\n\nThe Master of Calatrava spoke bluntly: \"Your Majesty, we tried to do too much at once. Spreading 36,000 men across three fronts gave the Sultan's cavalry room to operate. They're not strong enough to face any one of our armies in battle—but they're devastating against our supply lines and isolated forces.\"\n\nDon Fadrique added: \"We need to concentrate. Either reinforce one front heavily enough to overwhelm the guerrillas there, or pull back and regroup entirely. This halfway approach is bleeding us.\"\n\nÁlvaro's analysis was cold and strategic: \"The June timeline is impossible now. We've taken nearly 450 casualties, lost a bombard, and achieved nothing. If we continue on current trajectory, we're looking at August before encirclement completes—and hundreds more dead from guerrilla warfare rather than decisive battles.\"\n\nA messenger arrived from Infante Juan's coastal force, mud-spattered and exhausted. He bowed quickly: \"Your Majesty. The Infante requests urgent guidance. Another convoy ambushed yesterday. Motril still holds. He asks: reinforce him, or should he withdraw to Málaga?\"\n\nThe tent fell silent. Outside, the camp was nervous—men on edge from three weeks of constant harassment, inadequate food, and no visible progress. The bold three-pronged offensive had crashed into the reality of guerrilla warfare.\n\nJuan stood looking at the map, at the three fronts marked in red, at the captured territory marked in blue, and at Granada city sitting in the middle—still unreached, still defiant, its Sultan's guerrilla strategy working devastatingly well.\n\nWhat do you do?",

Maintaining the two sieges (Montefrío and Iznalloz)\n4. Deploying his own cavalry raiding parties\n5. Burning crops to deny Granada food\n6. Hunting their supply convoys\n\nHis question about where the guerrillas operate from is excellent. Let me think about this historically and strategically:\n\n**Potential Guerrilla Bases:**\n- Granada city itself (obviously)\n- The Sierra Nevada mountains - vast, difficult terrain\n- Remaining small fortresses and watchtowers not yet captured\n- Villages still under Granada control\n- The southern ports (Motril, Salobreña, Almería) that haven't fallen\n\nGiven what we've established:\n- Castile controls: Málaga, western coast, Alcalá, Íllora, Loja, Moclín, Alhama\n- Granada still controls: Granada city, Iznalloz (under siege), Montefrío (under siege), Motril, Salobreña, Almería, and probably various smaller positions\n\nMartín would know this best - he commanded Granada's forces.\n\nJuan's strategy shift makes sense:\n- Stop trying to do three things at once\n- Use his cavalry advantage for raiding\n- Deny Granada food through systematic crop destruction\n- Continue pressure on the two sieges already started\n- Make the guerrillas come to him defending supply convoys rather than hunting his\n\nThis is actually a more historically appropriate medieval response - raiding and devastation were standard siege warfare tactics.\n\nLet me have the commanders react to this plan and Martín provide intelligence on where the guerrillas are operating from.\n\nSTRATEGIC COUNCIL - MAY 25TH, NIGHT\n\nJuan's voice cut through the tension: \"We withdraw Infante Juan. Consolidate the forces. We tried to do too much at once—the Sultan proved that.\"\n\nHe pointed at the map. \"But we change approach. We have cavalry—thousands of horsemen. We deploy them as the Sultan does: raiding parties, independent operations, living off the land. They hunt every convoy going to Granada. They burn every field, every mill, every crop. Granada will not harvest this year.\"\n\nÁlvaro leaned forward, catching the shift in strategy.\n\nJuan continued: \"We maintain the two sieges we've started—Montefrío and Iznalloz. But we stop trying to supply massive field armies through hostile territory. Instead, our cavalry makes the countryside impossible for Granada to use. They cannot hold out indefinitely. Eventually they starve, or they come out to face us in open battle where we destroy them.\"\n\nHe looked at Martín directly. \"But I need to know: where are these guerrillas operating from? They should have no bases left except Granada itself. Where do they supply from? Where do they rest? Where are their staging points?\"\n\nMartín stepped to the map, his expression thoughtful. He began marking positions:\n\n\"Your Majesty asks the essential question. Let me show you Granada's remaining infrastructure.\"\n\nGRANADA'S REMAINING TERRITORY:\n\n1. Granada City Itself\n\"Obviously their primary base. Perhaps 8,000-10,000 garrison troops, plus these 1,500-2,000 light cavalry raiders. The city has extensive stables, supply depots, everything needed to support mobile operations. The guerrillas can ride out, raid, and return in 2-3 days.\"\n\n2. Mountain Refuges (Sierra Nevada)\n\"The mountains south and east of Granada.\" He traced the high terrain. \"Dozens of small villages, shepherd huts, cave systems. Not fortresses, but places where cavalry bands can rest, change horses, cache supplies. Very difficult terrain for your heavy cavalry to patrol effectively. The locals know every path.\"\n\n3. Iznalloz (Under Siege)\n\"You're besieging it now, but until it falls, it's a forward base. The garrison can provide food, fresh horses, intelligence to raiding parties. Once Iznalloz falls, the guerrillas lose a critical northern staging point.\"\n\n4. Montefrío (Under Siege)\n\"Same situation. Still holding out, still providing support to raiders in that region. These two fortresses are anchors for the guerrilla network.\"\n\n5. Southern Ports (Motril, Salobreña, Almería)\n\"Still in Granada's hands. Moroccan supply ships can reach them. Supplies move overland to Granada city. These are lifelines—not just for food and weapons, but for the morale of knowing help can still arrive.\"\n\n6. Smaller Positions\nHe marked several points. \"Perhaps six to eight small watchtowers, fortified villages, minor positions scattered through the territory. Each one: maybe 30-50 men, but they provide eyes, warning systems, and rest points for raiders. Collectively they form a network.\"\n\n7. The Alpujarras Region\n\"South of Granada, in the foothills approaching the southern coast. Rugged, Muslim-populated valleys. Not fortified in the conventional sense, but very hostile territory for Christian forces. The population supports the Sultan. Guerrillas can operate there almost freely.\"\n\nDon Fadrique studied the map. \"So the guerrillas aren't operating from nowhere. They have Granada city as a massive base, two major fortresses we're besieging, southern ports still open, mountain refuges, and a network of small positions. That's... substantial infrastructure.\"\n\nThe Master of Calatrava nodded slowly. \"Which means Your Majesty's strategy is exactly right. We can't hunt them in the mountains—that's their terrain. But we can destroy their supply network. Every convoy they try to bring from the southern ports, we intercept. Every field they try to harvest, we burn. We make it impossible for Granada to feed itself, which makes it impossible for them to sustain these raiding operations.\"\n\nMartín added his professional assessment: \"The guerrilla cavalry needs: grain for horses, food for men, arrows and equipment, fresh mounts when theirs tire. Right now they're getting all that from Granada city, supplemented by the southern ports. If you cut off the ports or make the supply routes deadly, and if you systematically destroy the crops in Granada's vega...\" He shook his head. \"By August, those raiders become increasingly desperate. By September, their horses are starving. By October, the Sultan has to choose: use his cavalry for defending food supplies rather than raiding yours, or watch them become ineffective.\"\n\nÁlvaro was already thinking through the operational details. \"So: Order Infante Juan to withdraw from Motril back to Málaga. That's 3,200 troops we can redeploy. We send perhaps 2,000 of them to reinforce Don García at Montefrío—give him overwhelming force to crush that siege quickly. The other 1,200 join the main army here.\"\n\nHe continued: \"Meanwhile, we organize our cavalry—perhaps 4,000-5,000 horsemen total—into raiding companies of 200-300 each. Give them simple orders: burn every field in Granada's vega, intercept every supply convoy from the south, make the countryside a wasteland. They operate independently, living off what they take, avoiding major engagements with enemy raiders.\"\n\nDon Fadrique added: \"And we continue pressing Iznalloz with the main army and four bombards. Once Iznalloz falls, the northern guerrilla operations become much harder for them. Once Montefrío falls, the western approaches are closed. Squeeze them systematically.\"\n\nThe Master of Calatrava raised a practical concern: \"The crop burning—that's brutal work. We're talking about destroying food that civilians need. The vega feeds perhaps 40,000-50,000 people. We burn those fields, we're condemning them to hunger.\"\n\nHe paused. \"I'm not objecting, Your Majesty. That's medieval siege warfare. Starvation is a weapon. But we should be clear-eyed about what we're ordering: systematic devastation that will kill through hunger, including women and children. It's effective. It's also... harsh.\"\n\nFray Hernando, who had been listening quietly, spoke with careful theological precision: \"The Church recognizes starvation as a legitimate siege tactic when it serves to bring a just war to swifter conclusion, thereby saving lives that would be lost in prolonged conflict. But there is a moral obligation to offer terms—to give the Sultan opportunity to surrender before his people starve. The destruction must serve military necessity, not cruelty for its own sake.\"\n\nThe tent was quiet for a moment.\n\nÁlvaro looked at Juan. \"Your Majesty, the strategy is sound. Withdraw Infante Juan, reinforce the two sieges, deploy cavalry for systematic raiding and crop destruction, strangle Granada's supply lines. It's the correct response to the Sultan's guerrilla campaign. But we should clarify: Do you want to offer terms to Granada before we begin the devastation? Or do we proceed with the raiding and burning, and let the Sultan come to us when he's desperate enough?\"\n\nOutside, the camp waited—nervous, frustrated, but still 27,000 strong and capable of executing whatever strategy their king chose.\n\nWhat do you order?",

      "text": "Alright, so Juan is consolidating forces, withdrawing from the coastal offensive, and shifting to a starvation/raiding strategy. The plan is:\n\n1. Withdraw Infante Juan from Motril (3,200 troops)\n2. Reinforce Montefrío siege (adding ~2,000 troops for overwhelming force)\n3. Continue Iznalloz siege with main army and 4 bombards\n4. Deploy 4,000-5,000 cavalry in independent raiding companies (200-300 each)\n5. Systematic crop burning in Granada's vega\n6. Intercept supply convoys from southern ports\n7. Strangle Granada through starvation rather than direct assault\n\nThis is a shift from trying to complete encirclement quickly to accepting a longer timeline but with less vulnerability to guerrilla warfare. The cavalry raids are decentralized, don't need supply lines, and can counter the Sultan's guerrilla tactics.\n\nFor the d100 table, I need to consider:\n\nSUCCESS FACTORS:\n- Massive cavalry superiority (4,000-5,000 vs. 1,500-2,000 enemy raiders)\n- Decentralized raiding doesn't need vulnerable supply convoys\n- Granada's vega is accessible and rich target for burning\n- Two sieges now heavily reinforced and harder to disrupt\n- Strategy plays to Castilian strengths (numbers, resources)\n- Timeline pressure now on Granada, not Castile\n- Sultan must choose: defend crops or raid enemies\n- Devastating to civilian morale and food supplies\n\nFAILURE FACTORS:\n- June/July is harvest season - race against time to burn crops before harvest\n- Granada's light cavalry still has mobility advantage\n- Mountain refuges provide safe havens for enemy raiders\n- Southern ports still open (Motril, Salobreña, Almería)\n- Systematic burning is slow work, requires extensive coordination\n- Enemy can prioritize defending most critical fields\n- Weather (summer storms could delay burning operations)\n\nI'll need to carefully weigh the ethical implications of targeting civilian populations while recognizing the strategic necessity of breaking Granada's resistance. The potential for guerrilla fighters to protect critical supply routes remains a significant concern, potentially undermining the entire campaign's effectiveness. Creating a nuanced d100 table will require balancing the strategic objectives with the unpredictable nature of warfare and civilian resilience.\n\nD100 TABLE: CONSOLIDATION & STARVATION STRATEGY (JUNE-JULY 1432)\n\nContext: Withdrawal from Motril, reinforcement of two sieges, deployment of 4,000-5,000 cavalry in independent raiding companies for crop burning and convoy interdiction. Sultan still has 1,500-2,000 guerrilla cavalry plus two fortresses (Iznalloz, Montefrío) still holding.\n\nSUCCESS/FAILURE FACTORS\n\nSUCCESS FACTORS:\n\nOverwhelming cavalry numerical superiority (3:1 ratio)\n\nDecentralized raiding requires no vulnerable supply lines\n\nGranada's vega is rich agricultural target (thousands of acres)\n\nTwo sieges now heavily reinforced, harder to disrupt\n\nTimeline pressure shifts to Granada (must harvest or starve)\n\nStrategy forces Sultan to defend rather than raid\n\nCastilian cavalry can live off captured/destroyed resources\n\nMultiple independent companies mean losing one doesn't collapse strategy\n\nFAILURE FACTORS:\n\nJune-July is harvest season—race against time to burn before crops collected\n\nEnemy light cavalry retains mobility advantage in mountains\n\nSouthern ports (Motril, Salobreña) still supply Granada\n\nSystematic crop burning is slow, methodical work requiring weeks\n\nEnemy can prioritize defending most critical agricultural zones\n\nGuerrillas might successfully escort critical supply convoys\n\nWeather: summer storms could hamper burning operations\n\nMoral weight of starvation affecting troops' willingness to burn thoroughly\n\nTwo sieges still face determined resistance\n\nCAMPAIGN OUTCOME TABLE (d100)\n\n1-6: COMPLETE STRATEGIC FAILURE\nSultan's guerrillas adapt brilliantly. They mass 800+ cavalry to crush isolated Castilian raiding parties (120+ Castilian cavalry dead in ambushes). Remaining raiders forced into defensive posture. Granada successfully harvests 60-70% of crops under heavy guard. Supply convoys from south get through with acceptable losses. Both sieges harassed so effectively that Montefrío and Iznalloz hold firm. By end July: 200+ additional casualties, minimal crop damage, no fortresses taken, Granada's position barely weakened. Strategy failed.\n\n7-15: SEVERE SETBACKS\nGuerrillas maul several raiding parties badly (80-100 cavalry casualties). Crop burning proceeds slowly—only 20-30% destroyed before Granada harvests rest under guard. Major supply convoy from Motril reaches Granada with Moroccan reinforcements and food. Montefrío repulses assault attempt (60 casualties). Iznalloz walls damaged but holding. By end July: 180+ casualties, Granada adequately supplied through autumn, sieges stalled. Strategy largely ineffective.\n\n16-27: DISAPPOINTING RESULTS\nRaiding campaign faces stiff resistance. 50-70 cavalry casualties in skirmishes. Crop burning achieves 30-40% destruction—significant but not crippling. Several supply convoys intercepted but others get through. Montefrío siege progressing slowly. Iznalloz under bombardment but no breach yet. By end July: moderate crop damage, Granada can sustain itself through autumn with rationing, one fortress might fall by August. Limited success.\n\n28-42: MIXED OUTCOMES\nRaiding produces uneven results. 30-45 cavalry casualties. Crop burning destroys 40-50% of vega harvest—painful for Granada but survivable. Some supply convoys intercepted, others reach city. Montefrío walls breached, garrison negotiating. Iznalloz under heavy bombardment, walls cracking. By end July: Granada facing food difficulties by winter but not immediate crisis, one fortress fallen or falling, pressure mounting but not decisive.\n\n43-58: MODERATE SUCCESS\nRaiding campaign effective despite resistance. 20-30 cavalry casualties. Systematic burning destroys 50-60% of crops—serious blow to Granada's food security. Most supply convoys from south intercepted or turned back. Montefrío surrenders mid-July after breach. Iznalloz walls breached late July, garrison considering terms. By end July: Granada facing genuine food shortages by autumn, two fortresses taken or negotiating, strategy working as intended.\n\n59-72: STRONG EFFECTIVENESS\nCavalry raids dominate countryside. 15-25 casualties in scattered skirmishes. Crop burning destroys 60-70% of vega harvest—catastrophic for Granada's food supply. Supply convoys from southern ports almost completely interdicted. Montefrío falls early July. Iznalloz breaches mid-July, surrenders late July. By end July: Granada's harvest ruined, encirclement nearly complete, population facing starvation by winter, Sultan's position deteriorating rapidly.\n\n73-84: EXCELLENT EXECUTION\nRaiding campaign crushes opposition. 10-15 cavalry casualties. Granada's guerrillas forced into defensive posture protecting city itself. Crop burning destroys 70-80% of harvest—devastating loss. Southern supply routes effectively closed by constant interception. Montefrío surrenders early July. Iznalloz falls mid-July after quick bombardment. By end July: Granada almost completely isolated, minimal food reserves, civilians already on reduced rations, encirclement complete, Sultan facing crisis by September.\n\n85-93: DEVASTATING CAMPAIGN\nCastilian cavalry dominates completely. 5-10 casualties from minor skirmishes. Enemy guerrillas suffer heavy losses (100+ casualties) trying to defend crops and convoys, then withdraw to Granada's walls. Systematic burning destroys 80-90% of harvest. All supply convoys intercepted or destroyed. Montefrío and Iznalloz both surrender quickly (early-mid July) after seeing futility. By end July: Granada's food situation critical, no external supplies reaching city, population already hungry, Sultan facing starvation crisis by late autumn, complete strategic success.\n\n94-97: CATASTROPHIC COLLAPSE FOR GRANADA\nTotal cavalry superiority. Negligible casualties (3-5). Enemy guerrillas destroyed as effective force (150+ casualties, survivors flee to city). Entire vega burned systematically—95% crop destruction. Southern ports effectively blockaded by aggressive interdiction. Both fortresses surrender within days of seeing overwhelming force. Several small watchtowers and positions also surrender. By end July: Granada completely isolated, almost no food reserves, immediate rationing, civilians starving by October, Sultan's position untenable, potential internal unrest.\n\n98-100: STRATEGIC ANNIHILATION\nPerfect execution. Zero significant casualties. Enemy guerrilla force shattered in major engagement (200+ casualties, remnants withdraw permanently to Granada). Complete destruction of vega crops. Southern supply routes absolutely closed. Montefrío, Iznalloz, and multiple smaller positions surrender without serious resistance by mid-July. Granada city completely alone, no food production, no external supplies, immediate severe rationing. By August: Granada facing starvation crisis, civilian unrest beginning, Sultan's authority collapsing, potential coup or revolution, war effectively won.\n\nTimeline: June-July 1432 (approximately 8 weeks of operations)\n\nKey Variables:\n\nCavalry effectiveness vs. enemy raiders\n\nSpeed and thoroughness of crop destruction\n\nSuccess at interdicting southern supply convoys\n\nProgress at two siege fronts (Montefrío, Iznalloz)\n\nGranada's ability to adapt and defend critical resources\n\nReady when you are to roll the physical d100.",

      "text": "Rolled 35, which falls in the \"28-42: MIXED OUTCOMES\" category. Let me look at what that entails:\n\n\"Raiding produces uneven results. 30-45 cavalry casualties. Crop burning destroys 40-50% of vega harvest—painful for Granada but survivable. Some supply convoys intercepted, others reach city. Montefrío walls breached, garrison negotiating. Iznalloz under heavy bombardment, walls cracking. By end July: Granada facing food difficulties by winter but not immediate crisis, one fortress fallen or falling, pressure mounting but not decisive.\"\n\nSo this is a mixed result - not a failure, but not the decisive success Juan hoped for. The strategy is working but slowly and imperfectly. I need to show:\n\n1. The withdrawal of Infante Juan and redeployment\n2. The cavalry raiding campaign with uneven results\n3. Crop burning achieving 40-50% destruction (significant but not crippling)\n4. Some supply convoys getting through, others intercepted\n5. Montefrío making progress toward surrender\n6. Iznalloz under bombardment but not yet fallen\n7. 30-45 cavalry casualties\n8. Granada hurt but not desperate yet\n9. Timeline now early August\n\nThis should feel like Juan's strategy is working but the Sultan is fighting back effectively. Not a disaster, but frustrating - the kind of grinding attritional warfare where victory is slow and costly. The encirclement is tightening but Granada still has some breathing room.\n\nI should stop at a natural decision point for Juan.\n\nTHE CONSOLIDATION - LATE MAY TO EARLY JUNE\n\nThe orders went out immediately. Infante Juan received word on May 27th to withdraw from Motril back to Málaga, reorganize, and send 2,000 men north to reinforce Don García at Montefrío. The remaining 1,200 would march east to join the main army. The coastal offensive was abandoned—at least for now.\n\nBy June 3rd, the forces had redeployed:\n\nMontefrío: Don García's force swelled to 7,000 troops with the reinforcements. Overwhelming numbers, fresh supplies, renewed siege operations.\n\nIznalloz: Juan's main army—28,700 troops with four operational bombards—began systematic bombardment of the northern fortress.\n\nCavalry Raiding Companies: 4,200 light and medium cavalry organized into fourteen independent companies of 250-350 riders each. Orders: burn the vega, intercept supply convoys, make the countryside a wasteland. Operate independently, live off the land, avoid major engagements.\n\nThe strategy shifted from rapid conquest to methodical strangulation.\n\nTHE RAIDING CAMPAIGN - JUNE 1432\n\nThe cavalry companies fanned out across Granada's agricultural heartland like a plague of locusts. The vega—that rich plain surrounding Granada city, normally golden with wheat and barley—became a battlefield of a different kind.\n\nWeek One (June 4-10):\n\nInitial raids met light resistance. Three companies burned perhaps 800 acres of crops south and west of Granada. Smoke columns rose into the summer sky, visible from the city walls. Castilian horsemen rode through fields setting torches to dry grain, methodically destroying what would have been Granada's harvest.\n\nBut the Sultan's guerrillas adapted quickly. On June 8th, a raiding company of 280 Castilian cavalry was caught in the open by 400 Moorish riders. The engagement was brief and brutal—the Castilians fought their way out but left 23 dead and 15 wounded behind. The survivors withdrew, and that sector of the vega remained unharvested but unburned.\n\nWeek Two (June 11-17):\n\nThe pattern established itself: cat and mouse across the fertile plain. Castilian raiders would approach a field, and Moorish cavalry would appear on the ridges. Sometimes the Castilians burned and withdrew before engagement. Sometimes they were intercepted and had to fight. Sometimes they found the fields already harvested under guard, the grain carried behind Granada's walls.\n\nDon Fadrique, coordinating the raiding operations, reported on June 17th: \"We're burning what we can reach, but the Sultan's cavalry is contesting every field. They've pulled back from harassing our supply lines and are defending the harvest instead. Smart move—they need the food more than they need to hurt us.\"\n\nBy mid-June, the accounting showed:\n\nApproximately 2,500 acres burned (roughly 40% of the vega's main grain fields)\n\n34 Castilian cavalry dead in skirmishes\n\n41 wounded\n\nEstimated enemy cavalry casualties: 50-60 dead, 40+ wounded\n\nGranada successfully harvesting remaining 60% under heavy guard\n\nWeek Three-Four (June 18-30):\n\nThe work continued—grinding, frustrating, methodical. More fields burned. More skirmishes. The countryside became a scarred landscape of blackened earth and standing grain depending on which cavalry force controlled which sector.\n\nSupply convoy interdiction showed similar mixed results. Two major convoys from the southern ports were intercepted and destroyed—perhaps 80 wagons of food and supplies burned, 40 teamsters and guards killed. But three other convoys reached Granada through mountain passes, delivering Moroccan grain, dried fish, and weapons.\n\nBy June 30th, the strategic picture was:\n\n40-50% of vega harvest destroyed—painful for Granada but not crippling\n\nSouthern supply routes disrupted but not closed—some supplies getting through\n\nEnemy guerrilla force still combat effective—perhaps 1,400 cavalry remaining, defending rather than raiding\n\nCastilian cavalry casualties: 38 dead, 47 wounded from six weeks of operations\n\nTHE SIEGE FRONTS - JUNE-EARLY JULY\n\nMontefrío:\n\nThe reinforced siege proceeded with overwhelming force. Seven thousand troops invested the isolated fortress. Bombardment began June 6th with captured siege equipment from the coastal force. By June 20th, visible cracks showed in the western wall. By June 28th, a breach opened.\n\nOn July 2nd, garrison officers requested parley. The same pattern as Alhama—\"we have resisted, the walls are broken, we wish to negotiate terms.\" Juan offered the standard terms: safe conduct or stay with protections. The garrison accepted.\n\nMontefrío fell on July 5th. One hundred fifty garrison troops departed for Granada. Ninety chose to remain. A 200-man Castilian garrison moved in. Another fortress secured.\n\nIznalloz:\n\nThe northern fortress proved tougher. Strong walls, determined garrison of perhaps 800 troops, excellent position on high ground. The four bombards began systematic work on June 4th.\n\nProgress was steady but not spectacular. By June 20th, visible damage but no breach. By July 1st, a section of wall showed serious stress fractures. By July 8th—as reports were compiled—the bombardment continued, the wall cracking further, but no breach yet.\n\nPietro Calabrese's assessment on July 8th: \"Another week, maybe ten days. The wall is good construction, and we're down to four guns. We're getting there, but it's slow work.\"\n\nTHE SITUATION ASSESSMENT - JULY 8TH, 1432\n\nJuan stood in his command tent outside Iznalloz with his senior commanders. Two months had passed since the disastrous first offensive. Álvaro spread the updated campaign map and accounting ledgers across the table.\n\nMilitary Status:\n\nMain army at Iznalloz: 28,500 troops (after casualties)\n\nMontefrío secured with garrison\n\nAlhama, Moclín, Íllora, Loja, Alcalá, Málaga—all secured\n\nFour operational bombards\n\nCavalry companies still raiding but facing determined resistance\n\nCasualties (May-July):\n\nInitial offensive disaster: 226 dead, 207 wounded\n\nCavalry raiding campaign: 38 dead, 47 wounded\n\nSiege operations: 25 dead, 34 wounded\n\nTotal: 289 dead, 288 wounded (577 total casualties in ten weeks)\n\nEnemy Situation (estimated):\n\nGranada city: 8,000-10,000 garrison\n\nEnemy cavalry: ~1,400 remaining (down from 1,500-2,000)\n\nIznalloz: ~750 defenders, walls cracking\n\nSouthern ports: Still in enemy hands (Motril, Salobreña)\n\nFood situation: 40-50% of harvest destroyed, but 50-60% saved\n\nSupply routes: Disrupted but functional\n\nMartín provided the intelligence assessment: \"Granada is hurt but not broken. They saved enough harvest to feed the city through autumn, probably into winter with rationing. The southern ports are still bringing in supplies—not enough to thrive, but enough to survive. The Sultan's cavalry is bloodied but still defending effectively.\"\n\nThe Master of Calatrava added: \"Iznalloz will fall within two weeks. Then we can march right up to Granada's walls if we choose. But the city itself...\" He shook his head. \"Those walls are massive. The garrison is large. And they've got enough food to hold for months.\"\n\nÁlvaro laid out the strategic options:\n\n\"Your Majesty, we face a choice. The strangulation strategy is working—but slowly. Granada is weakening, not collapsing. We have three options:\n\nOption One: Continue the Current Strategy\nKeep raiding, keep burning what we can reach, maintain the pressure. Eventually—probably by spring 1433—starvation forces them to negotiate. Slow but low-casualty.\n\nOption Two: Take the Southern Ports\nOrganize another offensive against Motril and Salobreña. Cut off the supply lifeline completely. Makes the strangulation faster and more effective. Requires detaching forces again.\n\nOption Three: Direct Siege of Granada\nOnce Iznalloz falls, march on Granada city itself. Massive undertaking—could take months, thousands of casualties—but it's the direct approach. Ends the war definitively if we succeed.\n\nOption Four: Negotiate\nOffer terms now while we hold the military advantage. The Sultan might accept vassalage or territorial concessions to avoid complete destruction. Ends the war quickly, but leaves Granada as a political entity.\"\n\nThe tent was quiet. Outside, the afternoon bombardment fired—the steady boom of guns that had become background noise.\n\nDon Fadrique spoke carefully: \"We've taken nearly 600 casualties in ten weeks, Your Majesty. The men are tired. Not broken, but this is grinding work. Whatever we choose next, they'll do it—but they need to see an end in sight.\"\n\nFray Hernando added the moral dimension: \"The crop burning is taking its toll on the troops' spirits as well. They understand military necessity, but burning food that children will need... it weighs on them. If we continue this path, we should be clear about how long we expect it to last.\"\n\nWhat do you want to do?",

      "text": "Juan is proposing a very bold and risky strategy:\n1. He personally will lead 5,000 men (with strong cavalry element) into southern Granada to take watchtowers and subdue villages - this is the Alpujarras region that Martín described as \"rugged, Muslim-populated valleys... very hostile territory for Christian forces\"\n2. After Montefrío falls (it already fell on July 5th actually), Master of Calatrava takes 5,000 troops to siege the coastal ports WITH THE BOMBARDS\n3. Remaining 20,000+ troops secure held territory, maintain supply lines, and aggressively raid/scout Granada city to pin them down\n\nThe council's reaction would likely be:\n- Concern about the King personally leading a dangerous expedition into hostile territory\n- Strategic merit of completing the encirclement\n- Concern about splitting forces again (what just failed catastrophically)\n- BUT this time: Iznalloz nearly fallen, Montefrío already fallen, so only Granada city has large garrison\n- The southern operation is very risky - hostile population, difficult terrain, guerrilla-prone\n- Tactical merit: completing the strangulation, taking southern ports cuts supply line\n- Risk assessment: King's safety, force dispersal, timing\n\nActually, let me check: Montefrío fell July 5th, and we're at July 8th now. So that's already done.\n\nThe council would have mixed reactions:\n- Álvaro: Concerned about king's safety, but sees strategic merit\n- Master of Calatrava: Professional assessment, probably concerned about the south\n- Martín: Would STRONGLY warn about the Alpujarras\n- Infante Juan: Might offer to go instead of Juan\n- Fray Hernando: Concerned about king's safety\n- Don Fadrique: Tactical assessment\n\nThis is risky but potentially effective if executed well. The council would debate it seriously.\n\nCOUNCIL REACTION - JULY 8TH, EVENING\n\nThe commanders exchanged glances as Juan laid out his strategy. The silence stretched for several seconds before Álvaro spoke, choosing his words carefully:\n\n\"Your Majesty... the strategic logic is sound. Complete the encirclement, cut off the southern ports, pin Granada city down while we systematically take every remaining position. But...\"\n\nHe paused, clearly weighing how to phrase his concern. \"Your Majesty proposes to personally lead 5,000 men into the Alpujarras—the most hostile territory in Granada. This is where the concern lies.\"\n\nMartín stepped forward, his face grave. \"Your Majesty, I must speak plainly. The southern valleys—the Alpujarras—are not like the fortresses you've conquered. There are no walls to breach, no garrisons to negotiate with. It is rugged mountain country, dozens of small villages, populations that are fiercely loyal to Granada and Islam. The terrain...\" He shook his head. \"Ambush country. Every pass, every valley, every village could hide hostile forces. The watchtowers you want to take are not isolated—they're supported by the local population.\"\n\nThe Master of Calatrava added his professional assessment: \"Five thousand troops with strong cavalry is a substantial force, but cavalry is less effective in mountain terrain. You'd be operating in the region the Sultan's guerrillas know best, where the civilians will report your every movement, where supply lines are vulnerable, and where the enemy can use the terrain against you.\"\n\nInfante Juan spoke up: \"Your Majesty, if someone must lead this operation... let me go. You are the king. Your presence is needed with the main army. I have experience with difficult operations—the coastal campaign taught me much about operating in hostile territory. I could lead the southern expedition while you coordinate the overall strategy.\"\n\nDon Fadrique was more pragmatic: \"The operation itself has merit. Someone needs to subdue those watchtowers and villages, or they'll keep feeding intelligence and supplies to Granada city. But the King personally commanding a punitive expedition through hostile mountains...\" He trailed off meaningfully.\n\nFray Hernando spoke with pastoral concern: \"Your Majesty, you are not merely a commander. You are the kingdom's anointed monarch, husband to the Queen, soon to be father to an heir. If something happened to you in those mountains—an ambush, disease, injury—the consequences extend far beyond military strategy. The kingdom's stability depends on your life.\"\n\nÁlvaro leaned forward: \"Let me propose adjustments to Your Majesty's strategy that preserve its merit while addressing the risks:\n\nThe Southern Operation: Five thousand troops with strong cavalry—excellent force composition. But commanded by a senior noble, not the King. Infante Juan has volunteered. Alternatively, Don Fadrique or another experienced commander. The mission: subdue watchtowers, pacify hostile villages, eliminate southern guerrilla bases. Timeline: 4-6 weeks.\n\nThe Coastal Operation: Master of Calatrava with 5,000 troops and the bombards to take Motril and Salobreña. This I fully support. Montefrío has fallen, so he can move immediately. Two to three weeks per fortress, both secured by August.\n\nThe Main Force: Twenty thousand troops securing territory, maintaining supply lines, and aggressively raiding around Granada city. This pins their garrison inside, prevents sorties, maintains psychological pressure. Your Majesty commands this force personally—coordinating all three operations from a secure position.\n\nThe Coordination: You remain as supreme commander but not exposed to the highest-risk operation. You can reinforce any front that faces difficulties, respond to Sultan's moves, and maintain strategic flexibility.\"\n\nThe Master of Calatrava nodded approval. \"This preserves the strategic concept—complete encirclement, cut southern supplies, maintain pressure—while keeping the King where he can command effectively without unnecessary personal risk.\"\n\nMartín added: \"Your Majesty, I say this with respect: the southern expedition needs a commander who knows mountain warfare and guerrilla tactics. It needs someone expendable—forgive my bluntness—in case things go wrong. It does not need the King of Castile. What it does need is the King's authority backing the operation, the King's strategic coordination, and the King's ability to send reinforcements if required.\"\n\nInfante Juan spoke again: \"Brother, let me take this mission. I failed at Motril—let me redeem that with success in the south. I understand now what guerrilla warfare demands. I will take those watchtowers, pacify those villages, and eliminate the southern threat. You coordinate the grand strategy as only the King can.\"\n\nDon Fadrique added a tactical point: \"If Your Majesty insists on leading the southern operation personally, then we must adjust the entire plan. We'd need to increase the force to 8,000-10,000 to ensure overwhelming security. We'd need slower, more methodical advance. We'd need contingency plans for royal evacuation if things go wrong. It changes the whole character of the operation from a swift punitive raid to a royal expedition.\"\n\nThe tent waited. The commanders had made their case: the strategy was sound, but the King should coordinate rather than personally lead the most dangerous element.\n\nÁlvaro concluded: \"Your Majesty, the choice is yours. But consider: you have proven your personal courage many times—at Íllora's negotiations, at Alhama's parley, throughout this campaign. No one questions your bravery. What the kingdom needs now is your strategic vision and coordination, not your presence in ambush-prone mountain valleys.\"\n\nOutside, the bombardment of Iznalloz continued—boom, boom, boom—the methodical work of winning a war through patience and overwhelming force.\n\nWhat is your decision?",

Main army waits for Iznalloz to fall\n3. Master of Calatrava goes to coastal ports (Motril, Salobreña) once Iznalloz falls\n4. Juan will lead the main army directly to Granada city and demand surrender once Iznalloz falls\n\nThis is much more acceptable to the council. Let me think through their responses:\n\n**Positive reactions:**\n- King not personally going into most dangerous terrain\n- Infante Juan gets redemption opportunity with explicit caution orders\n- Main army stays concentrated under Juan's command\n- Direct march on Granada shows decisive action\n- Master of Calatrava gets clear coastal mission\n\n**Concerns they might raise:**\n- Timeline coordination between three operations\n- What \"demand surrender\" means - is Juan preparing for siege of Granada city itself?\n- Granada's walls are massive - is demanding surrender realistic without completing the encirclement first?\n- Force distributions\n\nLet me draft realistic council responses that address both the positives and any remaining tactical questions.\n\nCOUNCIL REACTION - REVISED STRATEGY\n\nThe atmosphere in the tent shifted immediately. Álvaro's shoulders relaxed visibly, and several commanders nodded approval.\n\n\"Much better, Your Majesty,\" Álvaro said with evident relief. \"This addresses our concerns while maintaining strategic initiative.\"\n\nInfante Juan stepped forward and bowed. \"Thank you for the command, Your Majesty. I will be cautious. Methodical. The southern watchtowers and villages will be subdued, but I will not risk my men unnecessarily in ambush terrain. Slow and certain.\" He paused. \"And brother... thank you for the trust after Motril.\"\n\nThe Master of Calatrava spoke approvingly: \"The coastal operation with the bombards—I can have Motril and Salobreña within four to six weeks once Iznalloz falls and I can move. Those ports will be closed, and Granada's southern lifeline cut.\"\n\nMartín studied the map, then looked at Juan thoughtfully. \"Your Majesty, one question about the march on Granada city and the demand for surrender. Are you preparing to lay siege to the city itself, or is this a demonstration of force intended to intimidate them into negotiating?\"\n\nDon Fadrique expanded on this: \"Granada's walls are... extraordinary, Your Majesty. Three times the thickness of anything we've faced. The Alhambra fortress crowns the city. Eight to ten thousand garrison troops. If we march up to those walls and they refuse surrender, we commit to a siege that could last months and cost thousands of lives.\"\n\nÁlvaro added carefully: \"The demand for surrender has psychological weight—showing we can reach their gates, that they're isolated, that resistance is futile. But we should be clear about what happens if they refuse. Do we then settle into siege positions and begin bombardment? Do we continue the strangulation strategy from their very walls? Do we raid their remaining territory while camped outside the gates?\"\n\nThe Master of Calatrava raised a practical concern: \"Timing is also significant. If we march on Granada immediately after Iznalloz falls—say, mid to late July—we arrive before the Master of Calatrava has taken the coastal ports, and before Infante Juan has subdued the southern region. Granada will still have those supply lines active. The Sultan might calculate he can hold out.\"\n\nHe traced the timeline on the map. \"Alternatively, if we wait until August—allowing the coastal and southern operations to complete first—we march on Granada when it is truly isolated. No ports, no southern support, no watchtowers reporting our movements. The demand for surrender carries much more weight because their position is objectively hopeless.\"\n\nInfante Juan added: \"My southern operation will take time if done carefully as Your Majesty wisely ordered. Perhaps four to five weeks to methodically clear the watchtowers and pacify the villages. Call it mid-August before I can report success.\"\n\nDon Fadrique synthesized: \"So the question becomes: Does Your Majesty march on Granada immediately when Iznalloz falls—demonstrating our reach but before complete encirclement—or do we coordinate so that all three operations complete first, and we march on Granada in August when isolation is total?\"\n\nMartín offered his strategic assessment: \"There is merit to both approaches. Marching immediately shows aggression and might catch them psychologically unprepared—the shock of seeing your full army at their gates. But waiting until August means every escape route is closed, every supply line cut, and the Sultan has no hope of relief. The siege—if it comes to that—would be shorter and less costly because they'd have no external support at all.\"\n\nÁlvaro looked at Juan: \"Your Majesty, the council approves the revised strategy. Infante Juan to the south with caution, Master of Calatrava to the coast, main army under your command. The question is timing: march on Granada immediately after Iznalloz falls in mid-July, or wait until complete encirclement in August?\"\n\nFray Hernando added a moral consideration: \"If we march in July and they refuse surrender, we begin a siege while they still have some supply lines. More suffering, longer timeline. If we march in August when truly isolated, the surrender demand carries the weight of genuine hopelessness—they know starvation is inevitable. The latter might bring swifter resolution with less bloodshed.\"\n\nThe tent waited for Juan's decision on timing.\n\nOutside, another bombard fired at Iznalloz's cracking walls. Perhaps ten days until that fortress fell and these operations could begin.\n\nWhat do you decide about the timing?",

Several nodded with understanding and approval.\n\n\"Ah,\" Álvaro said, \"now I understand Your Majesty's thinking completely. This is elegant.\"\n\nHe traced the strategy on the map: \"Iznalloz falls mid-July. You immediately march the main army—perhaps 23,000 troops after garrison assignments—directly to Granada city. You surround them, raid aggressively, make them watch their isolation from their own walls. From inside Granada, they cannot know what's happening elsewhere—they don't know if the coastal ports have fallen, if the southern watchtowers are being taken. They only see: a massive army at their gates and the countryside burning.\"\n\nThe Master of Calatrava nodded approvingly. \"And critically, Your Majesty doesn't commit to assaulting those walls without artillery. You position for strangulation—the siege without the assault. If they surrender when they see the army, excellent. If they refuse, you're already in position to systematically destroy everything around them while the other operations complete.\"\n\nMartín added his professional assessment: \"From Sultan Yusuf's perspective, this is his nightmare. He looks out from the Alhambra and sees twenty thousand troops camped outside. He sees smoke from burning fields. His scouts—if any can get out—report nothing but Castilian forces in every direction. He doesn't know the bombards are absent. He doesn't know some supply routes might theoretically still exist. He only knows: we are here, we are many, and we are not leaving.\"\n\nDon Fadrique spoke tactically: \"The raiding from positions around the city is excellent strategy. We're not sitting static in siege lines—we're mobile, aggressive, making it impossible for them to sortie effectively or bring in supplies. Every mill within ten miles, burned. Every field, destroyed. Every convoy attempting to reach them, intercepted. Meanwhile Your Majesty's army is safe in fortified camps, not exposed to wall-mounted artillery or desperate sorties.\"\n\nInfante Juan smiled slightly. \"And while the Sultan is focused on the army at his gates, I'm quietly dismantling his southern support network, and the Master is taking his ports. By the time he realizes how complete the isolation is—if he doesn't surrender immediately—it's far too late.\"\n\nÁlvaro laid out the timeline: \"Iznalloz falls approximately July 18th, based on current bombardment progress. Your Majesty marches immediately—three days to position around Granada, call it July 21st. You send the surrender demand July 22nd. Meanwhile:\n\nInfante Juan begins southern operations late July, completes mid-to-late August\n\nMaster of Calatrava begins coastal operations late July with the bombards, completes Motril and Salobreña by early September\n\nYour Majesty maintains pressure on Granada throughout\n\nIf they surrender in July when they see the army—war essentially over. If they refuse and we continue strangulation through August-September-October, they're watching their last supply lines cut in real-time while already surrounded and starving.\"\n\nThe Master of Calatrava added: \"And Your Majesty, once my coastal operations complete in September, I can bring the four bombards to join the main army if needed. So even if Granada holds out stubbornly into autumn, we'd have the option of direct bombardment then—after months of starvation have weakened them and our artillery is available.\"\n\nFray Hernando spoke approvingly: \"This strategy offers them genuine opportunity for honorable surrender while positioned to prevail regardless of their choice. The moral position is sound—you demonstrate overwhelming force, make clear their position is hopeless, offer reasonable terms, and if they refuse, the consequences are the result of their leader's obstinacy, not your cruelty.\"\n\nDon Fadrique raised one practical question: \"Your Majesty, when you position around Granada, what terms do you intend to offer? The same as previous fortresses—safe conduct for garrison, protections for civilians who stay? Or different terms given that this is the capital and the Sultan himself?\"\n\nÁlvaro added: \"And what is Your Majesty's assessment of Sultan Yusuf? We know from the guerrilla campaign that he's capable of aggressive strategy. But is he pragmatic enough to surrender when he sees your army, or is he the type to resist to the bitter end regardless of cost to his people?\"\n\nMartín spoke thoughtfully: \"I served under his father and alongside Sultan Yusuf when he was younger. He is... proud. Intelligent, capable of bold moves as the guerrilla campaign showed, but also rigid in his sense of honor and religious duty. Surrendering the capital of Granada to Christian forces...\" He shook his head slowly. \"He might do it if the alternative is watching his people starve and his dynasty destroyed. But he will not surrender easily or quickly. Your Majesty should expect him to test your resolve first.\"\n\nThe tent waited. The strategy was approved. Now the questions were tactical: what terms to offer, and what to expect from the Sultan when that massive Castilian army appears outside his gates.\n\nWhat terms do you intend to offer Sultan Yusuf when you reach Granada's walls?",

Peripheral operations (southern watchtowers, coastal ports) just beginning.\n\nSUCCESS/FAILURE FACTORS\n\nSUCCESS FACTORS:\n\nIznalloz garrison demoralized from weeks of bombardment\n\nPattern of honorable surrenders established (precedent set)\n\nOverwhelming force (23,000 troops) for march and positioning\n\nGranada garrison doesn't expect immediate arrival at their gates\n\nSultan's cavalry weakened from June-July losses\n\nPsychological shock of seeing full army outside capital\n\nMain roads to Granada secured by conquered territory\n\nHigh Castilian morale from recent victories\n\nFAILURE FACTORS:\n\nIznalloz garrison might resist stubbornly (families in Granada)\n\nFour bombards less effective than original five\n\nMarch to Granada exposes supply lines to remaining guerrillas\n\nJuly heat and potential disease in concentrated army\n\nGranada garrison fresh and defending home ground\n\nSultan might launch aggressive sortie against arriving army\n\nPositioning around massive city exposes troops to wall artillery\n\nCoordination complexity with three simultaneous operations starting\n\nTroops exhausted from three months continuous campaigning\n\nCAMPAIGN OUTCOME TABLE (d100)\n\n1-5: CATASTROPHIC DISASTER\nIznalloz garrison launches desperate sortie during bombardment, overruns gun position, destroys two bombards and kills 80+ troops including Pietro Calabrese. Siege collapses into chaos. Retreat necessary to regroup. March to Granada delayed weeks. Sultan emboldened, launches aggressive operations. Strategic timeline ruined. 150+ total casualties.\n\n6-12: SEVERE SETBACKS\nIznalloz resists stubbornly for 3+ additional weeks. One bombard damaged in sortie. March to Granada harassed heavily by guerrillas (60+ casualties). Arrival at Granada disorganized, Sultan sorties aggressively, initial positioning costs 40+ casualties. Operations delayed into August, momentum lost. 180+ total casualties.\n\n13-20: MAJOR COMPLICATIONS\nIznalloz requires full additional two weeks bombardment. Garrison resists until assault necessary (50+ casualties). March to Granada faces persistent harassment (30-40 casualties). Positioning around city contested by Granada sorties. Initial raiding ineffective. Timeline slips to early August. 120+ casualties, strategy proceeding but badly delayed.\n\n21-32: SIGNIFICANT DELAYS\nIznalloz walls breached but garrison negotiates for week before surrendering (mid to late July). March faces moderate guerrilla activity (20-25 casualties). Positioning around Granada takes 4-5 days with skirmishing. Initial raiding meets stiff resistance. Army fully positioned by late July but behind schedule. 60-80 casualties.\n\n33-48: MIXED RESULTS\nIznalloz breaches July 16-18, surrenders after brief negotiation. March proceeds with minor harassment (10-15 casualties). Positioning around Granada takes three days with scattered skirmishes. Initial raiding burns some fields but faces resistance. Army surrounds city by July 24-25. Operations beginning elsewhere on schedule. 35-50 casualties. Acceptable but unspectacular execution.\n\n49-65: SOLID EXECUTION\nIznalloz breaches July 15-16, garrison requests terms immediately. Falls by July 18. March to Granada proceeds smoothly with minimal harassment (5-10 casualties). Positioning completed efficiently in two days. Initial aggressive raiding destroys nearby fields. Army fully surrounding Granada by July 22-23. Sultan clearly surprised. Peripheral operations launching on schedule. 20-30 casualties.\n\n66-78: STRONG PERFORMANCE\nIznalloz breaches July 14, garrison recognizes futility and surrenders July 15-16. Rapid march to Granada (July 17-20) faces negligible resistance. Professional positioning around city completed in 36 hours. Immediate aggressive raiding destroys mills and fields visible from Granada's walls. Psychological impact evident—defenders watching in shock. Army positioned July 21, ready for demand. 10-15 casualties. Excellent coordination.\n\n79-87: EXCELLENT EXECUTION\nIznalloz garrison, seeing Montefrío's example, requests terms before final breach (July 13-14). Falls July 15 with minimal casualties. Forced march reaches Granada July 18-19, complete surprise to defenders. Positioning executed flawlessly with coordinated cavalry screens. Immediate systematic raiding burns everything within 5 miles of walls. Granada garrison stunned by speed and professionalism. Army positioned July 20. Peripheral operations beginning strongly. 5-10 casualties.\n\n88-94: EXCEPTIONAL CAMPAIGN\nIznalloz surrenders July 12-13 after officers realize resistance is futile. Zero assault casualties. Lightning march reaches Granada July 16-17, completely unexpected. Positioning around city executed like military textbook—coordinated, professional, intimidating. Massive raids immediately destroy visible resources. Granada's population watches in terror from walls. Sultan clearly shocked. Army fully positioned July 18-19. All operations coordinating perfectly. Negligible casualties (3-5).\n\n95-97: DEVASTATING SHOCK\nIznalloz garrison surrenders July 11-12 without serious resistance. Extremely rapid march reaches Granada July 15-16 before Sultan realizes Iznalloz has fallen. Positioning executed with overwhelming professionalism and speed. Systematic raiding begins immediately with no resistance—guerrilla cavalry withdrawn to city. Granada's garrison demoralized seeing this massive force. Population panicking visibly. Sultan's authority shaken. Army positioned July 17 in perfect order. Zero significant casualties.\n\n98-100: STRATEGIC MASTERPIECE\nIznalloz surrenders July 10-11 after seeing Castilian preparations. Forced march reaches Granada July 14-15 in record time. Sultan completely unprepared—thought he had weeks. Positioning executed with such speed and precision that Granada garrison cannot organize effective response. Immediate devastating raids. City in shock. Visible panic on walls. Some garrison members deserting. Sultan's position suddenly critical. Internal discord visible. Army positioned July 16 in overwhelming display of force. Potential immediate surrender negotiations. Historical achievement.\n\nTimeline Reference: Currently July 8th, Pietro estimates 7-10 days until Iznalloz breach. Table covers approximately July 8-25 period.\n\nKey Variables:\n\nSpeed of Iznalloz's fall\n\nCasualties during final siege phase\n\nMarch efficiency and guerrilla resistance\n\nPositioning execution around Granada\n\nInitial psychological impact on Sultan and garrison\n\nCoordination with peripheral operations starting\n\nReady when you are to roll the physical d100.",

      "text": "Rolled 30, which falls in the \"SIGNIFICANT DELAYS\" category (21-32):\n\n\"Iznalloz walls breached but garrison negotiates for week before surrendering (mid to late July). March faces moderate guerrilla activity (20-25 casualties). Positioning around Granada takes 4-5 days with skirmishing. Initial raiding meets stiff resistance. Army fully positioned by late July but behind schedule. 60-80 casualties.\"\n\nSo this is a result where things work but with complications and delays. The operation succeeds but is messier than hoped. I need to show:\n\n1. Iznalloz breach happening but then prolonged negotiations\n2. March facing guerrilla harassment with moderate casualties\n3. Positioning around Granada being contested\n4. Initial raiding facing resistance\n5. Timeline slipping to late July instead of mid-July\n6. Overall casualties in the 60-80 range\n\nThis creates tension and shows the Sultan is still fighting back effectively, but ultimately the strategic positioning is achieved. Just slower and bloodier than hoped.\n\nI should stop when Juan is positioned around Granada and ready to make his next decision about the surrender demand.\n\nTHE FALL OF IZNALLOZ - JULY 10-21, 1432\n\nThe breach opened on July 14th. Pietro's four bombards had worked methodically through the heat of early July, each shot carefully aimed at the weakening section of Iznalloz's northern wall. When the stone finally gave way that morning, a satisfying crack echoed through the valley, and a fifteen-foot section collapsed into rubble.\n\nJuan expected the familiar pattern: garrison officers appearing within hours to request terms, negotiations proceeding quickly, surrender within a day or two. Instead, silence greeted the breach.\n\nBy evening, white flags finally appeared on the walls. Officers came to parley—but their message was unexpected:\n\n\"We acknowledge the breach. We recognize we cannot hold. But we request time to... prepare. To organize our departure properly. To discuss terms among ourselves and with our families. We need one week.\"\n\nÁlvaro was immediately suspicious. \"They're stalling. Buying time for the Sultan to do something—reinforce Granada, organize a response, prepare defenses.\"\n\nBut the officers insisted: \"We are not delaying for military advantage. Look at the breach—we could not hold it even if we tried. We simply need time. Our families are deciding whether to leave for Granada or stay here. These are difficult choices. Please—one week, and we surrender peacefully.\"\n\nJuan granted it, though uneasily. The week crawled by. July 15th, 16th, 17th—each day watching Iznalloz's walls while knowing time was slipping away. Inside, the garrison was indeed organizing: families packing, heated discussions visible from the siege lines, the painful process of choosing between homeland and faith.\n\nFinally, on July 21st, the gates opened. The garrison marched out with dignity—about 600 troops, roughly 400 choosing to depart for Granada, 200 remaining under Castilian rule. The delay had cost precious days, but Iznalloz finally fell.\n\nTHE MARCH TO GRANADA - JULY 22-25\n\nJuan gave orders immediately: march on Granada. Twenty-three thousand troops formed up, leaving behind garrison forces at Iznalloz. The plan called for a swift three-day march to reach the capital by July 24th.\n\nThe Sultan, however, was not idle.\n\nThe guerrilla cavalry that had withdrawn to defensive positions around Granada struck the marching column repeatedly. Not massive engagements—the Castilian army was too large and well-organized for that—but constant harassment. Arrows from ridges. Quick strikes at foraging parties. Night raids on the edges of camp.\n\nOn July 23rd, a supply convoy from Íllora was hit hard—fifteen teamsters killed, twenty escort soldiers dead or wounded, crucial food supplies burned. The column had to slow down, tighten formation, send larger security details ahead.\n\nOn July 24th, a dawn raid on the army's baggage train killed twelve men and scattered thirty pack animals. Hours were lost rounding them up.\n\nThe march that should have taken three days stretched to four. Progress was steady but contested every mile. By the evening of July 25th—a week later than hoped—the van of the Castilian army finally came within sight of Granada.\n\nCasualties from the march: 47 dead, 38 wounded.\n\nGRANADA CITY - FIRST SIGHT\n\nJuan rode to the front of the column as the valley opened before them. There, in the afternoon light, sat Granada.\n\nThe city sprawled across the plain and hillsides—perhaps 50,000 souls behind those walls. The fortifications were... breathtaking in their scale. Massive stone walls, thirty feet high and fifteen feet thick in places, encircled the entire city. Towers at regular intervals. Multiple gates reinforced with iron and stone. And crowning the hill on the eastern side: the Alhambra, the red fortress-palace that was both symbol and stronghold of Moorish power in Iberia.\n\nMartín, riding beside Juan, spoke quietly: \"Now Your Majesty sees what I meant about those walls. Three times thicker than anything we've faced. The Alhambra fortress overlooks everything—artillery up there commands the entire city and approaches. Behind those walls: eight to ten thousand garrison troops, all the Sultan's remaining cavalry, and fifty thousand civilians with months of food stores despite our raiding.\"\n\nFrom Granada's walls, banners flew defiantly—green standards of the Nasrid dynasty snapping in the breeze. Juan could see tiny figures on the ramparts, thousands of them, watching this enormous Castilian army arrive.\n\nDon Fadrique rode up with a scout report: \"Your Majesty, the gates are closed and heavily defended. I count at least two thousand troops visible on the walls. They knew we were coming—probably days of warning from their cavalry. They're prepared.\"\n\nPOSITIONING THE ARMY - JULY 25-29\n\nThe process of positioning 23,000 troops around a major city proved more difficult than anticipated. Granada was huge—miles of perimeter—and the defenders contested every attempt to establish siege camps.\n\nJuly 25-26: Initial positioning on the northern and western sides. As Castilian troops moved to establish camps, Granada's gates would suddenly open and hundreds of cavalry would pour out in organized sorties. Not attempting to defeat the Castilian army—that was impossible—but disrupting the positioning, killing dozens of men, forcing defensive formations instead of construction work.\n\nFirst night: A raid killed eighteen men and burned supplies before being driven off.\n\nJuly 27: Attempting to position on the eastern side near the Vega. Heavy skirmishing as Granada's garrison actively contested the ground. The Alhambra's position on the heights meant its artillery—primitive but present—could range some of the approach routes. Twenty-three casualties in a single afternoon of fighting for position.\n\nJuly 28: Finally establishing coordinated camps on three sides (north, west, south). The eastern approach, closest to the Alhambra, remained contested and would require different tactics. More skirmishing, more casualties.\n\nJuly 29: Secure positions finally established. Strong fortified camps, cavalry screens, supply lines organized. The army was positioned—but it had taken five days of constant fighting instead of the hoped-for two.\n\nAdditional casualties from positioning: 67 dead, 51 wounded.\n\nINITIAL RAIDING ATTEMPTS - JULY 28-30\n\nJuan ordered immediate aggressive raiding to demonstrate Granada's isolation. Cavalry companies rode out to burn fields, destroy mills, intercept any supply attempts.\n\nBut Granada's remaining cavalry—perhaps 1,200-1,400 horsemen—sortied aggressively to contest every raid. The countryside around Granada became a constant running battle. Castilian raiders would approach a mill or field, and Moorish cavalry would appear to defend it. Sometimes the Castilians won and burned their target. Sometimes they were driven off. Sometimes both sides bloodied each other and withdrew.\n\nBy July 30th, perhaps a dozen mills burned, maybe 300 acres of crops destroyed in the immediate vicinity—but at the cost of constant skirmishing. The Sultan was not passively accepting the siege. He was fighting for every resource, every field, every day of supplies.\n\nCOMMAND TENT - JULY 30TH, EVENING\n\nJuan stood in his command tent in the fortified camp northwest of Granada. The city's walls were visible in the distance, torches beginning to flicker as evening fell. Álvaro spread reports across the table, his face showing the strain of the past three weeks.\n\nThe Accounting:\n\n\"Your Majesty. We are positioned around Granada, but it cost us:\n\nIznalloz Operations (July 10-21):\n\nBreach achieved July 14\n\nSurrender negotiations: 7 days\n\nFinal surrender: July 21\n\nCasualties: 8 dead, 6 wounded\n\nMarch to Granada (July 22-25):\n\n4 days instead of planned 3\n\nConstant guerrilla harassment\n\nCasualties: 47 dead, 38 wounded\n\nPositioning Operations (July 25-29):\n\n5 days of contested positioning\n\nActive Granada sorties\n\nCasualties: 67 dead, 51 wounded\n\nInitial Raiding (July 28-30):\n\nLimited success, heavy resistance\n\nCasualties: 12 dead, 9 wounded\n\nTotal for July Operations: 134 dead, 104 wounded (238 casualties)\nCampaign Total Since May: 423 dead, 392 wounded (815 total casualties)\n\nThe army positioned but timeline significantly delayed. Originally planned to arrive July 21-22, actually secured positions July 29. Eight days lost.\"\n\nThe Master of Calatrava added his assessment: \"The Sultan is fighting hard. Not trying to defeat us—he can't—but making every step costly. His garrison is aggressive, well-led, and defending their homes. This will not be easy.\"\n\nMartín spoke soberly: \"Your Majesty, from inside those walls, Sultan Yusuf sees: a massive Christian army, yes. But also an army that took a week to take position, that suffered over two hundred casualties just getting here, and that is already bleeding in skirmishes. He sees defenders successfully contesting our raiding. He will calculate that he can hold longer than we hoped.\"\n\nDon Fadrique reported on peripheral operations: \"Messages from Infante Juan—he's begun operations in the south, moving cautiously as ordered. Master of Calatrava preparing to depart for the coast with the bombards in two days. Both operations proceeding but obviously will take weeks.\"\n\nÁlvaro looked at Juan. \"Your Majesty, we are positioned. The question now: do we send the surrender demand immediately, or do we wait a few more days to conduct heavier raiding first—to make our strength more evident before making the offer?\"\n\nFray Hernando added: \"The timing of the offer matters. Send it too quickly, and the Sultan might think we're desperate to avoid a long siege. Wait too long, and more men die in skirmishing before negotiations even begin.\"\n\nOutside, the sounds of the vast camp settling for night—thousands of men, horses, the creak of wagons, distant voices. And beyond, lit by torches and the rising moon: Granada, defiant and massive behind its ancient walls.\n\nWhat do you do? Send the surrender demand now, or wait a few more days for heavier raiding first?",

The garrison marched out—approximately 600 troops, with 400 departing for Granada under escort and 200 choosing to remain under Castilian protection.

The army stretched before him—veterans of Íllora and Loja, new recruits from Jaén, nobles and commoners, Castilians and foreign crusaders, all wearing the dust and weariness of three months' campaigning.\n\nHe raised his voice to carry across the assembled troops:\n\n\"Men! Soldiers of Christ! Victory is near!\n\nWe have won every battle. We are superior and our enemies know this. They can only strike from darkness and hide before us like cowards do. They can only delay the inevitable.\n\nBut they soon can do so no longer. Grenada city is now the only remaining stronghold that is held in the name of Islam. Today, we march on them to see if they are ready to see reason and surrender.\n\nWe have been away from home. We are tired. We have fought and have suffered. But our goal comes ever closer. Taking Grenada will not be easy and may take some time yet. But the Moors must know that it is only a matter of time. They are surrounded.\n\nSo hold faith soldiers of Christ. The worst is already behind us. We march on Grenada.\"\n\nThe speech ended. The army stood in formation, processing the words.\n\nD100 TABLE: ARMY MORALE RESPONSE TO SPEECH\n\nSUCCESS FACTORS:\n\nString of victories (Íllora, Alhama, Moclín, Montefrío, Iznalloz)\n\nDemonstrated military superiority\n\nJuan's established reputation for honor\n\nReligious conviction of crusade\n\nClear proximity to final objective\n\nSpeech acknowledges their sacrifices honestly\n\nPromise that \"worst is behind us\"\n\nFAILURE FACTORS:\n\nThree months of grinding campaign\n\n815+ total casualties since May\n\nRecent disasters (May offensive, July delays)\n\nExhaustion and summer heat\n\nFacing massive Granada fortifications\n\nSpeech admits taking Granada \"may take some time\"\n\nMen want to go home to families\n\nUncertainty about actual timeline\n\n\"We are tired\" acknowledgment might reinforce fatigue\n\nNo promise of quick resolution\n\nMORALE RESPONSE TABLE (d100)\n\n1-6: SEVERE MORALE CRISIS\nSpeech falls completely flat. Men hear only \"may take some time\" and \"tired.\" Grumbling spreads through ranks immediately. Some veterans openly question whether Granada can be taken at all. Desertion that night: 40+ men. Officers report units questioning the campaign. Dangerous morale situation requiring immediate intervention.\n\n7-15: POOR RECEPTION\nTepid response, scattered applause only. Most men look weary and unconvinced. They hear acknowledgment of hardship but little inspiration. Morale remains low. Officers report men talking about \"another year of this\" pessimistically. Some desertions expected (10-15). Army will march but without enthusiasm or confidence.\n\n16-27: DISAPPOINTING RESPONSE\nPolite but unenthusiastic reception. Men appreciate honesty about challenges but aren't inspired. Applause is scattered and brief. Veterans shrug—they've heard speeches before. New recruits look uncertain. Morale neither improves nor worsens significantly. Army will do its duty but without fire or conviction.\n\n28-42: MIXED RECEPTION\nHalf the army responds well, half remains weary. Veterans appreciate the honesty and realistic assessment. New troops less certain. Moderate applause, some cheering from crusader contingents. Morale modest improvement in some units, unchanged in others. Sufficient for the march but not inspiring greatness.\n\n43-58: ADEQUATE RESPONSE\nSolid reception. Men appreciate the acknowledgment of their sacrifices and the honesty about challenges. Decent applause, some cheering. \"The worst is behind us\" resonates with veterans who remember May's disasters. Morale improves modestly. Army ready to march with reasonable confidence and determination.\n\n59-72: GOOD RECEPTION\nStrong response from most of the army. \"Victory is near\" and \"only a matter of time\" messages land well. Veterans cheer at \"we have won every battle.\" Good applause, sustained cheering from multiple units. Officers report improved spirits. Men seem more confident about the Granada operation. Morale notably improved.\n\n73-84: STRONG ENTHUSIASM\nExcellent reception. The message resonates—they ARE winning, Granada IS isolated, victory IS achievable. Loud cheering, sustained applause. \"Soldiers of Christ\" triggers religious fervor in many. Veterans energized by acknowledgment of superiority. New troops inspired by confidence. Morale significantly boosted. Army eager to march.\n\n85-92: POWERFUL IMPACT\nSpeech electrifies the army. Men roar approval at \"we have won every battle.\" The honesty about hardship followed by confidence in victory creates powerful connection. Prolonged cheering, religious enthusiasm visible. Officers report dramatic morale shift. Men talking eagerly about finishing the campaign. Energy and determination evident throughout ranks.\n\n93-97: INSPIRING TRIUMPH\nSpeech creates surge of conviction and purpose. Army erupts in sustained cheering and religious fervor. Veterans pound shields, crusaders sing hymns, even weary troops stand straighter. The combination of honest acknowledgment and confident purpose resonates perfectly. Morale transforms from tired to determined. Men ready to march on Granada with genuine enthusiasm and faith.\n\n98-100: LEGENDARY MOMENT\nSpeech becomes instant legend. Perfect pitch—acknowledging sacrifice while inspiring confidence, religious conviction meeting military reality. Army explodes with fervent cheering lasting minutes. Men weeping with emotion and conviction. Religious enthusiasm borders on ecstatic. Officers report complete transformation—exhausted army becomes crusading force with renewed purpose. Historical moment of leadership creating unshakeable morale and conviction.\n\nReady when you are to roll the physical d100.",

The army is now energized and ready. I should end with the situation set up for Juan to give orders or take the next action.\n\nTHE SPEECH'S IMPACT - JULY 21, AFTERNOON\n\nFor a moment after Juan finished, silence held. Twenty-two thousand men stood in the summer heat, the words settling over them like a benediction.\n\nThen someone—a veteran from the Íllora campaign—shouted: \"GOD WILLS IT!\"\n\nThe ancient crusader cry rippled through the ranks like wildfire. \"DEUS VULT! DEUS VULT!\" Thousands of voices picked it up, the Latin thundering across the plain. Within seconds, the entire army was roaring the words, fists raised to the sky.\n\nThe sound was overwhelming—a wall of human conviction that seemed to shake the very ground. Veterans who had looked exhausted minutes before were pounding their shields in rhythm with the chant. Infantry raised their spears skyward. Cavalry horses pranced nervously at the sudden eruption of noise and energy.\n\nThe crusader contingents—Italians, French, Germans who had joined from across Christendom—began singing a hymn in their various languages, the melody weaving through the chanting. Some men were weeping openly, overcome with emotion and religious fervor. Others shouted prayers toward heaven.\n\n\"SANTIAGO! SANTIAGO!\" The Spanish battle cry joined the Latin. \"For Castile! For Christ! For the King!\"\n\nÁlvaro de Luna stood beside the platform, watching the transformation with visible awe. He leaned toward Infante Juan, shouting to be heard over the din: \"I have never seen anything like this. Look at them!\"\n\nThe Master of Calatrava, a veteran of decades of warfare, had tears streaming down his weathered face. He wasn't the only commander visibly moved.\n\nDon Fadrique shouted over the noise: \"They were tired an hour ago! Now look—they would march on Hell itself if you commanded it!\"\n\nThe cheering continued for several minutes, wave after wave of religious conviction and military fervor. The men who had been dragging through the July heat, who had suffered through three months of grinding campaign, who had watched comrades die in skirmishes and sieges—those same men were now transformed. Backs straightened. Eyes blazed with renewed purpose. Weariness burned away in the fire of collective conviction.\n\nFray Hernando stood with tears on his face, his lips moving in prayer. When the roar finally began to subside enough for him to be heard, he called out: \"The Lord is with us! His hand guides our King! His strength fills our arms!\"\n\nFresh cheering erupted at the priest's words.\n\nOfficers were already moving through the ranks, capitalizing on the moment. Captains clapped their men on the shoulders, sharing in the enthusiasm. Sergeants organized the energy into formation. The chaotic fervor began channeling into military discipline energized by faith and conviction.\n\nAfter nearly five minutes, the cheering finally began to settle into a sustained roar that gradually faded to expectant readiness. The army stood transformed—no longer an exhausted force grinding through a long campaign, but a crusading host convinced of its purpose and confident in its victory.\n\nÁlvaro climbed onto the platform beside Juan, his voice carrying to the front ranks: \"The King has spoken! Prepare to march! We go to Granada! We go to finish what we started! We go to victory!\"\n\nAnother roar of approval shook the air.\n\nThe camp exploded into activity. Men rushing to their units, checking equipment with renewed energy, organizing supply trains with enthusiasm rather than resignation. Songs broke out spontaneously in different sections. Officers shouted orders that were met with eager compliance rather than weary acceptance.\n\nThe Master of Calatrava approached with his 5,000 men for the coastal operation, formed up and ready to depart. They cheered as they marched past the platform—confident, energized, ready for their mission.\n\nInfante Juan assembled his southern force—5,000 troops with strong cavalry. They too were transformed by the speech, eager to tackle the difficult mountain operation ahead.\n\nThe main army—22,000 strong—began forming up for the march to Granada. Veterans and new recruits alike moved with purpose and conviction. The transformation was complete.\n\nDon Fadrique reported: \"Your Majesty, the army is ready. More than ready—they are eager. Whatever fatigue they felt before... it's burned away. This is an army that believes it will win.\"\n\nÁlvaro added quietly: \"Your Majesty, that speech... it will be remembered. Men will tell their grandchildren they heard King Juan speak before the march on Granada. You gave them something more valuable than gold—you gave them certainty of purpose.\"\n\nThe sun was beginning its descent toward the western horizon. The army stood ready, transformed from a tired force into a crusading host burning with conviction.\n\nWhat do you do?",

Timeline: approximately 3-4 weeks of operations.\n\nSUCCESS/FAILURE FACTORS\n\nSUCCESS FACTORS:\n\nArmy morale exceptionally high (speech impact)\n\nOverwhelming numerical superiority (22,000 vs. ~10,000 garrison)\n\nStrong cavalry force (5,500+ horsemen)\n\nProfessional leadership and organization\n\nSecure supply lines from conquered territory\n\nGranada genuinely isolated from most external support\n\nClear strategic purpose understood by all troops\n\nExperience from months of campaign operations\n\nMultiple conquered fortresses as fallback positions\n\nFAILURE FACTORS:\n\nEstablishing fortified camp near massive hostile city extremely dangerous\n\nGranada garrison large, aggressive, defending home\n\nSultan's cavalry (~1,400) can contest raiding operations\n\nAlhambra fortress overlooks northern/eastern approaches\n\nJuly-August heat and disease risks with concentrated army\n\nGranada has months of food stores still\n\nCity population 50,000 provides huge labor/resource base\n\nSouthern ports (Motril, Salobreña) still nominally open\n\nSultan proven capable of aggressive defensive tactics\n\n3-4 weeks insufficient for true starvation effects\n\nRaiding operations expose cavalry to ambush and attrition\n\nCAMPAIGN OUTCOME TABLE (d100)\n\n1-4: CATASTROPHIC DISASTER\nMarch ambushed in mountain pass by massed Granada sortie (2,000+ troops). Surprise attack in confined terrain causes panic. 150+ killed, baggage train overrun, army forced to retreat to Iznalloz. Camp establishment fails completely. Sultan emboldened, launches aggressive operations. Morale collapses despite speech. Strategic catastrophe requiring complete reorganization.\n\n5-10: SEVERE SETBACKS\nMultiple disasters compound. Initial positioning contested by massive Granada sorties (100+ casualties). Camp partially constructed when major night raid destroys supplies and kills 60+ men. Disease outbreak in crowded conditions (80+ sick). Cavalry raiding met with devastating ambushes (40+ cavalry dead). Only weak blockade established. Granada resupplying successfully. 250+ total casualties. Strategy failing.\n\n11-18: MAJOR COMPLICATIONS\nCamp establishment heavily contested (70+ casualties in skirmishes). Granada sorties multiple times, disrupting construction. Cavalry raids meet strong resistance—several ambushed badly (30+ dead). Disease problems in summer heat (50+ sick). Weak blockade established but Granada getting supplies through mountain routes. Morale declining from initial high. 180+ casualties. Limited effectiveness.\n\n19-28: SIGNIFICANT DIFFICULTIES\nCamp established but at high cost (50+ casualties). Granada garrison aggressive, launching sorties every few days. Cavalry raiding produces mixed results—some convoys intercepted, others reach city. Several ambushes (20-25 cavalry casualties). Heat and minor disease affecting troops. Blockade porous—Granada still receiving supplies. 120+ casualties. Strategy proceeding but with major challenges.\n\n29-42: MIXED RESULTS\nCamp established after moderate fighting (30-40 casualties). Granada contests positioning but Castilian numbers prevail. Cavalry raiding intercepts some supply attempts but Granada's cavalry contests effectively. Several sharp engagements (15-20 casualties). Partial blockade—most major routes covered but mountain paths still used. Heat affecting operations. 80-100 casualties. Some strategic progress but incomplete control.\n\n43-58: MODERATE SUCCESS\nCamp solidly established after initial skirmishing (20-30 casualties). Strong fortifications completed within week. Cavalry raiding intercepts majority of supply convoys. Granada's cavalry contests but generally driven back. Several successful raids burn mills and fields within 3-5 miles. Blockade reasonably effective but not complete. 50-70 casualties. Granada's supply situation worsening but not critical yet.\n\n59-72: GOOD EXECUTION\nCamp established efficiently with minimal casualties (15-25). Strong fortifications, well-positioned. Cavalry raiding highly effective—most supply routes interdicted. Granada's cavalry forced largely defensive. Systematic burning of nearby resources. Blockade effective with multiple cavalry screens. Granada visibly affected—reduced sorties, defensive posture. 30-45 casualties. Strategy working well.\n\n73-84: STRONG PERFORMANCE\nProfessional camp establishment (10-15 casualties). Excellent fortifications completed quickly. Cavalry raiding dominates—Granada's riders avoiding engagement. Multiple supply convoys intercepted and destroyed. Systematic devastation of surrounding area. Tight blockade with overlapping cavalry screens. Granada clearly under pressure—minimal sorties, defensive. 20-30 casualties. Highly effective blockade.\n\n85-92: EXCELLENT CAMPAIGN\nMasterful execution. Camp established with minimal resistance (5-10 casualties). Perfect positioning and fortification. Cavalry raiding crushes opposition—Granada's cavalry suffers heavy losses (50+ enemy casualties) and withdraws to walls. Complete interdiction of supply routes. Systematic burning of all resources within 5 miles. Granada fully isolated, garrison demoralized. 10-20 casualties. Outstanding results.\n\n93-96: DEVASTATING EFFECTIVENESS\nPerfect military operation. Camp established unopposed—Granada garrison intimidated by army's approach. Fortifications completed in record time. Cavalry raiding operations destroy Granada's cavalry as effective force (80+ enemy casualties, remnants flee to city). Complete blockade—nothing enters or leaves. Systematic devastation. Visible panic in city. Some garrison desertions. Negligible casualties (5-10). Strategic masterpiece.\n\n97-100: TOTAL DOMINATION\nHistorical achievement. Army's arrival so overwhelming that Granada garrison barely contests. Camp established like military parade. Cavalry operations annihilate enemy riders (100+ casualties, force broken). Absolute blockade—complete control of all approaches. Devastation of surrounding area. City clearly in crisis—visible panic, garrison unrest, population desperate. Sultan's authority shaken. Zero significant casualties. Granada's position immediately critical. Possible early surrender negotiations.\n\nTimeline: Operations from July 22nd through mid-to-late August (approximately 3-4 weeks)\n\nKey Variables:\n\nSuccess of march and initial positioning\n\nCamp security and fortification quality\n\nCavalry effectiveness vs. Granada's horsemen\n\nAbility to interdict supply routes systematically\n\nGranada garrison's aggressiveness and capability\n\nDisease and heat impacts\n\nMorale sustainability from speech's impact\n\nReady when you are to roll the physical d100.",

STOP when Juan can make a decision - don't generate his dialogue or actions\n\nThe key is that the strategy is working but with major difficulties. The morale from the speech is sustaining them but being tested. Granada is proving to be a much tougher opponent than previous fortresses.\n\nTHE MARCH TO GRANADA - JULY 22-24, 1432\n\nThe army departed Iznalloz on July 22nd in high spirits, the energy from Juan's speech still palpable in every rank. Twenty-two thousand troops marching south in good order, singing crusader hymns, their banners snapping in the summer breeze. The twenty-mile journey should have taken three days at a steady pace.\n\nThe Sultan had other plans.\n\nOn the afternoon of July 23rd, as the van of the army entered a narrow section of the road between rocky outcroppings, Granada's cavalry struck. Perhaps 400 horsemen appeared from concealed positions on both flanks, firing arrows into the column before charging with lances.\n\nThe attack was professionally executed—targeting the middle of the column where infantry were concentrated, causing immediate chaos. Men scattered, formations broke, officers shouted contradictory orders in the confusion. The Moorish cavalry withdrew before the Castilian heavy horse could respond in force, but the damage was done: 23 dead, 31 wounded, and two hours lost reorganizing the column.\n\nThat night, a raid hit the camp's perimeter. Two hundred cavalry swept through in darkness, killing sentries, setting fires, and vanishing before a coordinated response could form. Fourteen men dead, supplies burned, the entire army roused and on edge for the remainder of the night.\n\nJuly 24th brought more harassment—arrows from distant ridges, small cavalry bands appearing and disappearing, forcing the column into defensive formation that slowed progress to a crawl. By evening, when the valley finally opened and Granada came into view, the army had suffered 41 dead and 47 wounded just reaching their objective.\n\nThe speech's morale boost was already being tested.\n\nFIRST SIGHT OF GRANADA - JULY 24, EVENING\n\nAs the sun descended toward the western mountains, Juan rode to the head of the column and saw Granada spread before him.\n\nThe city was vast. Walls thirty feet high encircled perhaps three square miles of densely packed buildings, minarets, markets, and palaces. The fortifications were the most formidable Juan had ever seen—massive stone construction, towers every hundred yards, multiple reinforced gates gleaming with bronze. And crowning the eastern heights: the Alhambra, the red fortress-palace, its walls catching the evening light like blood.\n\nGreen banners flew from every tower. On the ramparts, thousands of figures—soldiers and civilians alike—watched the Castilian army arrive. Even from a distance, their defiance was palpable.\n\nMartín spoke quietly: \"Now Your Majesty sees the reality. This is not Íllora or Alhama. This is the capital of an emirate, defended by men fighting for their homes and families, behind walls built to withstand armies far larger than ours.\"\n\nFrom Granada's northern gate—the closest to the approaching army—a massive force suddenly emerged. At least 1,500 troops: cavalry, infantry, even some makeshift artillery pieces. They deployed in battle formation across the approaches, directly blocking the path to the city.\n\nDon Fadrique cursed. \"They're not going to let us position unopposed. They're coming out to fight for every foot of ground.\"\n\nESTABLISHING THE CAMP - JULY 25-28\n\nThe next four days were brutal, grinding work contested at every step.\n\nJuly 25th: The Castilian vanguard attempted to establish initial positions northwest of the city, within sight of the main gate as Juan had ordered. The Granada force charged immediately. The ensuing battle lasted three hours—heavy infantry clashing, cavalry wheeling and charging, arrows darkening the sky. The Castilians won through sheer numbers, driving the defenders back to the walls, but at cost: 34 dead, 51 wounded. Ground was secured for the camp, but the price was steep.\n\nJuly 26th: Construction of fortifications began. Engineers laid out earthworks, infantry dug trenches, supply wagons were positioned. At noon, the gates opened again and 800 cavalry poured out in a sudden raid. They struck the eastern edge of the half-built camp, killing workers, destroying partially completed walls, setting fires. The raid was driven off but left 18 dead and significant damage to a morning's work.\n\nJuly 27th: A day of constant skirmishing. Granada's garrison launched three separate sorties—not attempting to destroy the camp, but disrupting, delaying, killing. Each sortie had to be met with organized resistance, pulling men from construction to fighting. Progress was agonizingly slow. The heat was oppressive, and by evening, men were collapsing from exhaustion and heat sickness. 11 dead in combat, 23 wounded, and the first cases of summer fever appearing in the crowded, incomplete camp.\n\nJuly 28th: Finally, the basic fortifications were complete—earth ramparts, wooden palisades, defensive ditches. The camp was functional and defensible, but it had taken twice as long as expected and cost far more than anticipated. That night, another raid killed 9 men and reminded everyone that even within the camp, they were not truly safe.\n\nCamp Establishment Casualties: 72 dead, 89 wounded\n\nThe fortified camp existed, positioned northwest of Granada within clear sight of the main gate. But the army occupying it was bloodied, exhausted, and already questioning how long this would take.\n\nCAVALRY RAIDING OPERATIONS - LATE JULY TO MID-AUGUST\n\nWith the camp established, Juan ordered aggressive cavalry raiding to interdict Granada's supply routes and devastate the surrounding area. Fifty-five hundred cavalry—divided into companies of 300-400 riders—fanned out across the territory.\n\nThe reality proved far more difficult than planned.\n\nWeek One (July 29 - August 4):\n\nGranada's cavalry—approximately 1,400 horsemen who knew every path, every village, every hiding place—contested every raid aggressively. The Castilian cavalry had superior numbers but inferior local knowledge.\n\nOn July 31st, a company of 350 Castilian riders pursuing a supply convoy through the foothills south of Granada rode into a carefully prepared ambush. Six hundred Moorish cavalry hit them from three directions in a narrow valley. The Castilians fought their way out, but left 27 dead and 19 wounded behind. The supply convoy reached Granada safely.\n\nSimilar patterns repeated across the region. Castilian raiders would approach a mill or field, only to find Granada's cavalry waiting. Sometimes the Castilians won through numbers and drove them off. Sometimes both sides bloodied each other and withdrew. Sometimes the defenders successfully protected their target.\n\nBy August 4th: Perhaps 6-8 mills destroyed, maybe 400 acres burned, three small supply convoys intercepted—but at a cost of 31 cavalry dead and 28 wounded.\n\nWeek Two (August 5-11):\n\nThe operations continued, both sides learning each other's patterns. The Castilian cavalry became more cautious, operating in larger groups, avoiding obvious ambush terrain. Granada's riders became more selective, defending only the most critical resources.\n\nBut the fundamental problem remained: Granada was huge, with multiple approach routes through mountain terrain. The Castilian cavalry, despite their numbers, couldn't cover everything. Supplies were getting through—not freely, but steadily enough. Small caravans using mountain paths at night, individual pack trains moving through terrain unsuitable for large cavalry formations, supplies cached in villages and moved in stages.\n\nDon Fadrique reported on August 10th: \"We're hurting them, Your Majesty, but we're not strangling them. For every convoy we intercept, another gets through. For every field we burn, they harvest two others under guard. And it's costing us—our cavalry is bleeding in small skirmishes every single day.\"\n\nWeek Two Casualties: 18 cavalry dead, 21 wounded\n\nWeek Three (August 12-18):\n\nThe heat intensified. August in Granada was brutal—temperatures climbing, the sun merciless, and the army camped on open ground with inadequate shade. Disease began spreading: summer fever, flux from contaminated water, heat exhaustion turning serious.\n\nThe raiding continued, but with diminishing energy. Men and horses were exhausted. The cavalry companies that rode out each morning were less enthusiastic, more cautious. They still intercepted some supplies, still burned some resources, but the aggressive interdiction Juan had envisioned was degrading into attritional skirmishing.\n\nOn August 15th, a particularly bold Granada sortie—perhaps 600 troops including cavalry and infantry—struck deep into Castilian raiding operations, catching two companies by surprise and killing 16 men before withdrawing successfully.\n\nWeek Three Casualties: 21 cavalry dead, 17 wounded, plus 47 troops sick with fever or flux\n\nCOMMAND TENT - AUGUST 18, 1432\n\nThe evening sun cast long shadows across the fortified camp. Inside the command tent, Juan's senior officers gathered for assessment. The atmosphere was tense—far different from the triumphant energy of four weeks ago.\n\nÁlvaro de Luna laid out the accounting with characteristic directness:\n\n\"Four Weeks of Operations - July 22 to August 18:\n\nMarch to Granada: 41 dead, 47 wounded\nCamp Establishment: 72 dead, 89 wounded\nCavalry Raiding (3 weeks): 70 cavalry dead, 66 cavalry wounded\nDisease and Heat: 47 seriously ill, 8 dead from sickness\n\nTotal Casualties: 191 dead, 202 wounded, 47 sick (440 casualties total)\n\nCombined Campaign Total Since May: 614 dead, 594 wounded, 47 sick (1,255 casualties)\n\nThe blockade is established but porous. We estimate Granada is still receiving 30-40% of the supplies they would normally access. They have enough food stored to last months even with reduced intake. The Sultan's garrison remains aggressive and effective—they're not cowering behind walls, they're fighting for every resource.\"\n\nThe Master of Calatrava added grimly: \"The morale from Your Majesty's speech sustained us through the worst of the camp establishment, but four weeks of grinding skirmishes is taking its toll. The men aren't breaking, but they're tired. The initial fire is fading into grim determination.\"\n\nDon Fadrique spoke bluntly: \"The cavalry is bleeding, Your Majesty. Not in decisive battles, but in dozens of small skirmishes—two dead here, three wounded there, five ambushed somewhere else. We're losing experienced riders we can't easily replace. And the horses are suffering in this heat—we've lost perhaps 200 horses to exhaustion, heat, and combat.\"\n\nMartín provided intelligence: \"Granada's garrison is approximately 9,500 troops now, down from perhaps 10,000—some casualties, some desertions, some sick. But they remain organized and aggressive. The Sultan is fighting smartly: not trying to defeat us in open battle, but making every operation costly. He's calculating that our will to continue will break before his supplies run out.\"\n\nFray Hernando spoke with pastoral concern: \"The men are also troubled by the nature of this fighting. They expected either glorious battles or siege operations. Instead, it's constant small skirmishes, burning crops, interdicting civilians' food supplies. They understand the military necessity, but... it weighs on them.\"\n\nA messenger arrived—dusty, exhausted. \"Your Majesty, reports from the other fronts: Master of Calatrava has besieged Motril successfully. Infante Juan reports slow but steady progress in the southern valleys—two watchtowers taken, several villages subdued. Both commanders request to know: how proceeds the Granada blockade?\"\n\nÁlvaro looked at Juan. \"Your Majesty, we face strategic choices. The blockade exists but isn't decisive yet. Granada is weakening but slowly—too slowly. Our casualties are mounting in small increments that add up to significant losses. We could:\n\nContinue current operations, accepting the attrition while we wait for the other fronts to complete and Granada to truly starve—potentially months more.\n\nIntensify raiding operations with larger forces, accepting higher casualties to achieve tighter blockade.\n\nPull back to defensive posture around camp, reducing raiding but also reducing our casualties, essentially waiting them out from a safer distance.\n\nSend formal surrender demand now, testing whether they're ready to negotiate rather than continuing this grinding attrition.\"\n\nThe tent was quiet except for the sounds of the vast camp outside—men talking, horses shifting, the clang of a smith's hammer, the groans of wounded in the hospital tents.\n\nWhat do you do?",

They spread a rough map of Granada across the table.\n\nMartín points to the city's layout: \"Your Majesty, Granada has seven main gates and several smaller postern gates. Let me detail what we can and cannot observe.\"\n\nGRANADA'S MAJOR GATES:\n\n1. Bab al-Ramla (Northern Gate - \"Sand Gate\")\n\nThe main gate closest to your current camp position\n\nYou have direct line of sight to this gate from camp\n\nCan observe most traffic and sorties from this gate\n\nThis is where most of the major sorties have originated\n\n2. Bab Ilbira (Northwestern Gate)\n\nPartially visible from your camp's western edge\n\nCan observe some activity but not perfectly\n\nLeads toward mountain passes to the west\n\n3. Bab al-Faraj (Eastern Gate - near Alhambra)\n\nNOT visible from current position\n\nThe Alhambra fortress blocks line of sight\n\nLeads to eastern approaches and mountain routes\n\nSignificant blind spot\n\n4. Bab al-Sharia (Southern Gate - \"Law Gate\")\n\nNOT visible - opposite side of city from your position\n\nLeads toward the southern valleys and coastal routes\n\nComplete blind spot\n\nThis is likely where supply convoys are entering\n\n5-7. Additional Gates (Various positions)\n\nMix of western, southern, and eastern positions\n\nMost not visible from current single camp location\n\nDon Fadrique adds: \"Your Majesty, the fundamental problem is that Granada is enormous—roughly three miles in circumference. Your camp northwest of the city gives excellent observation of the northern and some northwestern approaches, but the eastern, southern, and southeastern sides are completely beyond our observation.\"\n\nHe traces on the map: \"Supply convoys coming from the southern ports—Motril, Salobreña—would naturally enter through the southern gates. We can't see that at all from here. Convoys from the east or southeast through mountain passes? Also invisible to us.\"\n\nThe Master of Calatrava explains the cavalry deployment: \"We've positioned cavalry screens at various points trying to cover the approaches, but with 5,500 cavalry trying to monitor and interdict access to a major city with seven gates and dozens of minor access points across miles of perimeter... it's like trying to catch water in a sieve. We intercept what we can see and reach, but we're not achieving complete observation or interdiction.\"\n\nMartín adds the enemy perspective: \"The Sultan knows exactly where your camp is and what you can observe. He's intelligently routing his supply operations through the blind spots—southern and eastern approaches primarily. He sends sorties from the northern gate because that's where you're positioned and he wants to keep you engaged and bleeding. But the actual supply operations? Those are happening where you can't see them.\"\n\nDon Fadrique summarizes: \"To achieve comprehensive observation and interdiction, Your Majesty would need either:\n\nOption One: Multiple fortified camps positioned around the city—perhaps three or four major positions covering all approaches. This would require dividing your 22,000 troops into 5,000-7,000 per camp. More complete coverage but each position individually weaker and more vulnerable to concentrated sorties.\n\nOption Two: Maintain single strong camp but deploy cavalry in permanent screening positions around entire perimeter—essentially a loose cavalry blockade with the main camp as anchor. This spreads cavalry thin and makes them vulnerable to being defeated piecemeal.\n\nOption Three: Current approach—strong central camp with roving cavalry patrols. Good security for main force but incomplete coverage, which is what we're experiencing.\"\n\nÁlvaro adds: \"Classical siege doctrine calls for complete circumvallation—siege lines completely encircling the target. But Granada is so large that building proper siege lines around the entire city would require perhaps 40,000-50,000 troops and months of construction. We don't have those numbers.\"\n\nThe officers wait for your thoughts on this tactical reality.\n\nHow do you wish to proceed given these observation limitations?",

Food production:\n- The Vega (fertile plain around Granada) - This is OUTSIDE the walls, so Juan's forces can raid/burn it\n- Inside the city walls - limited space for gardens/agriculture, can't feed 50,000 people\n- Southern valleys (Alpujarras) - still in Granada control but Infante Juan is working on subduing them\n\n2. Food storage:\n- They would have stockpiled knowing the crusade was coming\n- Good harvest last year (mentioned by Martín earlier)\n- But feeding 50,000 people burns through stores quickly\n\n3. Import routes:\n- Southern ports (Motril, Salobreña) - Master of Calatrava is besieging them now, but they're CURRENTLY still open\n- Eastern approaches - still theoretically open but very difficult terrain\n- Mountain passes - can get some supplies through but not enough for a city\n\nThe reality should be:\n- Granada can survive for months on current stores\n- The partial blockade is reducing incoming supplies significantly\n- Once the ports fall (September-ish), supplies will be drastically reduced\n- The Alpujarras region can produce some food but not nearly enough for 50,000 people\n- By winter (November-December), food situation should become critical\n- By spring 1433, starvation should be severe\n\nJuan is right that the strategic situation is actually quite good for strangulation - he just needs patience and to maintain pressure while the other operations complete.\n\nLet me have Martín and the advisors explain this clearly.\n\nSTRATEGIC FOOD ASSESSMENT - AUGUST 18, EVENING\n\nMartín steps forward at your question, his knowledge of Granada's situation invaluable. He traces the territory on the map as he explains:\n\n\"Your Majesty asks the essential question. Let me break down Granada's food situation realistically.\"\n\nCURRENT FOOD SOURCES:\n\n1. The Vega (Agricultural Plain)\n\"The vega—the fertile plain immediately around Granada—normally produces the bulk of the city's food. Wheat, barley, vegetables, fruit orchards. In normal times, this could feed Granada's population with surplus to export.\"\n\nHe points to the area around the city. \"But Your Majesty controls this now. Your cavalry has burned 40-50% of the current season's crops. The remainder they're harvesting under armed guard and bringing inside the walls—we've interdicted perhaps half of those attempts. So from the vega, they're getting maybe 25-30% of what they'd normally harvest.\"\n\n2. Stored Supplies\n\"They had warning this crusade was coming. They stockpiled aggressively. Good harvest last year. I estimate they have perhaps 4-6 months of grain and preserved foods stored in the city's granaries and warehouses—enough to feed 50,000 people through autumn and into winter if rationed moderately.\"\n\n3. Southern Ports (Currently Still Open)\n\"This is critical, Your Majesty. Motril and Salobreña are still in Granada's hands—Master of Calatrava is besieging them but hasn't taken them yet. Moroccan ships can still land supplies there. Not massive quantities—these are small ports—but enough to supplement stores. Perhaps 10-15% of Granada's food needs could be met this way while the ports remain open.\"\n\nÁlvaro interjects: \"Master of Calatrava's dispatches estimate he'll have Motril within 2-3 weeks, Salobreña within 4-5 weeks. So call it mid-to-late September before those ports are completely closed.\"\n\nMartín continues: \"Once those ports fall, this 10-15% supply source vanishes.\"\n\n4. The Alpujarras (Southern Mountain Valleys)\n\"The southern valleys—rugged territory between Granada and the coast. Perhaps 20-30 villages, agricultural production in the valleys, livestock in the mountains. This region is still under Granada's nominal control, though Infante Juan is working to subdue it.\"\n\nHe shakes his head. \"But Your Majesty, this region cannot feed Granada city. In normal times, the Alpujarras produces enough to feed its own population—maybe 15,000-20,000 people—with small surplus. It cannot feed an additional 50,000 in the capital. At best, the Alpujarras might supplement Granada's food by 5-10% even if the Sultan controlled it completely.\"\n\n5. Eastern Approaches\n\"Theoretically, supplies could come from the east—from Almería or beyond. But the distances are vast, the terrain is terrible, and Your Majesty's cavalry threatens the routes. Perhaps 2-3% of needs at most could come this way, and at great cost and risk.\"\n\nSUMMARY:\n\nThe Master of Calatrava summarizes: \"So Granada's current food situation:\n\nStored supplies: 4-6 months for 50,000 people (diminishing daily)\n\nCurrent harvest from vega: 25-30% of normal (one-time harvest, already mostly inside walls)\n\nSouthern ports: 10-15% of needs (will end in September when ports fall)\n\nAlpujarras: 5-10% of needs (diminishing as Infante Juan subdues region)\n\nEastern routes: 2-3% of needs (unreliable)\n\nTotal current supply: Stored food slowly depleting, supplemented by perhaps 40-50% of normal incoming supplies (until ports fall, then drops to 15-20%).\"\n\nÁlvaro adds the timeline: \"Your Majesty, the mathematics are straightforward:\n\nAugust: Granada adequately supplied from stores + ports + partial vega harvest + Alpujarras\n\nSeptember: Ports fall. Supply drops significantly. They're living primarily on stores + whatever trickles in from Alpujarras and eastern routes (15-20% of normal).\n\nOctober-November: Stores depleting. Incoming supplies minimal. Rationing becomes severe.\n\nDecember-January: Food situation critical. Stores nearly exhausted, almost nothing coming in, population starving.\n\nFebruary-March 1433: Catastrophic starvation if they haven't surrendered.\"\n\nDon Fadrique adds the military implication: \"Your Majesty, the strategic position is actually quite good. You don't need to achieve a perfect blockade—you just need to maintain pressure while the other operations complete. Once the ports fall and Infante Juan finishes in the south, Granada's food situation becomes hopeless. The current partial blockade is sufficient because there simply aren't enough alternative food sources to sustain 50,000 people indefinitely.\"\n\nMartín nods agreement. \"The Sultan knows this mathematics as well as we do. He's fighting aggressively now because he's trying to either: break your will to continue the blockade, or buy time hoping for external relief that likely won't come. But the fundamental reality is that Granada city cannot feed itself. The vega is outside the walls and you control it. No region they still control can produce enough to matter. Once the ports close, they're doomed—it's just a question of how long their stores last.\"\n\nFray Hernando adds soberly: \"Which means, Your Majesty, that by midwinter, we will be watching a city of 50,000 people—including many women and children—slowly starve. This is the nature of siege warfare, and it is justified when directed against a just military target. But we should be clear-eyed about what we're doing.\"\n\nThe tent is quiet for a moment.\n\nÁlvaro speaks: \"Your Majesty, the strategy is sound. The question is whether you wish to continue current operations—accepting the casualties we're taking in skirmishing—or adjust our approach while we wait for the ports to fall and starvation to do its work.\"\n\nWhat do you want to do?",

We reduce our bleeding while maintaining pressure.\"\n\nThe Master of Calatrava speaks: \"Consolidating cavalry into larger formations—500-800 riders per group instead of 300-400—makes them much harder to ambush. We sacrifice some coverage for survivability. The Sultan's 1,400 cavalry won't dare engage our 800-man formations. We'll interdict less, but we'll lose far fewer men doing it.\"\n\nDon Fadrique adds: \"And frankly, given that the ports are about to fall and the Alpujarras are being subdued, we don't need perfect interdiction. We just need to maintain presence and pressure while time does the work.\"\n\nRegarding the camp improvements, the Master of Calatrava examines the current fortifications: \"We can definitely enhance the defenses. Several options:\n\nElevated Platforms:\nBuild wooden towers at intervals along the palisade—perhaps 15-20 feet high. Position crossbowmen there with clear fields of fire. Benefits: better observation of approaches, extended crossbow range (they can shoot further from elevation), protection for the shooters, psychological deterrent to raids.\n\nStrengthened Walls:\nThicken the earthworks, add additional ditches, plant stakes in approach routes.\n\nInternal Structures:\nBetter organized supply storage, improved hospital facilities, proper command structures. Make the camp more sustainable for long-term occupation.\n\nObservation Posts:\nBuild tall watchtowers—25-30 feet—specifically for observation. Won't help much militarily but would let us see Granada's gates better and track their movements.\"\n\nDon Fadrique estimates: \"Two weeks of construction work with available labor, and we could have 8-10 elevated platforms positioned around the camp perimeter, each holding 10-15 crossbowmen. Plus significantly improved earthworks and internal organization. The camp would transform from 'functional' to 'formidable.'\"\n\nÁlvaro summarizes the strategic picture: \"So the revised approach:\n\nCavalry Operations: Larger formations (500-800 riders), less aggressive but safer. Maintain visible presence and interdict obvious supply attempts, but don't hunt for ambushes.\n\nCamp Development: Two weeks of construction to build elevated platforms, strengthen defenses, improve sustainability.\n\nPosture: Defensive patience. Let the mathematics of starvation work while we minimize our casualties.\n\nTimeline: Ports fall September. Alpujarras subdued October. By November, Granada is truly isolated. By December-January, they're starving. By February, they surrender or face catastrophe.\"\n\nMartín adds: \"Your Majesty, this also has psychological impact on the Sultan. Right now, he sees us bleeding and might calculate we'll lose patience. If we visibly shift to a fortified, patient posture—building permanent structures, settling in for months—he'll understand we're not going anywhere. That realization might prompt earlier negotiations.\"\n\nThe Master of Calatrava nods. \"The elevated platforms especially send a message: 'We're building infrastructure because we're staying until you starve.' Very different from aggressive raiding that suggests we're trying to force quick resolution.\"\n\nFray Hernando speaks: \"This approach is also more morally defensible. We maintain military pressure without excessive aggression, and we offer them clear choice: negotiate now while you have leverage, or wait until starvation forces worse terms. The suffering that follows becomes consequence of their choice, not our cruelty.\"\n\nThe officers await your confirmation of this strategy adjustment.\n\nDo you wish to proceed with this plan?",

Launches massive coordinated sortie (3,000+ troops) targeting camp during construction phase. Overruns one section, destroys platforms under construction, major chaos. 80+ killed, construction set back week+. Defensive strategy appears to have failed. Major morale crisis.\n\n4-8: MAJOR DISASTER\nLarge sortie (1,500+ troops) catches construction crews exposed. Kills 50+ men, destroys completed platforms, burns supplies. Disease outbreak compounds problems (40+ sick). Cavalry formation ambushed despite size (20+ dead). Construction badly delayed. 90+ total casualties. Strategy failing.\n\n9-15: SERIOUS SETBACKS\nMultiple problems: sortie kills 30+ during construction, disease spreads (30+ sick), one large cavalry formation ambushed successfully (15+ casualties). Platform construction behind schedule. Granada supplies flowing freely due to reduced raiding. 70+ casualties. Limited progress.\n\n16-24: SIGNIFICANT COMPLICATIONS\nConstruction proceeds slowly due to harassment (20+ casualties from raids/skirmishes). Disease affects 20+ troops.

Partial success.\n\n25-38: MIXED RESULTS\nConstruction achieves 60-70% of goals—some platforms completed, defenses improved but not finished. Minor raids and skirmishes (15-25 casualties). Disease manageable (10-15 sick). Cavalry intercepts some supplies. Modest progress but incomplete. 40-50 casualties.\n\n39-55: ADEQUATE PROGRESS\nConstruction proceeds reasonably well—6-8 platforms completed, earthworks strengthened. Occasional skirmishing (10-20 casualties). Cavalry's larger formations deter attacks, intercept moderate supplies. Disease minor (5-10 sick). Camp noticeably more defensible. 25-35 casualties. Strategy working adequately.\n\n56-70: GOOD EXECUTION\nConstruction efficient—8-10 platforms completed, camp significantly improved. Minimal combat casualties (8-15). Larger cavalry formations avoid ambushes successfully while maintaining presence. Disease minimal. Camp transformation visible to Granada—psychological impact. 15-25 casualties. Solid progress.\n\n71-82: STRONG PERFORMANCE\nExcellent construction progress—10+ platforms operational, camp fortified impressively. Very low combat casualties (5-10). Cavalry dominates without serious engagement. Disease controlled. Granada makes fewer sortie attempts—appears intimidated by fortifications. Troops' morale improves seeing tangible progress. 10-15 casualties. Strategy working very well.\n\n83-91: EXCELLENT RESULTS\nAll planned fortifications completed ahead of schedule. Minimal casualties (3-8). Cavalry operations so secure Granada stops contesting them. Disease avoided entirely. Camp transformed into impressive fortress. Visible impact on Granada—sorties cease, defensive posture obvious. Morale excellent. Negligible casualties. Outstanding execution.\n\n92-96: EXCEPTIONAL SUCCESS\nPerfect execution. All fortifications completed in 10 days. Zero significant combat casualties (1-3 minor injuries). Cavalry operates freely—Granada's cavalry withdrawn to walls. Construction so impressive that garrison visible demoralized watching it. Some deserters from Granada report morale collapsing. Camp now fortress. Strategic masterpiece.\n\n97-100: STRATEGIC BREAKTHROUGH\nFlawless two weeks. Fortifications completed perfectly. Zero casualties. Granada's garrison so intimidated by display of patient strength that Sultan sends unofficial envoy testing surrender terms. Visible panic in city.

Stop when he needs to make a decision or take action.\n\nTHE FORTIFICATION PERIOD - AUGUST 19 - SEPTEMBER 2, 1432\n\nThe shift in strategy was immediately apparent throughout the camp. On the morning of August 19th, instead of small cavalry companies riding out aggressively to hunt for convoys, larger formations of 600-700 horsemen deployed in coordinated screening positions. The tone changed from hunters to sentinels—visible, powerful, deterring rather than seeking engagement.\n\nMeanwhile, the sound of construction filled the camp. Hammers on wood, saws cutting timber, hundreds of men digging and building under the direction of the army's engineers.\n\nCONSTRUCTION PROGRESS\n\nDays 1-4 (August 19-22):\n\nThe engineers laid out positions for ten elevated platforms around the camp perimeter—each designed to stand eighteen feet high with wooden construction, accessed by ladder, topped with protective wooden walls giving crossbowmen cover while allowing clear fields of fire.\n\nThe first platform went up on the northern edge of camp, facing Granada's main gate. Within two days, it stood complete—a solid structure with room for twelve crossbowmen. From that height, the men could see nearly a mile toward the city walls, and their crossbows had extended effective range.\n\nGranada's garrison tested the new defenses on August 21st. Three hundred cavalry rode out in what appeared to be a probing raid. But as they approached, crossbow bolts began arcing down from the elevated position—farther than they expected, more accurately aimed than ground-level fire. The raid pulled up short, exchanged some ineffective arrow volleys, and withdrew. Five Castilian casualties, perhaps eight Moorish. The platform had proven its worth.\n\nDays 5-9 (August 23-27):\n\nConstruction accelerated as the engineers refined their process. Platforms two through six went up along the western and southern perimeters. Each one manned by experienced crossbowmen who could now observe approaches and provide overlapping fire.\n\nThe earthworks were simultaneously strengthened—ditches deepened, ramparts heightened, approach routes studded with sharpened stakes. What had been a functional military camp was transforming into something more permanent, more formidable.\n\nOn August 25th, a larger sortie—perhaps 600 troops—attempted to disrupt the construction on the southern side. The elevated platforms allowed the defenders to see the sortie forming up at Granada's gate and track its approach. The Castilian response was organized and overwhelming—the sortie was met by prepared heavy infantry with crossbow support from above. The attackers withdrew after a brief engagement, leaving 15 dead. Castilian losses: 4 dead, 7 wounded.\n\nDays 10-14 (August 28 - September 2):\n\nThe final platforms—seven through ten—were completed on the eastern perimeter. Internal camp improvements followed: better organized supply storage with protective covering, expanded hospital facilities with proper ventilation, command structures positioned centrally, clear lanes for troop movement.\n\nBy September 2nd, the transformation was complete. The camp now boasted ten elevated platforms positioned at regular intervals around the perimeter, each manned by ten to twelve crossbowmen. The fortifications were substantially stronger—deeper ditches, higher earthworks, multiple defensive layers. The internal organization was professional and sustainable for long-term occupation.\n\nFrom Granada's walls, the change must have been psychologically striking. What had been a military encampment now looked like permanent infrastructure—like the Castilians were building a fortress to sit there indefinitely.\n\nConstruction Casualties: 6 dead (accidents and minor skirmishes), 9 wounded\n\nCAVALRY OPERATIONS\n\nThe larger cavalry formations proved dramatically safer. Companies of 600-700 horsemen moving in coordinated patterns were simply too formidable for Granada's 1,400 cavalry to engage directly.\n\nOn August 23rd, a Moorish cavalry force of approximately 400 riders appeared on a ridgeline, observing a Castilian formation moving to interdict a suspected supply route. For several minutes, both sides watched each other across a half-mile of open ground. Then the Moorish cavalry withdrew without engagement—the mathematics were too unfavorable.\n\nThe pattern repeated throughout the two weeks. The Castilian cavalry maintained visible presence, patrolled approach routes, and intercepted what they could reach—but they didn't hunt aggressively into ambush terrain. The Granada cavalry contested less and less, preserving their strength behind the walls.\n\nResults were modest but sustainable: perhaps three small supply convoys intercepted, several hundred more acres burned in accessible areas, constant pressure maintained. More importantly, casualties were minimal.\n\nCavalry Operations Casualties: 3 dead, 5 wounded (all from minor skirmishes at distance)\n\nDISEASE AND HEAT\n\nThe cooler temperatures of early September helped considerably. The brutal August heat began breaking, making camp life more bearable. The improved camp organization—better water discipline, properly dug latrines, ventilated hospital tents—kept disease manageable.\n\nEight men fell seriously ill with summer fever, but proper care in the improved facilities meant only one death. The medical situation remained under control.\n\nDisease Casualties: 1 dead, 7 seriously ill\n\nPSYCHOLOGICAL IMPACT\n\nThe most significant development was what could be seen from Granada's walls.\n\nBy late August, the defenders watching from their ramparts saw a Castilian army that wasn't attacking, wasn't bleeding itself in aggressive operations, wasn't showing signs of frustration or impatience. Instead, they saw:\n\nPermanent elevated platforms rising around a fortified camp\n\nOrganized, disciplined construction work\n\nLarge cavalry formations operating with professional caution\n\nAn army settling in as if prepared to wait months—or years\n\nOn August 29th, observers reported that the frequency of Granada's sorties had decreased noticeably. Where previously the garrison launched aggressive raids every two to three days, now several days would pass with no activity beyond sentries on the walls.\n\nDon Fadrique's scouts reported on September 1st: \"The mood on their walls has changed, Your Majesty. Less defiance, more... watching. Waiting. They're seeing us build infrastructure for a long siege, and they're calculating what that means.\"\n\nSTATUS REPORT - SEPTEMBER 2, EVENING\n\nThe sun set over the completed fortifications as Álvaro de Luna assembled the latest reports in Juan's command tent—now a more permanent structure with proper flooring and walls.\n\nTwo-Week Operations Summary (August 19 - September 2):\n\nConstruction:\n\n10 elevated crossbow platforms completed (120+ crossbowmen elevated)\n\nSubstantially improved earthworks and defenses\n\nReorganized internal camp structure\n\nCamp transformed into fortified position suitable for months-long occupation\n\nCombat Operations:\n\nCavalry: 3 dead, 5 wounded\n\nInfantry skirmishing: 6 dead, 9 wounded\n\nDisease: 1 dead, 7 ill (recovering)\n\nTotal: 10 dead, 21 wounded or ill (31 casualties)\n\nCompared to Previous Three Weeks: 191 dead, 202 wounded, 47 sick—the new strategy reduced casualties by approximately 85%\n\nGranada's Response:\n\nSortie frequency decreased significantly\n\nCavalry avoiding engagement with larger Castilian formations\n\nVisible shift from aggressive to defensive posture\n\nPsychological impact evident—garrison watching, calculating\n\nExternal Operations:\n\nMaster of Calatrava reports Motril under heavy bombardment, breach expected within days\n\nInfante Juan reports four watchtowers taken, six villages subdued in southern valleys\n\nBoth operations proceeding on schedule\n\nÁlvaro looked up from the reports: \"Your Majesty, the strategy is working. We're losing ten men per two weeks instead of ninety. The camp is now highly defensible. Granada is visibly affected by our patient posture. And most critically—\" he pointed to the dispatch from the coast \"—Motril is about to fall. Once that port closes, Granada's supply situation becomes genuinely critical.\"\n\nThe Master of Calatrava added: \"The platforms are excellent. Crossbowmen love them—better visibility, extended range, protection. Any sortie now faces coordinated fire from multiple elevated positions. Granada has learned this is no longer profitable.\"\n\nDon Fadrique reported on morale: \"The troops responded well to the construction work. Gave them tangible progress to see—'we built this fortress'—rather than just bleeding in skirmishes. Morale is steady, sustainable. They understand we're settling in for the duration.\"\n\nOutside, the evening watch climbed the ladders to the elevated platforms. Crossbowmen took their positions, looking out across the darkening plain toward Granada's walls, where torches were beginning to flicker.\n\nThe camp was quiet, organized, patient. A fortress preparing for a long wait.\n\nWhat do you do?",

      "text": "1. Roll 74 for Alhama bombardment - solid, better than expected\n2. Roll 89 for garrison response - excellent, immediate willingness to negotiate\n3. Roll 93 for the speech - legendary moment, one of the best rolls of the campaign\n4. Roll 1 for the three-pronged offensive - catastrophic disaster, worst possible result\n5. Roll 28 for establishing blockade at Granada - significant difficulties\n6. Roll 30 for Iznalloz fall and positioning - more delays and difficulties\n7. Roll 61 for fortification period - good execution, finally some relief\n\nSo the user is right - after that amazing speech roll (93), they got hit with a catastrophic 1, then struggled through the 20s and 30s, before finally getting back to a decent 61. That's genuinely unlucky sequencing, especially since the 1 came right after planning what seemed like a solid strategy.\n\nBut here's what's interesting from a narrative perspective: this created one of the most compelling arcs of the campaign. The emotional roller coaster - triumph of the speech, disaster of the offensive, grinding difficulty of establishing position, finally finding sustainable approach - is much more interesting than if everything had gone smoothly.\n\nThe 1 roll in particular was devastating but created real tension and forced strategic adaptation. And the player's response was excellent - recognizing the failure, withdrawing, consolidating, shifting strategy. That showed real maturity as a strategic leader.\n\nI should acknowledge the frustration while also highlighting how this created a better story than smooth sailing would have.\n\nYou're absolutely right - this chapter was a brutal dice sequence! Let's look at what you rolled:\n\nThe Roller Coaster:\n\nAlhama bombardment: 74 (strong, ahead of schedule)\n\nGarrison response: 89 (excellent, immediate negotiations)\n\nTHE SPEECH: 93 (legendary, one of the best moments of the campaign)\n\nThree-pronged offensive: 1 (💀 worst possible result, complete disaster)\n\nMarch and positioning at Granada: 30 (significant delays and difficulties)\n\nFortification period: 61 (finally! good execution)\n\nSo after that incredible 93 for the speech - which created this amazing moment of inspiration and conviction - you immediately rolled a 1 on the very next major action. That's genuinely painful timing. You went from \"they would march on Hell itself!\" to losing 480 casualties with zero objectives achieved in the span of one roll.\n\nAnd then you spent the next month+ of game time (rolls 30, 28, 30 again) grinding through the 20s-30s range, just getting beaten down by attrition and guerrilla warfare.\n\nBut here's the thing: This created one of the most compelling narrative arcs of the entire campaign. Consider:\n\nThe speech (93) - Inspirational triumph, peak confidence\n\nThe disaster (1) - Immediate hubris punishment, reality check\n\nThe grind (30s) - Testing whether that inspiration could survive adversity\n\nThe adaptation (61) - Finally finding sustainable approach through wisdom\n\nIf you'd rolled high throughout, it would've been: \"Great speech → easy encirclement → quick victory.\" Instead you got: \"Great speech → catastrophic failure → hard-won strategic maturity → patient path to victory.\"\n\nThe Strategic Growth:\n\nWhat I found most impressive was how you responded to the 1. You:\n\nImmediately recognized the strategy wasn't working\n\nWithdrew from failed positions without stubbornly persisting\n\nConsolidated forces instead of doubling down\n\nShifted from aggressive to patient approach\n\nPrioritized sustainability over rapid results\n\nThat's actually better kingship than if everything had gone smoothly. Juan learned something through failure.\n\nThe Mathematical Reality:\n\nAnd here's the other thing - even with those rough rolls, you're actually in a winning position. By September 1432:\n\nGranada is isolated\n\nFood math is inexorable (they starve by spring 1433)\n\nYour casualties stabilized (10 dead per 2 weeks vs. 90)\n\nThe blockade doesn't need to be perfect\n\nTime is your ally\n\nThe 1 and the subsequent low rolls made it harder and bloodier than it should've been, but they didn't change the fundamental outcome. You're still going to win - it's just taking until 1433 instead of autumn 1432.\n\nThe Drama:\n\nFrom a storytelling perspective, this chapter had everything:\n\nLegendary inspirational moment (the speech)\n\nCrushing defeat (the 1)\n\nGrinding adversity (the 30s)\n\nStrategic adaptation (shifting approaches)\n\nHard-won wisdom (fortification strategy)\n\nClear path to victory (mathematical strangulation)\n\nIf you'd rolled 80+ throughout, it would've been \"and then Juan easily won.\" Instead you got a real war arc with setbacks and adaptation.\n\nLooking Forward:\n\nThe good news: You're set up well for Chapter 38. The worst is genuinely behind you. Granada's food situation deteriorates regardless of what you roll. The ports fall, the southern valleys get subdued, and by December-January they're desperate.\n\nYou've also established a sustainable strategy - you're not bleeding 200 casualties per month anymore. The fortified camp, larger cavalry formations, and patient approach mean you can wait them out.\n\nSo yes, you got hammered by the dice this chapter (that 1 followed by months of 30s was brutal), but you also showed excellent strategic decision-making in response. And you're positioned to win - it just won't be as quick or clean as originally hoped.\n\nWant to talk about any specific decisions or moments from the chapter? Or are you ready to start Chapter 38 and see if your dice luck improves?",
