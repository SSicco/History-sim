      "text": "**Current Date:** Mid-January 1438, midday\n**Location:** Toledo, Alcázar, Solar\n**Present:** Juan, Don Álvaro de Luna, Diego de Daza, Captain Fernán de Vargas, Isaac de Baeza\n**Situation:** Fleet review and strategic planning session has just concluded. The Combined Fleet Assessment document has been approved.\n\nThe chapter ended with the planning session concluded - so I need to pick up right there, with the advisors present and the meeting apparently wrapping up. The narrative should place us at the moment where the formal business has concluded but people are still present.\n\nLet me write the chapter introduction following the skill format.\n\nChapter 2.46\n\nMid-January 1438, Midday\n\nThe solar's hearth crackles softly, the only sound now that the scratch of Diego de Daza's quill has ceased. The Combined Fleet Assessment lies before you on the map table—rolled parchment weighted with brass lions at either end, the ink barely dry on projections that stretch to 1443 and beyond. Five years of naval expansion, troop transport capacity, Constantinople's transformation into a proper Christian naval base. The numbers tell a story of patient accumulation, of scattered power slowly gathering toward a single purpose.\n\nDon Álvaro de Luna stands by the window, gazing out at Toledo's winter sky, his hands clasped behind his back. Captain Fernán de Vargas has pushed back from the table, his weathered face thoughtful, still turning over the implications of what the Ottoman intelligence revealed—eighty-five to one hundred vessels at Gallipoli, methodically built, methodically crewed, waiting. Isaac de Baeza remains seated in the shadows near the door, his dark eyes watchful as always, ready to withdraw now that his report has been delivered.\n\nThe formal assessment is complete. Seven years remain on the Tenedos truce. Outside, a servant's footsteps echo in the corridor, and somewhere deeper in the Alcázar, a child laughs—perhaps Teresa, perhaps Juana, the sound bright against the winter stone.",

I need a dedicated administrator for each of there regions. One who is dedicated to the region and is in residence at all times. Then I want another central administration as well that oversees each of these regions. I place you in charge of this administration and Diego as well.\n\n\nI want to implement the system of crown marshalls and crown tax assessors in all these regions. I know that the crown has different rights in Aragon but they will move within their authority when they are there. We use the existing palaces or administration buildings we already have there to house and let the governors work there. They are there for a set amount of time until we replace them.\n\n\nWhat do you think?",

      "text": "Juan is proposing a significant administrative reform - creating a centralized imperial administration across all his territories (Castile, Granada, Aragon, Naples, and Constantinople). He wants:\n\n1. A dedicated resident administrator/governor for each region\n2. A central administration overseeing all regions (with Álvaro and Diego in charge)\n3. Extension of the crown marshall and crown tax assessor system to all regions\n4. Recognition that Aragon has different constitutional arrangements (the fueros)\n5. Term limits for governors\n\nThis is a major proposal. Let me think about how Álvaro de Luna would react:\n\nÁlvaro is:\n- Brilliant administrator and political strategist\n- Absolutely loyal to Juan\n- Provides frank, wise counsel even when challenging Juan's ideas\n- Patient mentor evolved to equal partner\n\nHe would likely:\n1. See the wisdom in centralizing administration\n2. But raise practical concerns about:\n   - Aragonese fueros and constitutional limitations\n   - Naples being under Alfonso V's direct rule (Juan is heir presumptive, not king)\n   - Constantinople's unique status under the Palaiologos\n   - Finding qualified personnel\n   - Cost implications\n\nLet me think about the political realities:\n\n**Castile** - Juan is king, full authority. This works.\n\n**Granada** - Conquered territory, Juan has full authority. This works.\n\n**Aragon** - Juan is NOT king of Aragon. Alfonso V is. Juan has claims and influence, but he doesn't actually rule Aragon. The fueros also limit royal power significantly. This is a problem.\n\n**Naples** - Alfonso V is king of Naples (after the succession war). Juan is heir presumptive because Alfonso has no children, but Juan doesn't currently rule Naples. This is also a problem.\n\n**Constantinople** - John VIII Palaiologos is Emperor. Juan is \"Defensor Romaniae\" - a defender/protector role, not ruler. The Taktikon and other agreements give him certain rights, but he's not the sovereign. Another problem.\n \nI see Juan's administrative proposal faces significant legal and political obstacles. He's attempting to govern territories where he lacks direct sovereign authority. Álvaro would carefully highlight these jurisdictional challenges, emphasizing the diplomatic and legal complexities of implementing such a sweeping administrative reform across multiple independent or semi-independent regions.\n\nThe succession timeline for Naples is particularly critical. With Giovanna II's expected death in Autumn 1435, the political landscape might be shifting, potentially altering Juan's potential claims and administrative strategies.\n\nÁlvaro's counsel would be nuanced - respectfully challenging Juan's vision while providing pragmatic insights into the constitutional realities that could undermine his proposed governance approach.\n\nDon Álvaro turns from the window, his expression shifting from contemplation to the focused attention he reserves for matters of state. He exchanges a brief glance with Diego de Daza before approaching the table.\n\n\"Your Majesty speaks of empire,\" he says carefully, his voice measured. \"And the vision is sound—unified administration, consistent standards, governors who answer to Toledo. In principle, I could not agree more.\"\n\nHe pauses, choosing his next words with the precision of a man who has navigated court politics for decades.\n\n\"But I must speak plainly, as you have always permitted me to do. Of the five territories you name, Your Majesty rules two: Castile and Granada. These are yours by right of inheritance and conquest. Crown marshalls, tax assessors, resident governors—all of this can be implemented by royal decree.\"\n\nÁlvaro moves to the map spread beneath the fleet assessment, his finger tracing the Mediterranean.\n\n\"Aragon belongs to King Alfonso. Naples belongs to King Alfonso. Constantinople belongs to Emperor John. Your Majesty holds the title Defensor Romaniae, not Basileus. You are heir presumptive to Alfonso's realms, not their sovereign.\" He looks up, meeting your eyes directly. \"To appoint governors to kingdoms you do not yet rule would be... premature. And it would alarm the very allies whose cooperation you require.\"\n\nDiego de Daza clears his throat softly. \"The Aragonese Cortes would view such appointments as an invasion of their fueros, Your Majesty. Even if couched as 'coordination' rather than governance.\"\n\nÁlvaro nods. \"What Your Majesty can do is prepare. Build the framework for Castile and Granada now. Identify the men who might one day serve as governors elsewhere. And when—God willing—the succession comes, the apparatus will be ready.\"\n\nHe folds his arms. \"Unless Your Majesty intends something more... immediate?\"",

      "text": "1. **Castile and Granada** - Juan rules directly as king\n2. **Aragon** - Juan inherited after Alfonso V died in September 1437. He negotiated with the Cortes in Chapter 2.42 and was working toward coronation\n3. **Naples** - Juan inherited after Alfonso V died. Roll 99 meant triumphant inheritance - Neapolitan lords declared for Juan as \"il Liberatore\" before he even pressed the claim\n4. **Constantinople** - Juan has near-complete control through the Chrysobull of the United Treasury. He can appoint a Sakellarios (administrator) with the Emperor's consultation. The Emperor receives a 22,000 florin stipend but Juan controls the treasury and administration.\n\nSo Juan is correct - he does rule these territories now. Alfonso V died in September 1437, and by January 1438 (the current date), Juan has inherited Aragon and Naples. And he has administrative control over Constantinople through the joint treasury arrangement.\n\nLet me revise Álvaro's response to reflect this accurate political situation. He should instead focus on the practical challenges of implementing such an administrative system across very different kingdoms with different constitutional arrangements.\n\nThank you for the correction. Let me re-read the situation properly and provide an accurate response.\n\nDon Álvaro turns from the window, his expression shifting to one of careful consideration. He exchanges a glance with Diego de Daza before approaching the table.\n\n\"Five crowns,\" he says, his voice measured but approving. \"Castile, Granada, Aragon, Naples, and the administration of Constantinople. Your Majesty speaks of empire in fact, not merely in aspiration.\" He pauses, then nods slowly. \"The vision is sound. Unified standards, resident governors who answer to Toledo, crown marshalls and assessors extending the reforms that have served Castile so well.\"\n\nDiego de Daza leans forward, his administrator's mind already working through the details. \"For Castile and Granada, implementation is straightforward—royal decree, as we have already done. Constantinople likewise operates under the Chrysobull; the Emperor must approve appointments by consultation, but as Your Majesty says, Sphrantzes has proven cooperative.\"\n\n\"The complications,\" Álvaro interjects, \"lie in Aragon and Naples.\" He moves to the map. \"Your Majesty swore the coronation oath at Zaragoza. The fueros bind the crown to use only Aragonese officials in Aragonese lands. Crown marshalls appointed from Toledo would violate the very compact that secured the throne.\"\n\n\"The same difficulty exists in Naples,\" Diego adds. \"The Neapolitan baronage declared for Your Majesty as il Liberatore—but they expect a viceroy of Italian blood, not Castilian administrators collecting taxes.\"\n\nÁlvaro strokes his beard. \"What Your Majesty can do is appoint governors who answer to Toledo while respecting local forms. An Aragonese justiciar coordinating with your central administration. A Neapolitan viceroy who reports to Don Diego's office. The substance of unified governance, clothed in local dress.\"\n\nHe looks at you directly. \"Who does Your Majesty have in mind for these positions?\"",

This is a conversation, so I should keep it relatively short and let the player continue directing.\n\nÁlvaro's eyes sharpen with approval. \"Wise. A powerful baron appointed governor becomes a king in all but name. A lesser man owes everything to Your Majesty's favor—and knows it.\"\n\n\"The Aragonese call it the política de los menores,\" Diego adds. \"The old Castilian kings used it before the civil wars. Elevate capable men of modest birth, and they serve the crown because the crown is the source of their authority. Elevate a grandee, and he serves himself.\"\n\nCaptain Fernán, who has remained silent through the administrative discussion, clears his throat. \"Your Majesty might also consider men who have proven themselves in your service abroad. Knights who distinguished themselves at Constantinople or Naples. They have no local faction to appease, no old grudges to nurse—only loyalty to the crown that raised them.\"\n\nÁlvaro nods slowly. \"For Constantinople, the choice is simpler. Sphrantzes already administers the treasury competently. A Castilian observer—perhaps one of the knights who remained with the garrison—could coordinate with Toledo without disturbing arrangements that function well.\"\n\nDiego pulls a blank sheet toward him, quill ready. \"Shall I draw up a list of candidates for Your Majesty's consideration? For each territory, we might identify three or four men of appropriate rank and proven capability. Lesser nobles, certainly. Perhaps some administrators who have served well in the reform program here in Castile.\" He glances up. \"Does Your Majesty wish to begin with any particular territory? Or shall we survey all five systematically?\"",

What local considerations apply?\n\nLet me search the project knowledge for characters who might be candidates, and also think about what Diego and Álvaro would realistically suggest.\n\nI should have Diego start taking notes and have the NPCs discuss candidates. This is a good opportunity for the player to learn about various characters and make decisions. I should present options and let Juan choose.\n\nLet me think about who we know:\n- From Castile: Various nobles mentioned, the Mendoza family, administrators\n- From Aragon: Various nobles encountered during the Cortes negotiations\n- From Naples: Neapolitan barons who swore fealty\n- From Constantinople: Greek nobles, Latin settlers, Military Order members\n\nI should search for more specific character information to give realistic candidates.\n\nDiego dips his quill and draws five columns across the parchment, labeling each with careful script: Castilla, Granada, Aragón, Nápoles, Constantinopla.\n\n\"Let us proceed systematically,\" Álvaro says, moving to stand beside Diego where he can see the emerging document. \"Each territory has different requirements. Castile is the seat of power—it needs no governor, only the continuation of the royal council. But the others...\"\n\nHe begins to pace, thinking aloud.\n\n\"Granada requires a man who can manage a conquered population—firm but not cruel, capable of working with the remaining Mudéjar communities while ensuring Christian authority. Someone military, I think, given the frontier nature of the territory.\"\n\n\"Aragon demands an Aragonese,\" Diego notes. \"The fueros are explicit. But a lesser Aragonese—one who will not use the position to build a rival power base. Someone who proved loyal during the succession negotiations, perhaps.\"\n\n\"Naples is the most delicate,\" Álvaro continues. \"The barons expect one of their own, but they are a nest of vipers. An outsider they would resent; one of their peers they would suborn. Perhaps... an Italian who is not Neapolitan? Someone from the Papal States or the north, with no existing ties to the factions?\"\n\nIsaac de Baeza, still seated in the shadows, speaks for the first time since delivering his intelligence report. \"Constantinople is different still. The Greeks will not accept a Latin governor—but they will accept a Latin coordinator who works alongside Sphrantzes. One of the knights who remained with the garrison, as the Captain suggested, would serve well.\"\n\nDiego looks up from the parchment. \"Shall I search the rolls for specific names, Your Majesty? Men who have served in the reform program, knights who distinguished themselves in the campaigns, lesser nobles who have shown administrative capability?\"\n\n1. **Castile** - Doesn't need a governor, it's the seat of power with Álvaro and Diego\n2. **Granada** - Needs a military man who can manage conquered population\n3. **Aragon** - Needs an Aragonese, lesser noble\n4. **Naples** - Italian but not Neapolitan\n5. **Constantinople** - Latin coordinator working with Sphrantzes\n\nLet me search for more specific candidates, particularly for Aragon (from the coronation chapters) and Naples.\n\n**For Granada:**\n- Need a military man, firm but fair, can manage Mudéjar population\n- Possible: Captain Gonzalo de Córdoba (royal guards commander), someone from the Military Orders\n\n**For Aragon:**\n- Must be Aragonese per the fueros\n- Lesser nobles who proved loyal\n- Don Bernat de Centelles (supporter, was Alfonso's ambassador)\n- Possibly Don Pedro de Luna (cautious but supportive)\n- NOT Don Juan de Híjar (hostile) or Don Felipe de Castro (opportunistic)\n\n**For Naples:**\n- Should be Italian but NOT Neapolitan\n- Perhaps someone from the Papal States or northern Italy\n- Could look at people connected to Lucia d'Este (Ferrara connections)\n\n**For Constantinople:**\n- Latin coordinator working with Sphrantzes\n- One of the knights who remained with the garrison\n- Don Juan de Sotomayor is the Master of Alcántara commanding forces there, but he's too important\n- Need someone more junior\n\nLet me have the NPCs discuss these options and present candidates.\n\nDiego nods and begins writing rapidly, his quill scratching across the parchment as Álvaro, Captain Fernán, and Isaac contribute their knowledge.\n\nGRANADA\n\n\"Granada requires military experience above all,\" Álvaro begins. \"The population is still largely Mudéjar. The man must command respect without provoking rebellion.\"\n\nDiego writes as the names emerge:\n\nDon García López de Padilla — Current military governor of Granada, a Calatrava knight. Has served competently since the conquest. Lesser branch of the Padilla family, owes his position entirely to the crown. Advantage: Already in place, knows the territory. Concern: May have grown too comfortable; no incentive to implement new reforms.\n\nDon Fadrique Enríquez de Mendoza — Cavalry commander who distinguished himself at Naples. House Mendoza connection gives him weight, but he is a younger son with no inheritance of his own. Advantage: Proven in battle, loyal. Concern: Mendoza ties could create factional complications.\n\nCaptain Gonzalo de Córdoba — Commander of the crown soldiers and your personal guard. Young, capable, devoted. Advantage: Absolute loyalty, no competing interests. Concern: Perhaps too young; removing him from Toledo leaves you without your best captain.\n\nIsaac speaks from the shadows. \"There is also Martín de Córdoba—the commander you sent to Morocco for intelligence. He spent months among Muslims, learned their ways, earned respect even from enemies. The freed prisoners spoke well of him.\"\n\nARAGON\n\n\"The fueros require an Aragonese native,\" Diego notes. \"But we have some choices among those who proved loyal during the succession.\"\n\nDon Bernat de Centelles — Alfonso's former ambassador, active supporter throughout the Cortes negotiations. Advocated for the registry. Advantage: Known quantity, genuinely supportive of Your Majesty's vision. Concern: His support was so visible that appointing him might look like rewarding a faction.\n\nDon Pedro de Luna — The Luna family learned caution from the antipope scandal. Appreciated Your Majesty's restraint regarding the Justicia. Lesser branch, modest holdings. Advantage: Respected name, no factional ambitions. Concern: May be too cautious, too passive.\n\nA suggestion from the merchants' circle — Álvaro raises an eyebrow. \"Guillem de Santcliment of Valencia showed sharp intelligence during the negotiations. Not a noble, but the fueros do not require nobility for all offices—only that the officeholder be Aragonese.\"\n\n\"That would be unprecedented,\" Diego murmurs.\n\n\"So was everything else Your Majesty did at Zaragoza,\" Álvaro replies.\n\nNAPLES\n\n\"Naples is treacherous ground,\" Isaac says quietly. \"The barons declared for Your Majesty as il Liberatore—but they expect to be courted, not governed.\"\n\nAn Italian who is not Neapolitan — Álvaro strokes his beard. \"The Queen's family offers possibilities. The d'Este of Ferrara are respected throughout Italy, and Her Majesty's connections could smooth the appointment.\"\n\nDiego adds: \"There is also the matter of the Church. A cardinal-legate governing in Your Majesty's name would carry weight that no mere baron could match.\"\n\nIsaac shakes his head slightly. \"Cardinals answer to Rome. Better a secular governor who answers only to Toledo.\"\n\nTommaso Parentucelli — The name hangs in the air. \"He is not a governor,\" Álvaro says carefully, \"but he has Your Majesty's trust and knows Italian politics intimately. He might recommend someone.\"\n\n\"We should write to him,\" Diego agrees. \"And perhaps to Queen Lucia's uncle in Ferrara. The Marchese d'Este would know which Italian families produce capable administrators without dangerous ambitions.\"\n\nCONSTANTINOPLE\n\n\"Sphrantzes administers the treasury competently,\" Álvaro says. \"What Constantinople needs is not a replacement but a liaison—someone who coordinates with Toledo, ensures our interests are represented, and reports honestly on conditions.\"\n\nA knight from the garrison — Captain Fernán speaks up. \"The Military Orders have maintained discipline under Don Juan de Sotomayor. Several of his captains have distinguished themselves. I could write to the Master requesting names of men suited for administrative work rather than purely martial duties.\"\n\nIsaac adds: \"There is also Demetrios Chrysoloras—your Chief Justice of the Tribunal Latinorum. He drafted the Constitution of Contributions and Claims. Greek by birth, but serves Your Majesty's vision. He could coordinate between Latin and Greek administration.\"\n\n\"A Greek coordinating Latin interests?\" Álvaro raises an eyebrow.\n\n\"A Greek who chose to serve the Defensor,\" Isaac replies. \"His loyalty is to the arrangement, not to any faction.\"\n\nDiego looks up from the list. \"Shall I send inquiries, Your Majesty? To Parentucelli regarding Naples, to Master Sotomayor regarding Constantinople, to Queen María regarding which Aragonese candidates might serve best?\"",

Constantinople: Whoever has military command serves as liaison - currently that would be Don Juan de Sotomayor, Master of Alcántara\n\nLet me have the NPCs react to these decisions appropriately. Some of these are straightforward, others are more complex.\n\nFor Aragon - choosing a merchant is genuinely unprecedented and will raise eyebrows.

They might need to research or propose someone.\n\nFor Constantinople - Sotomayor is the current commander, so he would be the liaison. This is practical.\n\nLet me write the NPC responses appropriately.\n\nÁlvaro nods at each decision, though his eyebrows rise slightly at the Aragonese appointment.\n\n\"Don García remains in Granada—wise. The man knows his territory, and change for its own sake breeds instability.\" He glances at Diego. \"Send word confirming his position and informing him of the new administrative structure. He should understand he now reports to a central authority here in Toledo, not merely to the crown in general.\"\n\nDiego makes a note, then pauses at the second name. \"Guillem de Santcliment.\" He sets down his quill. \"Your Majesty understands this will cause... comment. A merchant governing a kingdom, even in a coordinating role—\"\n\n\"Not governing,\" Álvaro interjects, his mind already working through the implications. \"Administering. Coordinating. The Justicia still stands, the Cortes still meets, the fueros remain inviolate. Santcliment would be Your Majesty's eyes and ears, ensuring the registry functions, that the voluntary muster system operates as designed.\" He strokes his beard slowly. \"In truth... it may be brilliant. The Aragonese nobles will not fear a merchant the way they would fear a rival baron. And the merchants themselves will see one of their own elevated—proof that Your Majesty values commerce as much as lineage.\"\n\n\"He will need a title,\" Diego says practically. \"Some office that the fueros recognize. Perhaps Procurador Real—Royal Procurator. It exists in Valencian law, a crown representative for administrative matters.\"\n\n\"Write to him,\" Álvaro agrees. \"Sound him out carefully. A man offered such elevation may refuse from modesty or accept from ambition—we must know which before any public announcement.\"\n\nFor Naples, Isaac speaks from the shadows. \"A modest baron, loyal, no factional ties.\" He considers. \"The Neapolitan baronage is a snake pit, but there are a few houses that supported King Alfonso from the beginning—before the victory was certain. Men who risked everything on the Aragonese cause when René of Anjou seemed likely to prevail.\"\n\n\"We should write to Queen María,\" Álvaro suggests. \"She knows the Italian nobility from Alfonso's years of campaigning. And to Parentucelli—he spent years in the papal curia, watching Italian families rise and fall. Between them, they can identify a man of modest standing who owes everything to the Trastámara cause.\"\n\nDiego adds the names to his list of inquiries. \"I will request specific recommendations: a baron of the second rank, no blood ties to the great feuding houses, proven loyalty during the succession wars. Someone who will be grateful for elevation rather than resentful of oversight.\"\n\n\"For Constantinople, the military commander serves as liaison.\" Álvaro nods. \"That would be Don Juan de Sotomayor, Master of Alcántara. He has commanded the garrison since the beginning—four years now. He knows Sphrantzes, knows the Greeks, knows the walls and the threats.\"\n\nCaptain Fernán speaks up. \"The Master is no administrator, but he is honest and practical. He will report what he sees without embellishment. And if the command rotates—as Your Majesty suggests it might—the new commander inherits the liaison role. Simple, clear, no confusion about authority.\"\n\n\"Sphrantzes handles the treasury,\" Diego summarizes, writing. \"The military commander coordinates with Toledo. The Emperor approves appointments as the Chrysobull requires. The structure is sound.\"\n\nÁlvaro steps back, surveying the emerging framework. \"Five territories. Four governors—Granada, Aragon, Naples, Constantinople—plus Castile administered directly through the royal council. Crown marshalls and tax assessors extending into each realm as local law permits.\" He looks at you. \"This is the skeleton of an empire, Your Majesty. It will take years to put flesh on the bones—but the structure is sound.\"\n\nDiego finishes his notes and looks up. \"Shall I draft the formal letters today? To Don García confirming his position, to Santcliment sounding out his willingness, to Queen María and Parentucelli requesting Neapolitan recommendations, and to Master Sotomayor informing him of his additional duties as liaison?\"",

His voice is carefully neutral, but his eyes are sharp, assessing. \"Your Majesty intends to... step back from direct rule of your own kingdom?\"\n\nDiego sets down his quill entirely. \"Your Majesty, the Castilian nobility has accepted much these past five years. The crown marshalls, the tax assessors, the Military Orders brought under royal authority, the crusade taxation. They accepted these things because they came from their king, ruling his kingdom.

An empire where no single kingdom dominates, where all are equal under one crown. It is... Roman, in its conception. But Rome had centuries to build such structures. And Rome had legions to enforce them.\"\n\nCaptain Fernán clears his throat. \"The nobility accepted Your Majesty's reforms because they trusted you. A governor—even a capable one—does not carry that trust.\"\n\nIsaac, ever practical, offers a different angle. \"Perhaps the question is not whether Castile has a governor, but what the governor is called. Adelantado Mayor. Mayordomo del Reino. A title that sounds like elevation of an existing office rather than... diminishment of the kingdom.\"\n\nA servant is dispatched, and within minutes, Queen María enters the solar. Alfonso's widow has aged gracefully in the months since Zaragoza—her mourning black has softened to deep purple, and her eyes, though touched with grief, remain sharp and perceptive. She spent decades navigating Italian courts alongside her husband; few living people understand Mediterranean politics as intimately.\n\n\"Your Majesty summoned me?\" She inclines her head, taking in the assembled council with a quick glance. \"I see maps and lists. You are building something.\"\n\nÁlvaro briefly explains the administrative framework—five territories, five governors, unified oversight from Toledo.\n\nMaría listens without interruption, her expression thoughtful. When he finishes, she moves to the table, studying Diego's notes.\n\n\"Naples,\" she murmurs. \"You want a modest baron, loyal, no factional ties.\" She is quiet for a long moment, memories of years spent in Italian courts flickering behind her eyes.\n\n\"There are three possibilities,\" she says finally. \"Men I watched during Alfonso's campaigns. Men who chose our cause when choosing was still dangerous.\"\n\nShe traces a finger across the map toward the Italian peninsula.\n\n\"Don Antonio de Cardona. A Catalan, not Neapolitan—but he administered Sicilian estates for Alfonso competently for eight years. The Neapolitans know him, respect him, but he has no local faction to serve. His family holds modest lands near Tarragona; he owes everything to the Trastámara cause.\"\n\n\"Marino Brancaccio. Neapolitan by birth, but from a lesser branch of the family. He held Castel dell'Ovo against René's forces for three weeks after Aversa—surrendered only when Alfonso himself sent word that honor had been satisfied. Brave, stubborn, and—importantly—poor. His loyalty is to the crown that might elevate him, not to cousins who look down on him.\"\n\n\"Giovanni di Ventimiglia. Sicilian, served as Alfonso's captain of the guard in the later years. Not brilliant, but solid, honest, and utterly without political ambition. He wants to serve well and retire to his vineyards. Such men make excellent administrators—they have nothing to prove and nothing to scheme for.\"\n\nShe looks up from the map. \"Any of these three would serve. Cardona is the most capable, Brancaccio the most Neapolitan, Ventimiglia the most... safe.\"\n\nThen her eyes sharpen as she absorbs the full scope of what Diego has written. \"You mean to appoint a governor for Castile as well? To place your own kingdom under the same structure as conquered Granada and distant Constantinople?\"\n\nShe glances at Álvaro, then back to you. \"That is... bold. Alfonso dreamed of such things but never dared attempt them. The Aragonese would have risen in revolt.\" A pause. \"But you are not Alfonso, and Castile is not Aragon. Perhaps it can be done. Who would you trust with such a position? It must be someone the grandees cannot dismiss, yet someone who will not use the office to build a rival power base.\"",

      "text": "1. Marino Brancaccio for Naples - the Neapolitan option, brave, poor, loyal\n2. Creating a governor structure for Castile, but Juan himself will hold the title, with an administrator running things day-to-day behind the scenes\n3. Juan is asking why his nobles would be upset about being part of a larger empire\n\nThis is a good moment for the NPCs to explain medieval political psychology - why Castilian nobles might resist being \"just another territory\" even under their own king. This touches on honor, precedence, identity, and the medieval understanding of kingdoms.\n\nLet me have Álvaro, María, and perhaps Isaac explain this from different angles. María especially has insight from watching Alfonso try (and fail) to manage multiple kingdoms.\n\nThe key points to make:\n1. Medieval kingdoms aren't administrative units - they're identities, with their own laws, customs, privileges\n2. Castilian nobles see themselves as the conquerors, the heart of the enterprise - not equal to conquered Granada or distant Constantinople\n3. The issue isn't the structure per se, but the symbolism - being \"governed\" implies subordination\n4. Juan's solution (being his own governor) is clever - it maintains the structure while preserving Castilian dignity\n5. But even so, there may be grumbling about the principle\n\nI should have the NPCs explain this clearly but not lecture. They're advising their king, helping him understand the political landscape. Álvaro especially should be frank but respectful.\n\nI'll also note María's approval of the Naples choice - Brancaccio is a solid pick that shows Juan values loyalty and competence over grand names.\n\n\"Brancaccio,\" María repeats, nodding slowly. \"A good choice. He held that fortress when braver men fled. And his poverty is an asset—he will work to keep your favor because he has nothing else.\" She pauses. \"I will write to him personally, if Your Majesty wishes. A letter from Alfonso's widow endorsing the appointment will carry weight with the older Neapolitan families.\"\n\nÁlvaro exchanges a glance with Diego at the Castilian arrangement. Some of the tension leaves his shoulders.\n\n\"Your Majesty as governor of Castile, with an administrator handling daily affairs. That... preserves the form while building the structure.\" He almost smiles. \"The grandees cannot complain that Castile is governed by an appointee when the appointee is their own king.\"\n\nBut at your question—why would they be upset—Álvaro's expression grows more serious. He moves to the window, gathering his thoughts before turning back.\n\n\"Your Majesty asks why Castilian nobles would resist being part of a greater empire. The answer is...\" He pauses, searching for the right words. \"They do not see it as being part of. They see it as being reduced to.\"\n\nMaría speaks up, her voice carrying the weight of decades watching kingdoms collide. \"When Alfonso ruled Aragon, Sicily, Sardinia, and finally Naples, the Aragonese never accepted that they were merely one kingdom among four. They were the kingdom—the heart, the origin, the source of legitimacy. The others were additions, acquisitions, provinces. Not equals.\"\n\n\"Castile conquered Granada,\" Álvaro continues. \"Castilian gold funds Constantinople. Castilian knights bled at Aversa to secure Naples for Alfonso—for your inheritance. In the minds of your nobles, Castile is not one territory among five. Castile is the sun around which the others orbit.\"\n\nDiego looks up from his notes. \"It is a matter of honra, Your Majesty. Honor. Precedence. The Mendozas, the Guzmáns, the Enríquez—these families trace their lineages back centuries. They fought the Moors when Granada was a threat, not a province. They see themselves as partners in a Castilian enterprise, not subjects of a multinational administration.\"\n\nIsaac offers a quieter perspective from the shadows. \"There is also fear, Your Majesty. Rational fear. If Castile is merely one province, then Castilian interests can be sacrificed for the good of the whole. Castilian gold sent east. Castilian soldiers dying for Constantinople. Castilian taxes funding Neapolitan roads. They will ask: what do we gain? And if the answer is 'glory for the empire,' they will ask whose empire it truly is.\"\n\nMaría nods. \"Alfonso faced this constantly. The Catalans resented funding Italian wars. The Sicilians resented Catalan administrators. Everyone resented everyone, because no one believed they were truly equal—and no one wanted to be equal to those they considered lesser.\"\n\nÁlvaro turns back to face you directly. \"Your Majesty's vision is sound. One crown, five territories, unified administration. It is how empires are built. But empires are also how kingdoms lose their identity. The Castilian grandees will accept the structure—especially with Your Majesty as governor—but they will watch carefully. The moment they perceive that Castilian interests are subordinated to imperial ones, they will resist.\"\n\nHe pauses, then adds more quietly: \"Your Majesty should also consider how this will be perceived abroad. The King of France styles himself king of one kingdom. The Holy Roman Emperor rules through a tangle of princes and electors, but he does not call Germany a 'territory.' If Your Majesty openly treats Castile as one province among five... other monarchs will take note. Some will admire the ambition. Others will see vulnerability—a king who has stretched himself across too many thrones.\"\n\nMaría offers a pragmatic suggestion. \"Perhaps the answer is not to announce the structure, but simply to build it. Governors in Granada, Aragon, Naples, Constantinople—this is sensible administration, and no one will question it. Your Majesty continuing to rule Castile directly, with capable administrators beneath you—this is simply good governance. The framework of equality exists, but the language of Castilian primacy remains. In time, as the system proves itself, the reality will shape perception more than any proclamation.\"\n\nShe meets your eyes. \"Alfonso tried to rule his kingdoms as equals and pleased none of them. You might accomplish more by building equality quietly than by declaring it loudly.\"",

      "text": "First, I need to understand the context:\n- Juan has established voluntary muster systems in multiple kingdoms\n- This is the first mustering (sometime in 1437)\n- The kingdoms involved are Castile, Granada, Aragon, Naples, and potentially Constantinople\n\nLet me check what I know about the muster systems:\n- From Chapter 2.42, Juan established a \"Voluntary Muster System for Aragon\" as Book XI of the new Fueros\n- The system was based on the \"Constitution of Contributions and Claims\" from Constantinople - titles and estates as rewards for service\n- This is voluntary, not obligatory\n\nI need to read the persuasion skill and chaos roll skill to understand how to build this table properly.\n\nLet me think about the factors:\n\nSUCCESS FACTORS:\n1. Juan's reputation as a successful military leader (Granada conquest, Naples victory, Constantinople defense)\n2. The voluntary nature makes it less threatening - men who come want to be there\n3. Potential rewards (titles, estates, honors) for service\n4. The crusade narrative - fighting for Christendom has appeal\n5. The Military Orders are already committed and serve as examples\n6. Juan has spent years building administrative infrastructure\n7. Economic conditions - if times are good, more men can afford to leave their lands\n8. This is the first call - novelty and enthusiasm may be high\n\nFAILURE FACTORS:\n1. First muster ever - systems are untested, communication may fail\n2. Different kingdoms have different traditions and expectations\n3. Some regions (Aragon particularly) have weak military obligations historically\n4. Naples is newly inherited - loyalty untested\n5. Distance from Toledo - farther regions may respond slower\n6. Noble resistance - some may discourage their vassals from participating\n7. Practical concerns - who works the fields if men go to muster?\n8. The Ottoman threat feels distant to Iberian peasants\n\n9. Language barriers across the empire\n10. Administrative coordination across five territories is unprecedented\n\nThe complexity of the mustering call reveals significant challenges. Communication, cultural differences, and untested administrative systems could dramatically impact participation. The voluntary nature means only motivated individuals will respond, potentially creating an unpredictable recruitment landscape.\n\nI'll need a nuanced approach that captures the potential variability of response across these diverse kingdoms. The d100 table must reflect both the enthusiasm for Juan's leadership and the logistical hurdles of this unprecedented mobilization.\n\nThe scale ranges from catastrophic failure to exceptional success, capturing the potential range of responses. Each tier represents not just numerical participation, but also the effectiveness of the empire's emerging administrative infrastructure. From near-total disinterest to overwhelming loyalty, the mustering call will be a critical test of imperial cohesion.\n\nThe key metrics will track both raw numbers and systemic performance, revealing how well these disparate territories can coordinate a unified military effort under a voluntary recruitment model.\n\nEstimating realistic participation requires careful analysis of each region's military capacity and potential willingness to respond. The theoretical pool suggests significant potential, with a first voluntary muster likely yielding between 3,000-8,000 men - a modest but meaningful initial test of the new imperial mobilization system.\n\nÁlvaro bows his head in acknowledgment of his new role. \"I will not fail Your Majesty's trust. Diego and I have worked together for years—we understand each other's methods.\"\n\nDiego is already making notes. \"Reporting standards—yes. Each territory must submit accounts in the same format, on the same schedule. Quarterly reports on revenues, expenses, and notable events. Annual comprehensive reviews. Latin as the administrative language makes sense—it is already the language of the Church, of law, of diplomacy. Any educated man across all five territories can read it.\"\n\n\"The guard rotation is wise,\" Isaac adds quietly. \"Governors who command their own loyal guards become... comfortable. Guards who answer to Toledo remain the crown's eyes as much as its swords.\"\n\nMaría watches all of this with something like wonder. \"You are building Rome,\" she murmurs. \"Alfonso dreamed. You build.\"\n\nÁlvaro moves to a cabinet and retrieves a leather folder. \"The first voluntary musters. We received reports throughout the autumn. I have not yet compiled the final figures, but...\"\n\nHe spreads several documents across the table—letters from crown marshalls, reports from Military Order commanders, tallies from regional administrators.\n\nDiego examines them with a practiced eye. \"The system is new. The call went out in spring, with assembly points designated for late summer. Some regions responded promptly. Others...\" He frowns at one letter. \"Communication was imperfect.\"\n\nVOLUNTARY MUSTER RESPONSE — FIRST CALL (1437)\n\nd100 Table\n\nThis roll determines how many men answered the first voluntary muster across all territories under Juan's authority. The muster system is unprecedented—a call for volunteers rather than obligatory feudal levies, with promises of titles, estates, and honors for those who serve.\n\nSuccess Factors:\n\nJuan's reputation as a victorious commander (Granada, Naples, Constantinople defense)\n\nConcrete incentives: the Constitution of Contributions and Claims promises land and titles for service\n\nMilitary Orders actively recruiting and leading by example\n\nStrong administrative infrastructure built over five years\n\nThe crusade narrative resonates with genuine religious feeling\n\nEconomic prosperity in Castile means more men can afford to leave their lands\n\nFirst call carries novelty and enthusiasm\n\nFailure Factors:\n\nFirst muster ever—systems untested, communication failures likely\n\nAragon historically has weak military obligations; voluntary participation is alien\n\nNaples newly inherited—barons may not encourage their men to answer a distant king's call\n\nDistance and language barriers across five territories\n\nSome Castilian nobles quietly discourage participation (resentment of \"imperial\" structure)\n\nPractical concerns: harvest season, who works the fields?\n\nThe Ottoman threat feels abstract to Iberian peasants who have never seen a Turk\n\nConstantinople is far away; dying there wins no glory visible at home\n\nBaseline Expectation:\nGiven the voluntary nature and first-time implementation, crown administrators estimated 4,000-6,000 men as a reasonable first response. Anything above 8,000 would exceed expectations; below 2,500 would indicate systemic failure.\n\nRoll\nResult\nOutcome\n1-5\nCatastrophic Failure\nFewer than 1,000 men appear across all territories. Administrative systems collapsed entirely in at least two regions. Letters never arrived, assembly points were unclear, and in Naples the call was actively suppressed by resentful barons. The muster is an embarrassment that enemies will mock.\n6-15\nSerious Failure\n1,000-2,000 men assemble, almost entirely from Castile. Aragon sent fewer than 200. Naples sent almost none—the barons claimed they \"never received clear instructions.\" Granada's Mudéjar population views the call with suspicion. The system needs fundamental revision.\n16-30\nDisappointing Response\n2,000-3,500 men answer. Castile provides the bulk (1,800-2,500), with modest contributions from the Military Orders. Aragon's response is thin (300-500); Naples provides a token showing (200-400). The system functions but inspires little enthusiasm.\n31-45\nModest Success\n3,500-5,000 men assemble. Castile performs adequately (2,500-3,000). Aragon surprises with 600-800 volunteers, drawn mostly by the promise of Eastern estates. Naples contributes 400-600, mostly younger sons seeking fortune. The framework proves viable but needs refinement.\n46-60\nSolid Foundation\n5,000-6,500 men respond. All territories participate meaningfully. Castile leads (3,000-3,500), Aragon provides 800-1,000, Naples 600-800, and even Granada contributes 400-500 converted settlers eager to prove loyalty. The system works as designed.\n61-75\nStrong Response\n6,500-8,500 men answer the call. Enthusiasm exceeds expectations in multiple regions. Aragonese merchants send younger sons hoping to establish Eastern trading connections. Neapolitan minor nobility sees opportunity. Military Orders report their best recruitment in years.\n76-85\nImpressive Turnout\n8,500-11,000 men assemble. Word of Constantinople's opportunities has spread—land, titles, adventure. Veterans of the Granada campaign seek new glory. Younger sons from across all territories see the muster as their path to independence. Some must be turned away for lack of transport.\n86-95\nExtraordinary Success\n11,000-14,000 men respond. The crusade narrative has captured imaginations across the empire. Nobles who expected resistance from their vassals find them eager to go. The Church preaches the cause from pulpits. Juan's reputation as a leader who rewards loyalty proves decisive.\n96-100\nTransformative Response\n14,000+ men answer—far beyond any projection. The voluntary muster has become a movement. Men bring their own horses, their own weapons, their own provisions. Fathers send sons with blessings rather than reluctance. The empire has found its unifying purpose. Transportation becomes the limiting factor, not recruitment.\n\nDiego looks up from the compiled reports. \"The numbers are still being finalized, but we have enough to know the general shape of the response.\"\n\nÁlvaro gestures to the documents. \"Your Majesty should roll to see what the first call produced. This will tell us whether the system we have built can bear the weight of an empire—or whether we must rebuild from the foundations.\"",

Prince Henry reportedly complained about losing good sailors.\nTOTAL\n12,437\n\nMaría has risen from her seat, moving to examine the documents herself. \"This is not possible,\" she murmurs, but the numbers stare back at her, inked in Diego's precise hand. \"Alfonso spent years negotiating with the Aragonese Cortes to raise six thousand men for Naples. Years of promises, threats, bribes. You sent a letter and received nearly two thousand volunteers?\"\n\n\"The Constitution of Contributions and Claims,\" Isaac says from the shadows, his voice thoughtful. \"Land and titles for service. Not empty promises—they have seen you keep your word. The settlers in Constantinople write home. Their families tell neighbors. The man who goes east comes back with an estate, or his widow receives one in his name.\"\n\nÁlvaro nods slowly. \"And the Church. The crusade preaching has been... effective. Bishops across all territories read Your Majesty's letters from their pulpits. The fall of Constantinople is no longer an abstraction—it is a Christian duty to prevent.\"\n\nCaptain Fernán speaks up, his military mind already working through implications. \"Twelve thousand men. Our current transport capacity is perhaps four thousand per voyage, if we press every available ship. Three sailings to move them all—spring, summer, autumn. Or we stage them, sending the best-trained first while others continue drilling.\"\n\n\"The question,\" Diego says carefully, \"is whether we want to send twelve thousand men east. That is an army. Not a garrison reinforcement—an army capable of offensive operations.\"\n\nThe room falls silent. The Tenedos truce holds for seven more years. Twelve thousand additional men in Constantinople would be the largest Latin force in the East since the Fourth Crusade.\n\nÁlvaro turns to you, and for the first time in years, you see something like uncertainty in his eyes—not doubt in your judgment, but awe at the forces now at your command.\n\n\"Your Majesty has built something that has not existed since Charlemagne. Five territories answering one call, one purpose, one crown. The grandees may grumble about Castilian primacy, but...\" He gestures at the tallies. \"Twelve thousand men did not come because they were ordered. They came because they believe.\"\n\nMaría's voice is soft. \"Alfonso would have wept to see this. He dreamed of empire his entire life and never held more than Naples could give him. You have surpassed him in five years.\"\n\nDiego, ever practical, taps his quill against the table. \"What are Your Majesty's orders? Do we transport all twelve thousand east? Hold some in reserve? Continue the muster for a second year while we build transport capacity?\"",

Granada and Almería have the harshest terrain—mountain warfare training.\"\n\nCaptain Fernán leans forward. \"If Your Majesty wishes to test march discipline, I would suggest varying the orders. Some points receive orders for a forced march—thirty miles in a day. Others receive orders for a difficult river crossing, or a night march, or a mock siege assembly. We learn which commanders can execute complex orders, and which need further training.\"\n\nMaría speaks up thoughtfully. \"And the celebration at the end—that is wise. Men remember how they are treated. A muster that ends with full bellies and flowing wine becomes something they speak of proudly. Their sons will want to attend the next one.\"\n\nDiego makes additional notes. \"I will need to coordinate with regional administrators for supply caches at the endpoint locations. Grain, wine, meat—enough for several thousand men at each point. The expense will be significant, but...\"\n\n\"But it is an investment,\" Álvaro finishes. \"An army that trusts it will be fed is an army that will march.\"\n\nHe turns to you. \"Your Majesty mentioned commanding the Castile muster personally, with some of the children. Which mustering point? Toledo is the obvious choice—the men would see their king and the royal heirs in the capital. But Burgos or Seville would send a different message: that the king rides to meet his soldiers where they gather, not merely summons them to his seat.\"\n\nDiego adds quietly, \"And which children, Your Majesty? The Prince of Asturias is four years old—old enough to sit a horse with assistance. Princess Catalina is six, and already rides well. The younger ones...\"\n\nHe trails off, leaving the question open.",

They will then go on a 3-5 days march to a location that they will learn only after they have assembled. The officers and commanders at location have command and are responsible for the march. We let musters combine at the same destinations where possible. Once there they are to assemble immediately after arriving into battle formations where we will then perform some field drills according to orders they recieve at the end location. This may involve firing a field cannon a few times for example, have infantry form up and establish a defensive formation. Archer or crossbow formations to advance and shoot at an area marked with targets, and cavalry performing an imaginative flanking move. After the field manouvers have concluded, the muster ends and the men can enjoy the food and drink at the feast. The crown treasury provides the feast and buys local foods where the muster ends. We pay good prices, making the muster also a stimulus to the local economy a bit. And for compensation for any discomfort (or damage) the men and the muster cause when they are doing the muster.",

After drills, feast provided by crown treasury\n9. Buy local foods at good prices (economic stimulus)\n10. Compensation for any damage/discomfort caused\n\nThis is a sophisticated military training system. I need to help Diego draft this into a coherent plan with specific destinations, combined musters, etc.\n\nLet me think about which musters could logically combine:\n\nCASTILE:\n- Toledo + Valladolid could combine somewhere in between (Arévalo? Ávila?)\n- Burgos + Salamanca could combine (maybe Zamora? Medina del Campo?)\n- Seville + Cartagena... these are far apart. Maybe they stay separate or meet somewhere in La Mancha?\n\nGRANADA:\n- Granada + Málaga + Almería could potentially all combine at one location, or two combine\n\nARAGON:\n- Zaragoza + Tarragona could combine\n- Barcelona + Valencia could combine (maybe at Tortosa?)\n\nNAPLES:\n- Naples + Bari could combine in southern Italy\n- Palermo stays separate (it's on Sicily)\n\nCONSTANTINOPLE:\n- Constantinople stays as is (garrison training)\n\nLet me draft destinations that make military sense and test the march capability:\n\nI should have Diego and Álvaro work through this systematically, creating a document that shows:\n\nI'll map out a comprehensive training strategy focusing on strategic assembly points, terrain considerations, and coordinated military drills. Each region will have carefully selected meeting locations that minimize travel challenges while maximizing training effectiveness. The goal is to test troop mobility, coordination, and readiness across diverse geographical regions.\n\nKey considerations include selecting central meeting points that reduce individual troop travel distances, account for terrain difficulties, and provide optimal training environments. We'll prioritize locations that allow combined mustering while maintaining tactical flexibility and minimizing logistical strain.\n\nÁlvaro listens intently, and a slow smile spreads across his weathered face—the expression of a man who has spent decades managing armies and finally sees someone who understands what he has always known.\n\n\"This is how you build an army without anyone realizing you have built one,\" he says. \"Each man thinks he is attending a local muster. But when twelve thousand men across five territories receive the same orders, execute the same movements, respond to the same command structure—\" He spreads his hands. \"You have forged a weapon.\"\n\nDiego is writing furiously, capturing the details. \"Secret destinations revealed only after assembly. This tests whether the officers can actually lead, not merely gather men in a field. And combining musters at endpoints—the men from Toledo meet the men from Valladolid, learn each other's faces, realize they are part of something larger than their own region.\"\n\nCaptain Fernán's eyes are bright with professional appreciation. \"The field drills at the end—brilliant. Every commander claims his men can form a defensive square or execute a flanking maneuver. Now we will see. And the men who fire those cannons, who loose those crossbow volleys—they go home having done something real, not merely stood in a field to be counted.\"\n\nMaría nods thoughtfully. \"And paying good prices for local food, compensating for damages... the muster becomes a blessing to the towns where it ends, not a curse. Farmers and merchants will want the muster to come to their region next year.\"\n\nDiego looks up from his notes. \"Let me draft the destinations and combinations. We should consider terrain, distance, and strategic logic.\"\n\nHe pulls out a larger map and begins marking locations.\n\nMUSTER EXERCISE PLAN — SUMMER 1438\n\nCASTILE\n\nStarting Point\nDestination\nMarch Distance\nTerrain Challenge\nCombines With\nToledo\nArévalo\n~75 miles\nOpen meseta, summer heat, river crossing at Adaja\nValladolid\nValladolid\nArévalo\n~45 miles\nRolling plains, well-roaded\nToledo\nBurgos\nPalencia\n~50 miles\nNorthern plateau, cooler climate\nSalamanca\nSalamanca\nPalencia\n~95 miles\nCrosses Duero River, longer march tests endurance\nBurgos\nSeville\nCórdoba\n~80 miles\nGuadalquivir valley, extreme heat, river road\nCartagena (partial)\nCartagena\nCórdoba\n~250 miles\nLongest march.

Coastal fortress. Tests rapid deployment along threatened frontier. Greek and Latin units drill together.\n\nDiego finishes the chart and looks up. \"Fifteen combined exercises across four territories. The longest march is Cartagena to Córdoba—we may wish to transport the Murcian contingent by sea to Málaga and have them march overland from there, reducing the journey to something more reasonable.\"\n\nÁlvaro studies the map. \"The combinations are shrewd. Toledo meets Valladolid. Barcelona meets Valencia. Naples meets Bari. Men from different regions, different traditions, learning to stand in formation together.\"\n\nCaptain Fernán traces the routes with his finger. \"The field drills at each endpoint—shall I draft standardized orders? Each destination receives the same sequence: infantry defensive square, crossbow volley at targets, cavalry flanking demonstration, cannon firing if artillery is present. The commanders who execute well are noted. Those who fumble...\"\n\n\"Are given additional training before next year,\" Álvaro finishes. \"Not punishment—correction. We are building, not breaking.\"\n\nDiego tallies the logistics. \"Fifteen feasts, each feeding between five hundred and four thousand men. Local purchasing at fair prices. Damage compensation funds held in reserve. I estimate... forty to fifty thousand florins for the entire exercise, depending on food costs and how much damage enthusiastic cavalry causes to farmers' fences.\"\n\nHe pauses, quill hovering. \"Your Majesty mentioned commanding the Castile muster personally with some of the children. Will you be at Arévalo, where Toledo and Valladolid combine? That would place you with the largest Castilian assembly—nearly four thousand men seeing their king and heirs.\"",

A significant sum, but consider what it purchases: a trained imperial army that has marched together, drilled together, celebrated together. Men from Toledo who know men from Valencia, from Naples, from Constantinople.\"\n\nÁlvaro studies the document, his expression thoughtful. \"The rotation of officers between territories—that is the key. A crown marshall who serves three years in Aragon, then three in Naples, then three in Granada... he becomes an imperial official, not a regional one. His loyalty is to the system, not to any single kingdom.\"\n\nMaría looks up from where she has been reading over Diego's shoulder. \"You have created something that did not exist before. Not five kingdoms ruled by one king—that is merely personal union, and it dissolves when the king dies. This...\" She gestures at the document. \"This is infrastructure. It will outlast any single reign.\"\n\nCaptain Fernán adds quietly, \"And the field exercises will reveal which commanders can execute orders and which cannot. After this summer, we will know exactly what we have—and what we lack.\"\n\nIsaac, still in the shadows, offers the final word. \"Twelve thousand men answered a call last year. This year, they will march, drill, and feast together. Next year, they will answer again—and bring their brothers. Your Majesty is not building an army. You are building a tradition.\"\n\nThe winter sun has moved across the solar's windows. The fleet assessment lies forgotten beneath the new documents—the muster plan, the administrator appointments, the framework of empire taking shape on parchment before it takes shape in stone and steel.\n\nÁlvaro straightens. \"Shall I dispatch the letters today, Your Majesty? To Don García confirming Granada, to Santcliment sounding out Aragon, to Brancaccio offering Naples, to Master Sotomayor regarding Constantinople?\" He pauses. \"And to Sir Thomas Beaumont regarding the academy officers?\"\n\nFile: /home/claude/Imperial_Muster_Plan_1438.docx",

Multiple critical letters need dispatching to strategic regional contacts, including potential appointments in Granada, Aragon, and Naples. The pending Ottoman Truce and ongoing Constantinople infrastructure project underscore the complexity of current geopolitical negotiations. Personal developments, like Lucia's pregnancy, interweave with these broader administrative priorities.\n\nVolunteer recruitment breakdown reveals significant regional contributions: Castile leads with 6,200 volunteers, followed by Military Orders, Aragon, and Naples, reflecting a robust and diverse military mobilization strategy.\n\nThe 1438 Imperial Muster Plan encompasses 18 strategic mustering points across four territories, with a total projected cost of 42,650 florins.
