      "text": "I see the database is quite long and truncated. Let me also read the most recent chapter summary - Chapter 2.42. Let me search for that file.\n\n1. **Date/Time**: November 1437, evening before the second Cortes session\n2. **Location**: Aljafería Palace, Zaragoza\n3. **Present**: Juan, María (nearby), Diego de Daza, Isaac de Baeza\n4. **Situation**: Agreements secured with all three estates; new Books drafted for the Fueros; coronation oath to occur at next Cortes session\n\nThis is an exciting moment - Juan has just completed negotiations with all three estates of Aragon. The coronation oath will happen at the next Cortes session. He's exhausted but successful.\n\nThe chapter ended with Juan having secured agreements and the new Books drafted. Now I need to pick up exactly where things left off - the evening before the second Cortes session where he'll take his coronation oath.\n\nLet me write the chapter introduction.\n\nChapter 2.43\n\nNovember 1437, Evening\n\nYou stand at the window of your private chambers in the Aljafería Palace, looking out over the darkened gardens below. The cool November air carries the faint scent of the Ebro—river-mud and autumn leaves. Behind you, on the great oak table, lie the drafts of three new Books for the Fueros de Aragón: the registry of privileges, the sacred tithe, the voluntary muster. Three days of negotiations distilled into ink and parchment.\n\nDiego de Daza sits in the corner, still reviewing the financial provisions with meticulous care. Isaac de Baeza departed an hour ago to his own quarters, his work done for now. Somewhere in the women's wing, Queen María—Alfonso's widow, soon to be aunt to your realm—rests after helping you navigate the treacherous waters of Aragonese politics.\n\nTomorrow the Cortes reconvenes. Tomorrow you will stand before the assembled estates—clergy, nobility, cities—and swear the coronation oath. The words have been written for centuries: \"We who are as good as you swear to you who are no better than we, to accept you as our King and Sovereign Lord, provided you observe all our liberties and laws; but if not, not.\" A contract, not a coronation. A negotiation made permanent.\n\nThe Archbishop has agreed to the tercias. The nobles have accepted the registry—with conditions, but accepted nonetheless. Even the merchants, after your stumble and recovery, have expressed willingness to listen further. By the standards of Aragonese succession, this is triumph. Yet in Toledo, Lucia grows heavier with your third child, and you will not be there when the moment comes.\n\nDiego looks up from his documents. \"The provisions are sound, Your Majesty. The thirty-day grace period for oath violation accusations—that was a wise addition. It protects both sides.\"",

      "text": "**Success Factors:**\n1. All three estates have agreed to the new Books (clergy roll 88, nobility roll 62)\n2. Juan has studied the Fueros extensively and understands what he's swearing\n3. María has coached him on Aragonese customs\n4. The Archbishop is supportive (will preside)\n5. Don Lope XiménezdeUrrea gave his endorsement - a major elder statesman\n6. Juan apologized and recovered from the merchant disaster, showing humility\n7. No one is actively opposing - even Don Juan de Híjar grudgingly accepted\n\n**Potential Complications:**\n1. The initial succession roll was 29 - \"hard bargaining; Cortes will extract concessions\" - this sets a baseline of difficulty\n2. Don Juan de Híjar is \"hostile but compliant\" - could cause problems\n3. Merchants are \"wary but willing\" - not enthusiastic\n4. The oath itself is famously conditional - the ceremony could involve last-minute demands\n5. Juan is a Castilian king taking an Aragonese crown - there could be cultural friction\n6. Alfonso's Italian wars left the realm in debt - there may be unresolved grievances\n7. The Urgell line (Don Felipe de Castro) has dormant claims\n\n**Nature of the Roll:**\nThis is more of a chaos roll than a persuasion roll - Juan isn't trying to convince anyone of anything new. He's executing on agreements already made. But the ceremony itself could go smoothly or have complications.\n\nGiven that the groundwork is solid but the initial succession roll was 29, I'd say:\n- Very low rolls (1-15): Something goes wrong - a dramatic objection, an accident, a bad omen\n- Low rolls (16-35): Complications arise - additional demands, tense moments, grudging acceptance\n\n- Middle rolls (36-65): Standard ceremony with some friction but successful\n- High rolls (66-85): Smooth ceremony with genuine enthusiasm\n- Very high rolls (86-100): Triumphant coronation with unexpected positive developments\n\nI'll create a detailed breakdown of potential outcomes for each roll range. The ceremony's success depends on navigating complex political dynamics and cultural sensitivities. Each roll represents the delicate balance of power, tradition, and personal relationships at this pivotal moment.\n\nThe coronation oath is the culmination of your negotiations—but in Aragón, the ceremony itself can become a final arena for demands, objections, or demonstrations. The estates have agreed, but the public ritual carries its own weight.\n\nCoronation Oath Chaos Roll\n\nContext: Juan has secured agreement from all three estates for the new Fueros additions. The Archbishop is supportive, Don Lope has endorsed him, and even hostile nobles have accepted consensus. However, the initial succession roll (29) indicated hard bargaining, and Don Juan de Híjar remains \"hostile but compliant.\" The ceremony is public—witnesses from across the realm will watch.\n\nFactors Favoring Success\n\nAll three estates negotiated and agreed to terms\n\nArchbishop Dalmau will preside as a supporter\n\nDon Lope's endorsement carries enormous weight\n\nJuan studied the Fueros and understands what he swears\n\nMaría coached him on Aragonese customs and expectations\n\nRecovery from merchant disaster showed humility rare in kings\n\nFactors Creating Risk\n\nInitial succession roll (29) set tone of extraction and suspicion\n\nDon Juan de Híjar actively hostile, watching for missteps\n\nMerchants remain wary, not enthusiastic\n\nJuan is a Castilian king—cultural suspicion lingers\n\nAlfonso's debts and broken promises still remembered\n\nPublic ceremony invites grandstanding or objections\n\nD100 Table: The Coronation Oath\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-5\nDisaster at the Altar. A dramatic interruption—perhaps Don Juan de Híjar or another noble rises with a formal legal objection, invoking some obscure fuero or dormant claim. The ceremony halts. The Justicia must adjudicate before the oath can proceed. Days of delay; your authority questioned before you even wear the crown.\n6-15\nIll Omen. The ceremony proceeds, but something mars it publicly—a candle gutters out at the wrong moment, a bird enters the cathedral, you stumble on the oath's archaic phrasing. Superstitious murmurs spread. You are crowned, but whispers of bad fortune follow. Aragonese will watch your reign with heightened scrutiny for signs of divine disfavor.\n16-25\nLast-Minute Extraction. As you approach the oath, one estate's representative rises to \"clarify\" a point—essentially demanding an additional concession in public, where refusal would halt the ceremony. You must agree to something minor but irritating, or risk a scene. The oath proceeds, but you've been reminded who holds leverage here.\n26-40\nGrudging Formality. The ceremony proceeds correctly but coldly. The nobles speak their parts without warmth. The merchants observe in stony silence. You are crowned King of Aragón, but the room feels like a contract signing, not a coronation. Functional, but no one pretends to celebrate.\n41-55\nProper Ceremony. The oath proceeds as tradition demands. Archbishop Dalmau presides with dignity. Don Lope speaks for the nobility with measured respect. The merchants attend without objection. You swear the fueros, receive the crown, and hear the formal acclamation. Not triumphant, but solid—exactly what Aragonese succession should look like.\n56-70\nRespectful Reception. The ceremony acquires genuine warmth. Don Lope's endorsement proves influential—other nobles follow his lead in treating you with courtesy rather than mere compliance. The Archbishop's homily praises your study of the fueros. Even Don Juan de Híjar maintains dignified silence. You leave crowned and cautiously welcomed.\n71-85\nEnthusiastic Acclamation. Something shifts in the room—perhaps your evident respect for Aragonese traditions, perhaps the promise of the crusade, perhaps simply relief after Alfonso's neglect. The acclamation rings with genuine feeling. Merchants who were wary now speak of opportunities. You are crowned not just legally, but with the beginnings of real loyalty.\n86-95\nA King Who Listens. Your conduct during negotiations has become known throughout the assembly. The story of your apology to the merchants, your acceptance of Don Lope's conditions, your refusal to touch the Justicia—these have spread. The Aragonese see something rare: a king who treats the fueros as sacred rather than obstacles. The coronation becomes a celebration. Cheers echo in the cathedral.\n96-100\n\"Un Rey d'Aragón.\" In the moment after you speak the oath, Don Lope Ximénez de Urrea—sixty years of opposing kings—rises unbidden and declares publicly that in all his years, he has never seen a king approach the crown with such genuine respect for Aragonese liberty. His words transform the ceremony. Other nobles rise to echo him. The merchants, moved by the moment, pledge immediate discussion of partnership terms. You are crowned not as a Castilian interloper, but as a true King of Aragón. Stories of this day will be told for generations.\n\nWhen you're ready, roll the d100.",

Include Don Lope's endorsement as a key turning point\n4. End with the coronation complete but stop before deciding what Juan does next\n\nI should NOT:\n- Have Juan speak or act\n- Decide what Juan does after the ceremony\n- Rush through this important moment\n\nThe ceremony would take place in La Seo (the Cathedral of San Salvador) in Zaragoza, which was the traditional coronation site for Aragonese kings. I should include appropriate Latin phrases and medieval Aragonese customs.\n\nThe morning of your coronation dawns gray and cold, a thin mist rising from the Ebro to shroud the towers of La Seo. The Cathedral of San Salvador has witnessed the making of Aragonese kings for centuries—its stones remember oaths kept and broken, dynasties risen and fallen. Today it will witness you.\n\nYou dress in the robes prepared for this moment: cloth-of-gold over crimson, the arms of Castile quartered now with those of Aragón. No crown yet—that comes after the oath, if the oath is accepted. In Aragón, a king earns his crown by contract.\n\nThe procession moves through streets lined with watching crowds. Not the wild enthusiasm of Granada's liberation, but something more measured—Aragonese reserve, judgment suspended until the oath is sworn. They have seen kings before. They will see if this one proves different.\n\nInside La Seo, the three estates have assembled in their ancient order. The clergy fill the choir stalls, Archbishop Dalmau de Mur resplendent in his vestments at the high altar. The nobility occupies the right side of the nave—you see Don Lope Ximénez de Urrea in the place of honor, his lined face unreadable, and beside him Don Juan de Híjar with arms crossed and jaw set. Don Bernat de Centelles catches your eye and nods almost imperceptibly. The merchants and city representatives fill the left side, Berenguer de Montcada at their head, his expression careful.\n\nThe Justicia of Aragón, Don Martín Díez de Aux, stands between the estates and the altar. It is he, not the Archbishop, who will administer the oath. In Aragón, the law stands above even holy unction.\n\nYou walk the long nave alone. No attendants, no guards—another Aragonese tradition. A king comes to his people as a man seeking a contract, not a conqueror demanding submission.\n\nAt the altar, you kneel.\n\nThe Justicia's voice rings through the cathedral, speaking the ancient formula in the old Aragonese tongue: \"Nos, que valemos tanto como vos, os hacemos nuestro Rey y Señor, con tal que guardéis nuestros fueros y libertades; y si no, no.\"\n\nWe, who are as good as you, make you our King and Sovereign Lord, provided you observe our fueros and liberties; and if not, not.\n\nThe cathedral falls utterly silent. Every eye fixes upon you.\n\nYou speak the response—the words you studied with María, the oath you have prepared yourself to keep: You swear to maintain the fueros entire and inviolate. You swear to preserve the liberties of the estates. You swear to submit to the Justicia's judgment in matters of law. You swear, and your voice carries clear and steady through the ancient stones.\n\nThe Justicia nods. \"The oath is given. Let the estates respond.\"\n\nArchbishop Dalmau speaks first, as tradition demands. But his words go beyond the formal acceptance. He speaks of a king who came to Aragón not with demands but with questions. Who read the fueros before swearing them. Who proposed strengthening Aragonese liberties rather than circumventing them. \"The Church accepts this oath,\" he concludes, \"and rejoices in it.\"\n\nThen Don Lope Ximénez de Urrea rises from his seat.\n\nThe old man moves slowly, arthritis evident in every step, but the cathedral hangs on his motion. Sixty years he has negotiated with Aragonese kings. Four monarchs have learned to respect—or fear—his stubborn defense of noble privilege. When Don Lope speaks, Aragón listens.\n\n\"I have seen kings swear this oath,\" he says, his voice carrying despite its age. \"I have seen them swear it with fingers crossed behind their backs. I have seen them swear it while their lawyers sought loopholes. I have seen them swear it and break it within the year.\"\n\nHe pauses, and in that pause you feel the weight of Aragonese history—centuries of struggle between crown and constitution, between royal ambition and noble liberty.\n\n\"This king,\" Don Lope continues, \"came to us differently. When we demanded conditions, he did not argue—he improved upon them. When we asked for guarantees, he offered stronger ones than we had thought to request. When we tested him with the Justicia, he declared that reforms to that office must come from us, not from him.\"\n\nThe old man's eyes find yours across the cathedral.\n\n\"I have negotiated with four kings of Aragón. This is the first I have believed.\"\n\nHe turns to the assembled nobility. \"The nobility accepts this oath. Not merely in form, but in substance. Not merely today, but in hope of what may follow.\"\n\nA murmur runs through the noble ranks—surprise, consideration, and then, from Don Bernat and others, voices rising in agreement. Even Don Juan de Híjar, whatever his private feelings, does not dissent aloud. Don Lope has spoken. To contradict him publicly would be to break noble unity.\n\nBerenguer de Montcada rises for the merchants. His words are more cautious—the wound of your earlier misstep has not fully healed—but he acknowledges what has been seen. \"The cities have watched these negotiations,\" he says. \"We have seen a king who, when he erred, admitted error. Who, when we refused, did not threaten. Who spoke of partnership rather than subjection.\" He pauses. \"The cities accept this oath, and await the partnership we have been promised.\"\n\nArchbishop Dalmau lifts the crown of Aragón—simpler than Castile's, iron rather than gold, a reminder of the kingdom's martial origins—and speaks the blessing. Holy oil touches your forehead. The weight of iron settles onto your brow.\n\n\"Vivat Rex! Vivat Rex! Vivat Rex!\"\n\nThe acclamation erupts not in the cold formality you expected, but with genuine voice. Cheers echo from the stone vaults. You see men who entered this cathedral suspicious now shouting with something approaching enthusiasm. Not the wild love of subjects for a conqueror, but something perhaps more valuable—the respect of free men for a king who has shown he understands what freedom means to them.\n\nAs you rise, crowned, you catch fragments of conversation from the noble ranks: \"—studied the fueros before he swore—\" and \"—apologized to the merchants, can you imagine Alfonso—\" and \"—refused to touch the Justicia, said it must come from us—\"\n\nThe stories have spread. Your conduct in the negotiations has become known. And in Aragón, where kings are judged not by their power but by their respect for limits, these stories matter more than any military victory.\n\nOutside La Seo, the crowds have heard the acclamation. As you emerge into the gray November light, King of Aragón as well as Castile, the cheering spreads through the streets of Zaragoza. Church bells begin to ring—first La Seo, then San Pablo, then others across the city.\n\nDon Lope appears at your side, moving with difficulty but determined. \"You have made a good beginning, Your Majesty,\" he says quietly, beneath the noise. \"Now you must keep what you have sworn. We will be watching.\"\n\nIt is, you realize, the highest compliment an Aragonese noble can pay.\n\nQueen María waits at the cathedral steps, her face showing something you haven't seen there before—genuine hope. She has watched one husband neglect this kingdom for Italian dreams. Perhaps she dares to believe this one will prove different.\n\nYou are Juan II, by the grace of God King of Castile, León, and now Aragón. Three crowns. Three oaths. Three sets of expectations.\n\nIn Toledo, Lucia carries your third child. In Naples, barons await your pleasure. In Constantinople, allies prepare for a war that will shake the world.\n\nBut here, now, in Zaragoza, the bells ring for a king who listened.",

You must cross the Pyrenees into the County of Barcelona, then take ship from the Catalan coast across the western Mediterranean—through waters where Genoese, Venetian, and occasional Barbary vessels complicate passage.\n\nHowever, the earlier succession roll for Naples was extraordinary: 99 - Triumphant inheritance. The Neapolitan barons have already declared for you as \"il Liberatore\" before you even pressed your claim. René of Anjou's partisans have found themselves isolated. The kingdom awaits its new master with something approaching eagerness.\n\nStill, the journey itself carries risks—winter seas, potential Angevin interference, the logistics of moving your company across hundreds of leagues.\n\nJourney to Naples - Chaos Roll\n\nContext: Late November/December 1437. Winter Mediterranean crossing. Juan travels with his personal company (size to be confirmed). Naples has already declared for him, but he must physically arrive to claim the crown.\n\nFactors Favoring Success\n\nNeapolitan barons already declared for Juan (Roll 99)\n\nAragonese naval resources now available\n\nCatalan merchants have interest in smooth succession\n\nRené of Anjou's position already collapsing\n\nFactors Creating Risk\n\nWinter Mediterranean crossing\n\nAngevin loyalists may attempt interference\n\nLong distance (Barcelona to Naples ~700 nautical miles)\n\nJuan absent from both Castile and newly-claimed Aragón\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-10\nStorm and Disaster. Winter seas prove treacherous. Significant losses—ships, men, or critical delay that allows Angevin forces to regroup.\n11-25\nDifficult Passage. Storms, delays, or minor Angevin naval harassment. You arrive, but late and battered. Some momentum lost.\n26-40\nSlow but Steady. Weather forces cautious sailing. Weeks of delay. Naples remains loyal, but the prolonged absence from Iberia creates administrative strain.\n41-60\nUneventful Crossing. Professional seamanship carries you through winter waters. You arrive as expected, ready to claim your crown.\n61-75\nSwift Passage. Favorable winds speed your crossing. You arrive ahead of schedule, catching any remaining Angevin sympathizers unprepared.\n76-90\nTriumphant Arrival. The crossing becomes a procession—Catalan and Neapolitan ships join your fleet as escort. You arrive in strength, your authority visible to all.\n91-100\nThe Liberator Comes. Everything aligns. Neapolitan galleys meet you at sea with news that René's last supporters have fled. Naples prepares a reception fit for a savior. Your arrival becomes legend.\n\nBefore you roll—how large is your company for this journey? Did you bring the full complement from Castile, or a smaller force given that Naples has already declared?",

The Catalan shipwrights provide three war galleys and four transport vessels, their masters eager to cement favor with the new king who speaks of Mediterranean partnerships rather than Castilian dominance.\n\nThe winter crossing should be treacherous. It is not.\n\nThe winds blow from the northwest—unseasonable, the sailors murmur, providential. What should take three weeks takes twelve days. The seas that swallowed fleets in Decembers past lie calm as a millpond. Old sailors make the sign of the cross and speak of Saint Elmo's favor.\n\nOn the seventh day, off the coast of Sardinia, sails appear on the horizon.\n\nYour captains call for battle stations—Angevin raiders, perhaps, or Genoese opportunists. But as the vessels draw closer, the lookouts call down in confusion: \"Aragonese colors! No—Neapolitan! They're flying the arms of Naples!\"\n\nA delegation. Six Neapolitan war galleys, their oars flashing in winter sunlight, have sailed out to meet you. At their head flies the banner of the Caracciolo—one of Naples' most powerful baronial families.\n\nThe lead galley draws alongside. A man in his fifties, armor polished to mirror brightness, calls across the water in accented but serviceable Castilian:\n\n\"Your Majesty! I am Sergianni Caracciolo, Duke of Venosa, come to escort il Liberatore to his kingdom! René of Anjou fled Naples three days past—his supporters scatter like rats from a sinking ship. The barons have prepared a reception such as Naples has not seen since the days of the first Alfonso!\"\n\nThe Neapolitan galleys fall into formation around your small fleet—an honor guard that swells your seven vessels to thirteen. As you round the cape and the Bay of Naples opens before you, more ships emerge from the harbor. Twenty. Thirty. The entire Neapolitan fleet, such as it remains after Alfonso's wars, has sortied to welcome its new king.\n\nAnd beyond the ships—Naples itself.\n\nThe city rises from the bay in tiers of white and gold, dominated by the massive bulk of Castel Nuovo, the Angevin fortress that now awaits an Aragonese—a Castilian—a Trastámara master. Smoke rises from a thousand chimneys. Church bells ring across the water, their sound carrying for miles in the still winter air.\n\nAs your galley enters the harbor, you see the quays black with people. Not the cautious reserve of Zaragoza, not the measured judgment of Aragón. This is something else entirely—desperate hope given form. Naples has suffered under Angevin misrule, under baronial warfare, under the chaos of disputed succession. The lords who declared for you did so not from love, but from calculation: you are the strong hand they need, the king who conquered Granada, the ruler who might finally bring order to their fractured realm.\n\nBut the common people of Naples have heard other stories. Stories of a king who treats his subjects justly. Who rebuilt a conquered kingdom rather than plundering it. Who kept faith with former enemies. Whether these stories are fully accurate matters less than what they represent: hope.\n\n\"Il Liberatore! Il Liberatore!\"\n\nThe cry begins at the docks and spreads through the city like fire. By the time your galley touches the quay, all of Naples seems to be shouting it.\n\nA delegation of barons waits on the dock—the great names of the kingdom assembled in unprecedented unity. You recognize some from reports: Giovanni Antonio Orsini, Prince of Taranto, the most powerful lord in the realm. Raimondo del Balzo, Duke of Andria. Francesco Sforza's representative, watching with calculating eyes on behalf of Milan's interests. And Sergianni Caracciolo himself, having raced ahead to take his place among the welcoming party.\n\nThe Prince of Taranto steps forward as you descend the gangplank. He is a large man, running to fat, but his eyes are sharp and his bow is deep.\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" he says, in Italian that your years of study allow you to follow. \"Naples has waited long for a king worthy of her. René of Anjou proved... inadequate. His supporters have fled or submitted. The throne of Sicily citra Pharum stands empty, awaiting its rightful lord.\"\n\nHe gestures toward Castel Nuovo, looming above the harbor.\n\n\"The castle is prepared. The coronation regalia has been retrieved from where René's people hid it. The Archbishop of Naples awaits to perform the unction.\" A pause, weighted with meaning. \"All that remains is for Your Majesty to state the terms upon which you will rule us.\"\n\nThe other barons watch. This is the moment—not the ceremony, not the crown, but this. Naples has declared for you, yes. But Naples is a kingdom of powerful lords who have made and unmade kings for generations. They have chosen you because they believe you will serve their interests.\n\nThe Prince of Taranto's eyes hold a question: What kind of king will you be?",

      "text": "I made a significant error by suggesting René just fled and that there were Angevin supporters still around. In reality, Alfonso had consolidated his rule over Naples for several years before his death. René would be in France, nursing old grievances perhaps, but not a present threat in Naples itself.\n\nLet me also correct the framing - this isn't Juan liberating Naples from the Angevins, it's Juan inheriting Naples from his cousin Alfonso who already did the liberating/conquering. The \"il Liberatore\" title is strange in this context - maybe they're calling him that because of his reputation from Granada and Constantinople? Or maybe I should reconsider what the roll result means.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. The 99 roll said \"Neapolitan lords declare for Juan as 'il Liberatore' before he presses claim\" - this could mean they're excited about him for his reputation, not because he's liberating them from anyone current. They might be hoping he'll be a better, more present king than Alfonso who was always focused on Italian politics and wars.\n\nNow the user is asking Diego de Daza about how the crown of Naples works - what rights does the crown have there? This is a legitimate question about Neapolitan constitutional/administrative structure.\n \nNaples operated under a unique feudal system where papal authority and baronial power significantly constrained the monarch. The king nominally held the kingdom as a papal fief, requiring formal investiture and tribute. While the crown possessed theoretical administrative powers like taxation and judicial authority, baronial autonomy often rendered these rights more symbolic than practical. Compared to Aragon's decentralized governance, Neapolitan royal power appeared more concentrated but was effectively limited by powerful noble interests.\n\nThe royal domain included extensive lands, yet feudal obligations remained complex and inconsistently enforced. Unlike Aragon's robust parliamentary system, Naples had a weaker legislative body with minimal capacity to challenge royal decrees.\n\nYou're absolutely right—I apologize for the error. Alfonso V had already conquered Naples years ago and ruled it until his death in September. René of Anjou was defeated and driven out long since; he's been in France nursing his grievances, not a present threat. The Neapolitan barons declared for you so readily because you're Alfonso's legitimate heir and they've heard of your reputation from Granada and Constantinople—not because you're liberating them from anyone.\n\nLet me recalibrate the scene properly.\n\nThe reception is warm, yes—the barons have chosen you over any potential Angevin resurgence, and your reputation precedes you. But this is a succession, not a liberation. Alfonso ruled here. These men knew him, served him, negotiated with him. Now they take the measure of his successor.\n\nDiego de Daza stands at your side as your galley is secured to the quay. The Neapolitan delegation waits with appropriate ceremony—the Prince of Taranto, the Caracciolo, the other great names—but the framing is different. This is a new king come to claim an established inheritance, not a savior arriving to rescue a desperate realm.\n\nAt your question, Diego's brow furrows. He speaks quietly, for your ears alone.\n\n\"Your Majesty, I must confess my knowledge of Neapolitan governance is... limited. I am a Castilian administrator. What I know comes from reports and correspondence, not direct experience.\"\n\nHe glances toward the waiting barons.\n\n\"But the broad strokes: Naples is not Aragón. There are no fueros here, no Justicia with power to void royal decrees. In theory, the crown's authority is far more direct.\" He pauses. \"In theory.\"\n\n\"The difficulty is twofold. First, Naples is a papal fief. The king holds the realm from the Holy Father and owes tribute and fealty to Rome. Pope Eugenius invested your cousin Alfonso after his conquest—you will need similar investiture, though given your relationship with the Holy See, this should not prove difficult.\"\n\n\"Second...\" Diego lowers his voice further. \"The barons. They have no constitutional limits on royal power because they do not need them. They simply are the power in much of the kingdom. Their lands, their castles, their private armies. Alfonso spent years trying to bring them to heel. He succeeded in some measure, but...\"\n\nHe shakes his head.\n\n\"I would recommend Your Majesty speak with those who know this kingdom better. Queen María knew Alfonso's struggles here. And perhaps—\" he gestures toward the delegation, \"—one of these lords might speak frankly, if asked the right questions.\"\n\nThe Prince of Taranto is approaching, ready to escort you to Castel Nuovo.\n\nDo you wish to ask him directly about the crown's rights and revenues? Or proceed to the castle first and gather information more discreetly?",

      "text": "1. Naples was a papal fief - the king held the realm from the Pope and owed tribute\n2. The kingdom had a feudal structure with powerful baronial families\n3. Alfonso V of Aragon conquered Naples in 1442 (in real history) after a long struggle\n4. The barons were extremely powerful and had essentially private armies\n5. Royal revenues came from:\n   - Royal demesne lands\n   - Customs duties (especially on trade through Naples' ports)\n   - The focatico (hearth tax)\n   - Various feudal dues\n   - Salt monopoly\n   - Judicial fines\n\nThe Prince of Taranto (Giovanni Antonio Orsini del Balzo) was historically one of the most powerful men in the kingdom - his principality was almost a state within a state. He would have complicated feelings about answering this question honestly.\n\nI should have him give a response that's:\n1. Polite and deferential on the surface\n2. But also reveals the reality that baronial power is immense\n3. Perhaps slightly evasive about the full extent of baronial independence\n4. Informative enough to be useful to Juan\n\nI should also remember the GM rules - I need to stop and let Juan respond, not carry the scene forward too much. This is a dialogue situation.\n\nThe Prince of Taranto's expression flickers—surprise, perhaps, or reassessment. New kings typically save such questions for private councils, not dockside conversations within earshot of half the nobility of Naples. But he recovers smoothly, gesturing for you to walk with him toward the waiting horses.\n\n\"Your Majesty asks directly,\" he says, falling into step beside you. His Italian is slower now, accommodating your comprehension. \"I appreciate directness. Your cousin Alfonso appreciated it less.\"\n\nHe waves a hand at the city rising above the harbor.\n\n\"The crown's rights in Naples are... extensive in theory. This is not Aragón, where kings must beg permission to collect their own revenues. Here, the king rules by right. No Justicia countermands him. No Cortes blocks his taxes.\" A slight smile. \"On parchment, you are nearly absolute.\"\n\n\"The revenues—\" He pauses to help you mount the horse that has been prepared, a fine destrier in the Aragonese style. Once you are both mounted, he continues.\n\n\"The focatico—the hearth tax—is the foundation. Every household in the kingdom owes the crown a fixed sum annually. In principle, this should yield perhaps 200,000 ducats.\" He stresses the word should meaningfully. \"Then customs duties on the ports—Naples, Gaeta, Salerno, others. The salt monopoly. Judicial revenues. Rights of escheat. In a well-ordered kingdom, the crown of Naples might collect 400,000 ducats annually. Perhaps more.\"\n\nThe Prince guides his horse up the steep street toward Castel Nuovo. Around you, the other barons follow at a respectful distance—close enough to observe, far enough to suggest they are not eavesdropping.\n\n\"Your cousin Alfonso,\" he continues, \"collected perhaps half that sum in his best years. The wars of conquest were expensive. The administration was... disrupted. Many rights that belong to the crown are currently exercised by others.\" He does not specify who these others might be, though his own presence rather answers the question. \"Restoring them would require time, effort, and—\" a careful pause \"—cooperation.\"\n\nHe looks at you sidelong.\n\n\"May I speak frankly, Your Majesty?\"",

      "text": "This should be realistic for 15th century Naples - a feudal kingdom where powerful barons hold significant local power, and the king's authority depends heavily on managing these relationships. The Prince should be politically savvy - he's speaking frankly but also representing his own interests.\n\nI should make this dialogue feel authentic to a powerful Italian nobleman of this era - proud, calculating, but also practical. He's chosen Juan and wants this to work, but he also wants to establish the parameters of the relationship.\n\nThe Prince reins his horse to a slower pace, allowing the gap between you and the following barons to widen slightly. When he speaks, his voice is lower, his Italian more colloquial.\n\n\"Your cousin Alfonso was a great warrior. He conquered this kingdom by force of arms and held it by force of will. We respected him.\" A pause. \"We did not love him.\"\n\nThe street narrows as you climb toward the castle. Neapolitan citizens press against the walls to let the procession pass, some calling out blessings, others simply staring.\n\n\"Alfonso saw Naples as a treasury to fund his ambitions. Wars in Italy. Dreams of Mediterranean empire. He taxed what he could, borrowed what he could not tax, and when neither sufficed, he sold offices and privileges.\" The Prince's tone is carefully neutral—stating facts, not complaints. \"The barons cooperated because he was strong. When he asked us to raise troops, we raised them. When he asked for donativi—'gifts'—we gave them. Because the alternative was a king who might take rather than ask.\"\n\nHe guides his horse around a cart that has stopped to let the procession pass.\n\n\"But this cooperation came at a price. Alfonso needed us, and we knew it. When royal officials tried to collect the focatico in our lands, we reminded them that our peasants owed us first, and the crown second. When royal judges tried to hear cases in our territories, we reminded them that our courts had precedence. When Alfonso wanted to appoint men to offices in provinces we controlled...\" The Prince spreads his hands. \"We reminded him that such appointments required local knowledge. Our knowledge.\"\n\nHe looks at you directly now, dark eyes assessing.\n\n\"You wish to know what rights the crown has in Naples. The answer is: all the rights you can enforce. No more. No less.\"\n\n\"The focatico should yield 200,000 ducats. It yields perhaps 80,000, because the rest is collected by lords who find reasons not to pass it upward. The customs should yield 150,000 ducats. They yield perhaps 100,000, because merchants find it cheaper to pay a baron to look away than to pay the full duty. The salt monopoly, the judicial revenues, the feudal incidents—all the same. Rights on parchment. Realities on the ground.\"\n\nThe massive walls of Castel Nuovo loom ahead now, the five great towers casting long shadows in the winter afternoon light.\n\n\"Your cousin spent ten years trying to change this. He made progress—more than the Angevins ever did. But progress, not victory.\" The Prince's voice carries something that might be respect. \"He was still fighting that battle when he died.\"\n\nHe stops his horse at the edge of the castle's great courtyard, turning to face you fully.\n\n\"Now you come to us, Your Majesty. King of Castile, where the crown is strong. King of Aragón, where you have just sworn to respect limits on royal power. And now King of Naples, where the limits are not written in fueros but carved into the land itself—every castle, every private army, every baron who remembers that his grandfather made and unmade kings.\"\n\n\"So I will tell you what we expect, since you have asked for frankness.\"\n\nHe counts on his fingers, thick and calloused from years of holding sword and rein.\n\n\"First: confirm our privileges. What we hold, we keep. What Alfonso granted us, you honor. No sudden investigations into how we acquired what we have.\"\n\n\"Second: consult us. When you make decisions about this kingdom, include us in the making. We are not Castilian nobles to be overawed by royal magnificence. We are the men who chose you, when we might have chosen otherwise.\"\n\n\"Third: defend us. The Angevins still dream of return. The Pope plays his own games. The Turk presses the eastern shores. We chose you because you are strong. Remain strong.\"\n\n\"In exchange—\" He gestures at the castle, the city, the kingdom beyond. \"We will be loyal. We will pay what we have customarily paid. We will fight in your wars, within reason. We will not conspire against you, so long as you do not move against us.\"\n\nHis eyes meet yours.\n\n\"These are the terms your cousin accepted, in practice if not in writing. The question, Your Majesty, is whether you will accept them as well—or whether you intend something different.\"",

      "text": "The focatico was indeed the main direct tax in the Kingdom of Naples. It was assessed per household (hearth/fuoco). The rate varied but was typically around 1 ducat per hearth annually, though this could be modified.\n\nCollection was a major issue. In theory, royal officials should collect it directly. In practice, the barons often collected it in their territories and were supposed to pass it on to the crown, minus various deductions and exemptions they claimed.\n\nThe exemptions came from multiple sources:\n1. Noble households were often exempt\n2. Ecclesiastical properties were exempt\n3. Cities and towns sometimes had charters exempting them or reducing their rates\n4. Individual barons had privileges allowing them to retain a portion\n5. Some areas had been granted to barons \"in feudum\" with tax rights included\n\nAlfonso didn't necessarily grant all these exemptions - many were inherited from Angevin times or even earlier. But he did grant some new ones as rewards for support during his conquest.\n\nThe rate was typically around 1 ducat per hearth, though this varied. Sometimes additional \"extraordinary\" focatico was levied for wars.\n\nLet me have the Prince explain this in accessible terms while remaining historically grounded.\n\nThe Prince laughs—not mockingly, but with genuine amusement.\n\n\"You truly do ask directly. Your cousin would have pretended to know and asked his secretaries in private.\" He settles more comfortably in his saddle, seemingly pleased to explain. \"Very well. A lesson in Neapolitan governance, here in the street like merchants haggling over fish.\"\n\nHe holds up one finger.\n\n\"The focatico. The hearth tax. Every household in the kingdom—every fuoco, every hearth—owes the crown a fixed sum each year. One ducat per hearth, more or less, though some districts pay slightly different rates based on old agreements.\"\n\n\"How many hearths in Naples? The last census that anyone believes—and no one entirely believes it—counted perhaps 300,000 hearths in the kingdom. So in theory: 300,000 ducats.\" He shrugs. \"In practice, perhaps 80,000 reaches the royal treasury. Where does the rest go?\"\n\nHe begins counting on his fingers again, clearly enjoying the role of teacher.\n\n\"First: exemptions. Not granted by Alfonso—older than that. The Church pays nothing. Ecclesiastical lands, monasteries, cathedral chapters—exempt since time immemorial. That removes perhaps 30,000 hearths from the count.\"\n\n\"Second: the cities. Naples itself, and other major towns, have ancient charters. They pay a fixed sum negotiated generations ago, regardless of how many hearths they actually contain. Naples has grown since those charters were written. The crown receives what it received in 1350, while the city holds three times the population.\"\n\n\"Third: noble households. A baron's own household, his castle, his direct retainers—exempt. This is a small matter in itself, but...\"\n\nHe pauses, choosing his words.\n\n\"Fourth—and here is where the money truly vanishes—the baronial lands themselves. When a king grants land to a baron in feudum, the grant often includes the right to collect the focatico from that territory. The baron collects. The baron is supposed to pass the revenue to the crown, minus a customary share for the cost of collection.\"\n\nThe Prince's smile turns sardonic.\n\n\"In practice? The baron collects. The baron keeps. When the royal treasury sends letters asking for the crown's portion, the baron sends letters back explaining that the harvest was poor, or bandits raided, or plague struck, or the peasants fled, or—\" he waves his hand, \"—some other reason why the collection fell short. The royal officials are welcome to come and inspect, of course. They will find the baron's men-at-arms very helpful in showing them around.\"\n\n\"As for collection itself—\" He gestures down at the city below. \"In royal lands, where the crown has direct authority, tax collectors appointed by the treasury visit each district. They count hearths, assess payments, collect the coin. This works tolerably well, when the collectors are honest and the local officials cooperate.\"\n\n\"In baronial lands, the baron collects through his own agents. The peasants pay him. He is supposed to pass the crown's share onward.\" The Prince's expression makes clear how often this actually happens.\n\n\"Your cousin Alfonso tried to reform this. He sent royal commissioners to conduct new censuses. He demanded accurate accounts. He threatened to revoke the grants of barons who could not explain where the money went.\" A pause. \"He made enemies. Some of those enemies are now dead. Others are—\" he glances back at the trailing barons \"—currently riding to your coronation, expressing their loyalty.\"\n\nHe leans closer, lowering his voice.\n\n\"You wish to understand why I am telling you this so freely? Because I am one of the honest ones—relatively speaking. My lands pay what they owe, near enough. I have nothing to fear from royal commissioners.\" His eyes flick toward the other barons. \"Others are not so sanguine. They watch you now, wondering if the king who reformed Castile and swore to respect the fueros of Aragón will try to reform them.\"\n\n\"So I offer you advice, Your Majesty, which you may take or leave as you choose: the focatico is a trap. Every king who has tried to reform it has found himself fighting his own barons instead of his enemies. Alfonso spent years on it and won perhaps 20,000 additional ducats annually—at the cost of goodwill he could never rebuild.\"\n\nHe straightens in his saddle as the castle gates loom.\n\n\"The kings who have succeeded in Naples are those who found other sources of revenue. Trade. The ports. New ventures. Sources that do not require reaching into a baron's pocket to extract what he considers already his.\"\n\nThe gates of Castel Nuovo swing open before you. Inside, the great courtyard swarms with activity—servants, soldiers, officials preparing for your arrival.\n\nThe Prince of Taranto poses his question again, this time explicitly:\n\n\"Your cousin left unfinished business here. Reforms half-implemented. Commissioners still investigating. Barons still uncertain whether the new census will cost them their revenues.\"\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\"What would Your Majesty have us expect?\"",

But in practice, the barons had made their lands nearly hereditary and autonomous\n\nThe legal theory versus practice tension is key here. In theory:\n- Feudal grants were conditional on service\n- Felony (breach of feudal obligation) could lead to forfeiture\n- The king as sovereign had ultimate authority\n\nIn practice:\n- Baronial families had held lands for generations\n- Attempts to revoke grants led to rebellion\n- The barons had private armies that made enforcement difficult\n\nThe Prince of Taranto would know this tension well. He's being very frank with Juan, so he should give an honest answer that captures both the legal theory and the practical reality.\n\nI should have him explain:\n1. The legal theory - yes, feudal grants can be revoked for cause\n2. The practical limitations - trying to do so causes war\n3. The specific mechanisms (felony, escheat, etc.)\n4. Why Alfonso didn't simply revoke grants from troublesome barons\n\nThis is a good opportunity for the Prince to continue being educational while also subtly warning Juan about the limits of royal power in Naples.\n\nThe Prince of Taranto's eyebrows rise. He studies you for a long moment, and something shifts in his expression—a new wariness, perhaps, or a deepening respect. Or both.\n\n\"Now that,\" he says slowly, \"is the question Alfonso asked in his third year. Before he asked it, the barons thought him a foreign conqueror to be tolerated. After he asked it, they understood he meant to be a king.\"\n\nHe does not answer immediately. Instead, he swings down from his horse as you enter the courtyard, waiting for you to dismount as well. Grooms rush forward to take the reins. Only when you are both standing on the worn flagstones, slightly apart from the bustling servants, does he continue.\n\n\"The legal answer is yes. Absolutely yes.\"\n\nHe begins walking slowly toward the great entrance of the castle, pitching his voice so only you can hear.\n\n\"A feudal grant is not a gift. It is a contract. The king grants land and the revenues thereof; the vassal owes service, loyalty, and obedience in return. If the vassal fails in his obligations—if he commits felonia—the grant is forfeit. The land returns to the crown.\"\n\n\"What constitutes felony? Treason, obviously. Taking arms against the king. But also: failure to provide military service when summoned. Failure to pay what is owed to the crown. Failure to administer justice properly in one's lands. Refusal to obey a lawful royal command.\"\n\nHe pauses at the base of a grand staircase, turning to face you.\n\n\"By strict legal interpretation, Your Majesty, half the barons of Naples are in a state of ongoing felony. They have not paid what they owe. They have obstructed royal officials. They have appropriated revenues that belong to the crown. Alfonso's lawyers compiled dossiers thick as Bibles documenting violations.\"\n\n\"So why did he not simply revoke their grants?\"\n\nThe Prince's smile is thin.\n\n\"Because law is not reality. A grant can only be revoked if it can be enforced. When Alfonso moved against the Count of Celano for documented felonies—treason during the conquest, actually—it took him two years and four thousand men to seize a single castle. The count's neighbors watched carefully. Some quietly aided him. All understood that if the king could break Celano today, he could break them tomorrow.\"\n\nHe gestures at the castle walls around you.\n\n\"Naples is not Castile, where the crown spent centuries breaking the nobility's military power. Here, every baron is a small king in his own lands. Private armies. Fortified castles. Networks of alliance and marriage binding them together. Move against one, and you must be prepared to move against all—because all will see themselves threatened.\"\n\nHe begins climbing the stairs, and you fall into step beside him.\n\n\"Alfonso found a middle path. He did not attempt mass revocations. Instead, he used the threat of revocation as leverage. When a baron proved troublesome, Alfonso's lawyers would produce the dossier. 'Look,' they would say, 'at all these documented violations. The king would be within his rights to take everything. But His Majesty is merciful. Perhaps we can reach an understanding.'\"\n\n\"The understanding usually involved the baron paying a large fine, accepting a royal official in his territory, or providing troops for Alfonso's wars. The grant remained intact. The baron remained in possession. But he understood that his tenure was conditional on good behavior—and that the dossier remained in the royal archives, ready to be produced again.\"\n\nThe Prince stops at a landing where tall windows overlook the bay. Ships move in the harbor below, tiny from this height.\n\n\"Some barons learned. They became cooperative, even loyal. Others...\" He shrugs. \"Others calculated that Alfonso would not live forever. That a new king might be less vigorous. That dossiers could be lost, officials bribed, memories dimmed.\"\n\nHe turns to look at you directly.\n\n\"So yes, Your Majesty. You have the right to revoke grants for cause. You have the right to amend them. You have the right to demand accountings, to send commissioners, to enforce the terms that your predecessors let slide.\"\n\n\"Whether you have the power to do so is another question. It depends on how many barons you wish to fight, how long you wish to fight them, and what you are willing to spend in blood and gold to establish a principle.\"\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\"Your cousin spent ten years on this. He made progress. Real progress. The barons are more obedient now than when the Angevins ruled. But he did it slowly, carefully, one troublesome lord at a time—always with overwhelming force, always with legal justification, always leaving the others room to believe they were safe so long as they behaved.\"\n\nFrom below, you hear the sounds of the other barons entering the courtyard, their voices echoing off the stone walls.\n\n\"I tell you this,\" the Prince says quietly, \"because you asked. And because I would rather you understood the kingdom you are inheriting than learned these lessons through costly mistakes.\"\n\n\"The dossiers still exist. Alfonso's commissioners are still at work. The investigations are still ongoing. You could continue his approach—slow pressure, selective enforcement, gradual expansion of royal authority.\"\n\n\"Or—\" He watches your face carefully. \"You could do something else entirely. You are not Alfonso. You have resources he did not. Three crowns now, not one. The prestige of Granada. The friendship of Rome. Perhaps you see possibilities that he did not.\"\n\nThe other barons are climbing the stairs now. The Prince's voice drops further.\n\n\"But whatever you choose, Your Majesty, understand this: we are watching. All of us. Every baron in this kingdom is asking himself the same question right now—what kind of king will Juan of Castile be? The answer you give in these first weeks will shape everything that follows.\"\n\nHe straightens, his voice returning to normal volume as the first of the other lords reaches the landing.\n\n\"Shall I show Your Majesty to the royal apartments? The servants have prepared everything for your arrival.\"",

If they forgive back taxes owed under Alfonso, would they still have the right to conduct a new census and potentially increase future taxes based on actual hearth counts?\n\nThis is a clever political maneuver they're considering - amnesty for past debts in exchange for accepting a new, more accurate assessment system going forward.\n\nLet me think about how the Prince of Taranto would respond to this. He's been frank and helpful so far, seemingly one of the \"honest\" barons who doesn't have as much to fear from royal scrutiny. He would recognize the cleverness of this approach.\n\nThe focatico (hearth tax) is based on the number of hearths in a territory. The rate is roughly fixed (about 1 ducat per hearth), but the NUMBER of hearths is what's disputed. Old censuses undercount the population. Barons have incentive to report fewer hearths than actually exist.\n\nSo if Juan:\n1. Forgives all back taxes owed under Alfonso\n2. Conducts a new, accurate census\n3. Applies the same rate to the new, accurate count\n\nHe would:\n- Remove the grievance of the dossiers and threatened revocations\n- Establish a fresh baseline that reflects actual population\n- Potentially dramatically increase future revenues without changing the rate\n\nThis is exactly the kind of clever administrative thinking that would impress the Prince - and possibly alarm him, because it's a sophisticated approach that could actually work.\n\nThe Prince would need to explain:\n- Yes, the rate is roughly fixed, but the count is what matters\n- A new census could indeed reveal many more hearths\n- This approach has been tried before - barons have ways of resisting censuses\n- But it's a smarter approach than trying to collect back taxes\n\nI should have the Prince respond with a mix of impressed recognition of Juan's cleverness and practical warnings about implementation challenges.\n\nThe Prince of Taranto stops mid-step. He turns to look at you, and for the first time since the docks, his carefully composed expression cracks into something genuine—a flash of surprise, followed by what might be admiration, followed by something that looks very much like concern.\n\n\"Ah,\" he says softly. \"You are different.\"\n\nHe glances down the stairs at the approaching barons, then takes your arm with surprising familiarity, guiding you through a side door into a smaller chamber—an antechamber of some kind, furnished with faded tapestries and a single window overlooking an interior courtyard. The sounds of the arriving lords fade behind the heavy door.\n\n\"Forgive the presumption, Your Majesty, but this conversation should not be overheard.\"\n\nHe releases your arm and stands facing you, his bulk filling much of the small room.\n\n\"You are correct. Entirely correct. The rate of the focatico is fixed—roughly one ducat per hearth, with minor variations. What is not fixed is the number of hearths. The old censuses—some dating to the Angevin period, some to the chaos before Alfonso's conquest—drastically undercount the population. Naples has grown. New villages have been founded. Old villages have expanded. Peasants have married, built houses, established new households.\"\n\nHe begins pacing, energy in his movements now.\n\n\"If the crown were to conduct a new census—a true census, accurate and comprehensive—it would find perhaps twice as many hearths as the old records show. Perhaps more. Suddenly the focatico owed is not 300,000 ducats in theory and 80,000 in practice. It is 500,000 ducats in theory, and if properly collected...\"\n\nHe trails off, looking at you with new eyes.\n\n\"And you propose to forgive the back taxes. The debts that Alfonso accumulated against us. The dossiers, the documented arrears, the legal leverage that every baron in this kingdom fears.\"\n\nHe laughs—a short, sharp sound.\n\n\"Do you understand what you are offering? You would remove the sword hanging over every lord's head. No more fear of sudden revocation. No more commissioners poring over decades of records looking for discrepancies. A clean slate.\"\n\n\"In exchange—\" His eyes narrow. \"In exchange, we accept a new census. A true count. And whatever that count reveals, we pay. Not the old amounts based on outdated records, but the real amounts based on actual hearths.\"\n\nHe stops pacing and faces you squarely.\n\n\"It is clever. It is very clever. You give us what we want most—security, legitimacy, an end to the constant threat—and in return you get what Alfonso spent ten years fighting for. More revenue than he ever collected, without having to enforce a single revocation.\"\n\nHe is quiet for a moment, thinking.\n\n\"There are complications. There are always complications.\"\n\nHe holds up one finger. \"First: the census itself. Who conducts it? If royal officials alone, the barons will not trust the count—they will assume the numbers are inflated to justify higher taxes. If baronial officials alone, the crown will not trust it—the numbers will be deflated to minimize payments. Some joint mechanism would be needed.\"\n\nA second finger. \"Second: the Church. Ecclesiastical lands are currently exempt. They have been exempt for centuries. Will you attempt to include them in the new census? The bishops will resist. Rome will have opinions.\"\n\nA third finger. \"Third: the cities. Their fixed payments are enshrined in ancient charters. Legally, you could argue those charters should be renegotiated to reflect true population. Practically, the cities will scream that you are violating their privileges. Urban riots are not unknown in Naples.\"\n\nA fourth finger. \"Fourth: enforcement. Even with a new census, even with agreed numbers, the tax must still be collected. If a baron simply refuses to pay the new amount—claims hardship, delays, obstructs—you face the same problem Alfonso faced. Do you send soldiers? Do you threaten revocation? You are back where you started.\"\n\nHe lowers his hand.\n\n\"But.\"\n\nThe word hangs in the air.\n\n\"But these are obstacles, not impossibilities. The joint census could work—royal commissioners paired with local notables, each watching the other. The Church could be addressed separately, perhaps through Rome. The cities could be negotiated with—new charters in exchange for other concessions. And enforcement...\"\n\nHe looks at you appraisingly.\n\n\"Enforcement depends on whether the barons believe you are serious. Alfonso was serious, and we knew it, and so we yielded—slowly, grudgingly, but we yielded. If you demonstrate the same resolve, with the same willingness to crush those who defy you openly...\"\n\nHe shrugs.\n\n\"Many will calculate that paying the higher tax is cheaper than fighting the king who conquered Granada.\"\n\nHe moves to the window, looking down at the courtyard below where servants scurry about their duties.\n\n\"I will tell you something, Your Majesty, that I would not tell you if I thought you were an ordinary king. What you propose could work. It could genuinely work. Not immediately—it would take years to implement fully. But the logic is sound. Amnesty in exchange for accuracy. Security in exchange for revenue. Both sides gain something real.\"\n\nHe turns back to you.\n\n\"The question is whether you can convince the other barons of this. They are not stupid men, but they are suspicious men. They have been promised reforms before. They have been promised that cooperation will be rewarded. And they have learned that kings' promises last only as long as kings' memories.\"\n\n\"If you offer this bargain, you must make them believe it is genuine. That the amnesty is real and permanent. That the dossiers will be burned, not merely filed away for future use. That the new system, once established, will not become another tool for royal extortion.\"\n\nHe studies your face.\n\n\"You would need to put it in writing. Something formal. Something that binds you and your successors. Something that the barons can point to if a future king tries to resurrect the old claims.\"\n\nA pause.\n\n\"You have just come from Aragón, where you swore to respect the fueros. The barons of Naples have no fueros—but they understand the concept of a king who binds himself by oath. If you were to propose something similar here...\"\n\nHe does not finish the sentence. Instead, he asks:\n\n\"Is this what you intend, Your Majesty? Or am I reading too much into a question?\"",

Feudal incidents (relief, wardship, escheat, marriage)\n6. Royal domain revenues (crown lands)\n7. Donativi (extraordinary grants from barons/estates)\n8. Possibly taxes on specific goods or industries\n\nI should present this in a historically accurate way. The Kingdom of Naples in this period had a complex fiscal system inherited from Norman, Hohenstaufen, and Angevin rulers.\n\nThe Prince nods, seemingly pleased that you wish to understand the full picture before making decisions.\n\n\"The focatico is the foundation—the largest single source of revenue, and the most contested. But there are others.\"\n\nHe ticks them off on his fingers, settling into the role of instructor once more.\n\n\"The customs duties—dohana. Every port in the kingdom collects taxes on goods entering and leaving. Naples itself is the greatest, but Gaeta, Salerno, Bari, Taranto, Brindisi, Reggio—all collect. The rates vary by commodity: grain, wine, oil, cloth, spices, slaves.\" He shrugs. \"In theory, perhaps 150,000 ducats annually. In practice, closer to 100,000. Smuggling is endemic. Merchants bribe officials. Some ports are controlled by barons who... interpret the rates creatively.\"\n\n\"But—\" he raises a finger \"—the customs are easier to reform than the focatico. The trade flows through fixed points. A competent official at each port, properly supervised, can collect what is owed. Alfonso improved the customs significantly. There is room for further improvement, but the infrastructure exists.\"\n\n\"The salt monopoly—gabella del sale. The crown controls all salt production and sale in the kingdom. Salt is life—every household needs it, every fisherman, every farmer preserving meat. The monopoly is ancient and well-established.\"\n\nHe grimaces slightly.\n\n\"In theory, perhaps 40,000 ducats. In practice, perhaps 30,000. The losses here are less from baronial interference than from simple corruption. The officials who manage the salt warehouses skim. The merchants who distribute it cheat on weights. Everyone steals a little. It adds up.\"\n\n\"Reform is possible but tedious. Better accounting, more inspections, rotating officials so they cannot build comfortable relationships with the merchants they supervise. Alfonso began this work. It continues.\"\n\n\"Judicial revenues—fines, fees, confiscations. When royal courts hear cases, they collect fees. When criminals are convicted, their property may be forfeit. When disputes are settled, both parties pay.\"\n\nHe waves a hand dismissively.\n\n\"Perhaps 20,000 ducats in a good year. More if there happens to be a wealthy traitor whose estates are confiscated. Less if the kingdom is peaceful and law-abiding.\" A dry smile. \"Naples is rarely peaceful and law-abiding, so the revenue is fairly consistent.\"\n\n\"The difficulty here is that royal justice competes with baronial justice. In their own lands, the barons hear cases, collect fines, keep the revenues. Only cases involving nobles directly, or appeals from baronial courts, reach the royal judiciary. Alfonso tried to expand royal jurisdiction. The barons resisted. The boundaries remain... contested.\"\n\n\"Feudal incidents—the traditional rights of a lord over his vassals. When a baron dies, his heir pays relief to the crown for the privilege of inheriting. When a baron dies leaving a minor heir, the crown has wardship—the right to manage the estate and collect its revenues until the heir comes of age. When a baron dies without heirs, the land escheats—returns to the crown entirely. When a baron's widow or daughter wishes to marry, the crown may claim a fee for permission.\"\n\nHe shrugs.\n\n\"Unpredictable. Perhaps 10,000 ducats in a quiet year. Perhaps 50,000 if a great lord dies without heirs and his estates revert. Alfonso was... diligent... in pursuing these rights. Some felt too diligent. There were accusations that he hastened certain lords toward death to claim their estates sooner.\"\n\nA careful pause.\n\n\"I make no such accusations myself, of course.\"\n\n\"The royal domain—crown lands held directly, not granted out in fief. Farms, forests, mines, fisheries. These generate revenue like any estate, through rents and production.\"\n\nHe sighs.\n\n\"Once, the royal domain was vast. Generations of kings have whittled it away, granting lands to reward followers or raise quick money. What remains is perhaps 30,000 ducats annually. Alfonso tried to rebuild it—confiscating estates from traitors, purchasing lands when opportunity arose. But the domain remains a shadow of what it was under the Normans.\"\n\n\"The donativi—extraordinary grants. When the king requires money beyond ordinary revenues—for war, for emergency, for great undertakings—he may request gifts from the barons and cities. These are theoretically voluntary.\"\n\nThe Prince's expression suggests how voluntary they actually are.\n\n\"Alfonso requested donativi frequently. For his Italian wars, for his fleet, for the defense of the realm. We paid. What choice did we have? But each request bred resentment. And each time, the barons extracted concessions in return—confirmations of privileges, exemptions, promises.\"\n\nHe spreads his hands.\n\n\"The donativi could yield 100,000 ducats or more in a single year. But they cannot be demanded regularly without exhausting goodwill entirely. Alfonso learned this. By the end, his requests were met with... reluctance.\"\n\nHe falls silent for a moment, calculating.\n\n\"Sum it all: the focatico should yield 300,000 but yields 80,000. The customs should yield 150,000 but yield 100,000. The salt monopoly, 30,000. Judicial revenues, 20,000. Feudal incidents, variable—call it 15,000 in an average year. The royal domain, 30,000.\"\n\n\"Total: perhaps 275,000 ducats in ordinary revenue. In a good year, with a donativo, perhaps 350,000 or 400,000.\"\n\nHe looks at you steadily.\n\n\"Your cousin Alfonso, with all his reforms and pressures, collected perhaps 300,000 in his best years. The potential—if the focatico were properly assessed and collected, if the customs were tightened, if the domain were rebuilt—is perhaps 500,000 or more.\"\n\n\"The question, as always, is how to close that gap without starting a war with your own subjects.\"\n\nHe tilts his head.\n\n\"The focatico amnesty you propose would address the largest single source of lost revenue. The customs could be reformed through better administration—less dramatic, but achievable. The salt monopoly, the same. The judicial revenues and feudal incidents are what they are. The domain could be rebuilt slowly, over generations.\"\n\n\"But all of it depends on one thing: whether the barons believe you are a king worth cooperating with. Fear worked for Alfonso—barely, and at great cost in resentment. You seem to be considering a different approach.\"\n\nHis eyes are curious now, genuinely interested.\n\n\"Am I correct?\"",

      "text": "The Prince of Taranto is a powerful baron who would have knowledge about this. Let me think about what the historical situation would have been:\n\n1. Roads in medieval Southern Italy - The Roman road network had deteriorated significantly by the 15th century. The Via Appia and other ancient roads existed but were in poor repair. Brigandage was common. Trade moved more safely by sea than by land.\n\n2. Ports - Naples had significant ports. The kingdom's geography (long coastline, mountainous interior) made maritime trade more practical than overland trade in many cases.\n\n3. The Prince of Taranto specifically - Taranto is a major port city on the heel of Italy. He would have personal interest in maritime infrastructure.\n\nI should have the Prince respond with practical knowledge about:\n- The state of roads (probably poor, Roman infrastructure decayed)\n- The state of ports (variable, some better than others)\n- Which investments would yield returns\n- The political implications of such investments (who benefits, who might resist)\n\nThis is also an opportunity for the Prince to continue assessing Juan - a king who asks about infrastructure investment rather than just taxation is unusual and noteworthy.\n\nThe Prince's eyebrows rise again—and this time he does not try to hide his surprise.\n\n\"Roads? Ports?\" He stares at you for a moment, then laughs—a genuine sound, warmer than before. \"Your Majesty, I have counseled three kings of Naples. Not one of them ever asked me about roads.\"\n\nHe moves back to the window, looking out thoughtfully.\n\n\"Alfonso asked about revenues. About which barons could be trusted. About ships for his wars. The Angevins before him asked about luxuries for the court, about money for French adventures, about which families to favor and which to destroy.\" He shakes his head. \"Infrastructure. Investment. You speak like a merchant, Your Majesty. I mean no offense—it is refreshing.\"\n\nHe turns back to you, his expression more animated now.\n\n\"Very well. Let me tell you about the bones of this kingdom.\"\n\n\"The roads first. We have Roman roads—or what remains of them. The Via Appia runs from Rome through Capua to Brindisi. The Via Popilia connects to Reggio and Sicily. Other ancient routes crisscross the realm.\" He grimaces. \"In theory.\"\n\n\"In practice? The roads have not been properly maintained since the Empire fell. A thousand years of neglect. The paving stones are torn up for building material. Bridges collapse and are replaced with fords—or not replaced at all. Bandits infest the mountain passes. A merchant traveling from Naples to Taranto by land needs armed escort and a week of hard travel. The same journey by sea takes two days.\"\n\nHe spreads his hands.\n\n\"So the trade moves by water. Always by water. The interior of the kingdom—the mountains, the hill towns, the agricultural heartland—is isolated. Peasants grow grain and cannot bring it to market because the roads are impassable in winter. Villages that could trade with each other instead remain closed economies, everyone poor together.\"\n\n\"Could the roads be repaired? Yes. Should they be? Also yes—eventually. But the cost would be enormous. You would need to rebuild bridges, repave stretches that have become mud tracks, establish way-stations and patrols to suppress brigandage. Years of work. Tens of thousands of ducats.\"\n\nHe pauses, considering.\n\n\"The return would be real but slow. Better roads mean more trade. More trade means more customs revenue, more prosperity, more taxable wealth. But you would not see significant returns for a decade or more. And the investment would benefit primarily the interior—the baronial lands, the agricultural districts. The barons themselves would profit most.\"\n\nA slight smile.\n\n\"Which is not necessarily an argument against it. Barons who are prospering are barons who have something to lose. They become more invested in stability, in royal authority that protects their newfound wealth. But you should understand who benefits.\"\n\n\"The ports are different.\"\n\nHe moves closer, his voice taking on a more eager quality.\n\n\"Naples has the finest natural harbor in Italy—perhaps in the Mediterranean. Deep water, sheltered from storms, positioned perfectly for trade with the East, with Africa, with Spain, with everywhere. The city thrives on commerce. Always has.\"\n\n\"But the facilities—\" He shakes his head. \"The docks are ancient. The warehouses are cramped. The customs house is too small; merchants wait days to have their goods assessed. The shipyards can repair vessels but struggle to build new ones—they lack proper dry docks, adequate timber supplies, skilled workers.\"\n\n\"Gaeta, Salerno, Bari—similar stories. Good harbors, poor infrastructure. Ships come because they must, not because the ports serve them well.\"\n\n\"Investment here would yield faster returns. A new warehouse district in Naples would pay for itself in increased customs within five years—merchants would route more cargo through a port that can actually handle it. Expanded shipyards would let us build vessels here instead of buying them from Genoa and Venice. Better docks mean faster loading, faster turnaround, more ships served per season.\"\n\nHe ticks off possibilities on his fingers.\n\n\"Dredging the harbor approaches—some have silted since Roman times. Building proper breakwaters to expand the sheltered anchorage. Constructing a new customs facility where inspections can happen efficiently. Establishing royal warehouses where goods can be stored securely, reducing theft and spoilage.\"\n\n\"For perhaps 20,000 ducats invested over three years, you could transform the port of Naples. For another 30,000 spread across Gaeta, Salerno, Taranto, and Bari, you could make the kingdom's entire coastline more valuable.\"\n\nHe pauses, looking at you shrewdly.\n\n\"There is another consideration. Roads benefit barons—their lands, their peasants, their agricultural output. Ports benefit merchants and cities. If you invest heavily in ports while neglecting roads, you signal whose prosperity matters to you.\"\n\n\"The barons will notice. They always notice.\"\n\n\"But—\" He holds up a finger. \"The ports also benefit the crown more directly. Customs duties are royal revenue, collected at fixed points, harder to evade than the focatico. Every ducat of increased trade flows partially into your treasury. Roads improve the kingdom's wealth generally; ports improve the kingdom's wealth in ways you can actually capture.\"\n\nHe is quiet for a moment, thinking.\n\n\"If I were advising you—and I suppose I am, though I did not expect to be when I woke this morning—I would say this:\"\n\n\"Begin with the ports. Quick investment, visible improvement, returns within years rather than decades. Use the increased customs revenue to fund the slower work on roads. Show the cities that you care about their prosperity; show the merchants that partnership with the crown is profitable.\"\n\n\"Then, as revenues grow, extend your attention inland. Repair the major routes first—the Via Appia, the connections between major cities. Establish royal patrols to suppress brigandage. Let the barons see that your investments benefit them too, in time.\"\n\nHe smiles slightly.\n\n\"It is a strategy that costs relatively little in the short term, generates goodwill with multiple factions, and builds toward genuine improvement over the long term. Alfonso never thought this way. He saw Naples as a purse to be emptied, not a garden to be cultivated.\"\n\nHe looks at you with something approaching genuine respect.\n\n\"You have asked me about taxes, about legal rights, about investment. You have not asked me about which barons to favor, which enemies to crush, which women at court might warm your bed.\"\n\n\"Either you are a very unusual king, Your Majesty, or you are testing me in ways I do not yet understand.\"\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\"Which is it?\"",

Actually, Naples is \"Regno di Sicilia citra Pharum\" - the Kingdom of Sicily on this side of the strait, meaning mainland southern Italy. Sicily itself was a separate kingdom.)\n\n2. Roman roads in disrepair would need:\n- Repaving with stone\n- Bridge reconstruction\n- Drainage systems\n- Way stations\n- Patrols/security\n\n3. Labor costs in 15th century Italy would be significant but labor was relatively cheap. Materials (stone, timber for scaffolding, etc.) would be the major expense along with skilled engineers.\n\n4. For comparison, building a cathedral might cost 50,000-100,000 ducats over decades. A major bridge might be 5,000-20,000 ducats depending on size.\n\n5. The Via Appia from Rome to Brindisi is about 350 miles. The Via Popilia to Reggio adds another significant stretch.\n\nLet me think about realistic numbers:\n- Major bridge reconstruction: 2,000-10,000 ducats per bridge depending on size\n- Road repaving per mile: maybe 50-200 ducats per mile for basic repairs, more for full reconstruction\n- There might be dozens of bridges needed and hundreds of miles of road\n\nThe Prince should give rough estimates but acknowledge uncertainty - he's a baron, not an engineer. He might suggest that proper surveys would be needed.\n\nA realistic total for significant restoration might be:\n- 100,000-200,000 ducats for the major routes over 5-10 years\n- Much more for comprehensive restoration of all roads\n\nThis would be a massive investment - perhaps half or more of the kingdom's annual revenue for several years.\n \nRestoring ancient infrastructure presents unique challenges. With no recent precedent since Roman times, the Prince recognizes the complexity of such an ambitious undertaking. Consulting specialized engineers and studying restoration efforts in other Italian states would provide crucial insights into the feasibility and potential approaches for this massive infrastructure project.\n\nThe Prince blows out a breath, rubbing his chin thoughtfully.\n\n\"Now you ask me questions I cannot answer with precision. I am a soldier and a landholder, Your Majesty, not an engineer. But I have administered my own estates for thirty years, and I have watched Alfonso attempt repairs on the routes through my territory. So I can give you rough figures—very rough.\"\n\nHe moves to a small table in the corner of the antechamber, where someone has left writing materials. He does not write, but gestures as if sketching a map.\n\n\"Consider the major routes first. The Via Appia runs from the papal border through Capua to Naples, then onward to Benevento, and from there to Taranto and Brindisi. Call it three hundred miles within our kingdom. The Via Popilia branches south from Capua through Salerno, down the coast to Reggio—another two hundred miles perhaps. Then lesser routes connecting the major cities: Naples to Salerno directly, Benevento to Bari, Taranto to Brindisi, and so forth.\"\n\n\"In total, the major routes—the ones that matter for significant trade and military movement—perhaps six or seven hundred miles. The secondary routes, connecting smaller towns? Another thousand miles, maybe more. And the local tracks that peasants use to reach markets?\" He shrugs. \"Countless. We will not speak of those.\"\n\n\"For the major routes, the costs vary enormously depending on condition.\"\n\nHe holds up fingers as he estimates.\n\n\"Some stretches are merely neglected—the Roman paving still exists beneath mud and overgrowth. Clear the debris, repair the drainage ditches, fill the worst holes. Perhaps fifty ducats per mile. Maybe less if you can conscript local labor.\"\n\n\"Other stretches are truly destroyed—the stones carted away, the roadbed eroded, bridges collapsed entirely. These require full reconstruction. New stone must be quarried and hauled. Foundations must be relaid. Skilled masons must be hired.\" He grimaces. \"Two hundred ducats per mile. Perhaps three hundred in difficult terrain—mountains, marshes, places where the work is slow and dangerous.\"\n\n\"Bridges are the great expense. A small bridge over a stream—timber construction, nothing elaborate—perhaps five hundred ducats. A major bridge over a river? Stone arches, proper foundations?\" He shakes his head. \"Five thousand ducats. Ten thousand for the largest crossings. And there are dozens of bridges needed. Scores, perhaps.\"\n\nHe pauses, calculating silently.\n\n\"If I were to guess—and it is only a guess—restoring the major routes to something resembling Roman functionality would cost perhaps 150,000 to 200,000 ducats. Spread over many years, using a mix of paid labor and corvée, reusing materials where possible, prioritizing the most critical sections.\"\n\n\"That is for roads passable by carts in all seasons, with bridges sound enough for heavy loads, with drainage sufficient to prevent washing out in winter rains.\"\n\nHe looks at you seriously.\n\n\"It is an enormous sum. More than half your annual revenue, even if collection improves. And it would take years—five years at minimum for the major routes, ten years or more to do it properly. You cannot simply throw money at roads; you need engineers, skilled workers, materials, organization. And every year you are spending on roads is a year you are not spending on ships, or soldiers, or other priorities.\"\n\n\"There is another approach,\" he adds, his tone more thoughtful now. \"You need not restore everything at once. You could prioritize.\"\n\n\"The route from Naples to Capua and onward to Rome—that is the kingdom's connection to the rest of Italy, to the papacy, to trade with the north. Perhaps eighty miles within our borders. Critical bridges, perhaps a dozen. Full restoration might cost 30,000 ducats over three years.\"\n\n\"The route from Naples to Salerno and the southern coast—important for connecting the capital to the grain-producing regions and the southern ports. Another sixty miles. Perhaps 20,000 ducats.\"\n\n\"The route from Benevento to Bari and the Adriatic—essential if you wish to move goods or troops to the eastern coast without relying on the long sea passage around the heel of Italy. A hundred miles through difficult country. Perhaps 40,000 ducats, maybe more—the bridges in the Apennine passes are in terrible condition.\"\n\nHe spreads his hands.\n\n\"Prioritize those three routes—90,000 to 100,000 ducats over five to seven years—and you have connected your capital to Rome, to the southern grain lands, and to the Adriatic. The rest can wait. The lesser routes, the mountain tracks, the connections between small towns—those benefit local barons and local peasants, but they do not transform the kingdom's commerce.\"\n\nHe is quiet for a moment.\n\n\"Alfonso never attempted this. Not because he lacked the money—in his best years, he could have afforded it. But because roads do not win wars. Ships win wars. Soldiers win wars. Alfonso was always preparing for the next campaign, the next conquest, the next expansion of Aragonese power in Italy.\"\n\n\"He built fortresses. He built galleys. He hired mercenaries. He did not build roads.\"\n\nA pause.\n\n\"Perhaps that is why, after ten years of rule, the interior of this kingdom is no more prosperous than when he arrived.\"\n\nHe looks at you with an expression that has shifted over the course of this conversation—from wariness, to surprise, to something that might be the beginning of genuine respect.\n\n\"You are asking questions no king of Naples has asked in living memory. Roads. Ports. Investment. The return on infrastructure.\" He shakes his head slowly. \"The barons outside that door expect you to ask about loyalty, about rewards, about which of them you will favor and which you will punish.\"\n\n\"Instead you are asking how to make the kingdom work.\"\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\"May I ask you a question in return, Your Majesty?\"",

The closest equivalent would be a parliament or assembly of the estates - the barons, the clergy, and perhaps representatives of the major cities. But it's not institutionalized in the same way as the Aragonese Cortes.\n\nI should have the Prince of Taranto clarify this - or perhaps Juan's advisors. Naples is a feudal kingdom with a more autocratic structure on paper, but in practice the barons have enormous power. There might be a general assembly or parliament that can be summoned, but it's not the same formal institution.\n\nLet me search for information about Neapolitan political institutions in the 15th century to be accurate here.\n\nActually, I should just proceed narratively. The Prince would likely explain that Naples doesn't have a Cortes per se, but the king can summon a general parliament or assembly of the estates if he wishes. This would be unusual - kings of Naples typically rule more directly, consulting with individual barons or small councils rather than formal assemblies.\n\nBut if Juan wants to present something to the assembled estates - like his proposed reforms - he could summon such an assembly. It would be noted as unusual, perhaps even concerning to some barons (why does this king want to address us all at once?), but it's within his rights.\n\nLet me proceed with this.\n\nThe Prince of Taranto blinks.\n\n\"The Cortes, Your Majesty?\"\n\nHe hesitates, choosing his words carefully.\n\n\"Forgive me—Naples does not have a Cortes.

When Alfonso wished to consult the barons, he summoned those he chose to summon, individually or in small groups. When he needed a donativo, he sent requests to each lord separately, or gathered the greatest among us to hear his demands. When he wished to address the cities, he dealt with each city's representatives on their own terms.\"\n\nHe pauses, studying your face.\n\n\"You could summon a general parliament. It is within your rights—kings have done so before, in times of great crisis or great undertaking. The barons would attend; they would not dare refuse a royal summons. The bishops would come. The cities would send representatives.\"\n\n\"But it would be... unusual. It would signal that something significant is happening. The barons would arrive nervous, wondering what you intend. Some would suspect a trap—gather everyone together, then announce confiscations or arrests. Others would see opportunity—a chance to present grievances, to extract concessions while they have strength in numbers.\"\n\nHe rubs his chin thoughtfully.\n\n\"What is it you wish to propose to them, Your Majesty?

And no one can organize resistance in advance if they do not know what you will say until you say it.\"\n\nHe bows his head slightly.\n\n\"I will see to it, Your Majesty. The Archbishop of Naples will perform the unction—he has been preparing since word came of Alfonso's death. The barons are already here or arriving daily. I will send word to the cities that their representatives are expected. Give me three days to ensure all is in order.\"\n\nThree Days Later\n\nDecember 1437\n\nThe Cathedral of San Gennaro rises above Naples like a prayer carved in stone. Within its ancient walls, the blood of the city's patron saint is said to liquefy three times each year—a miracle the Neapolitans guard jealously, proof that heaven watches over their city.\n\nToday the cathedral will witness another kind of transformation: a Castilian king becoming a Neapolitan one.\n\nYou have spent the three days wisely. Diego de Daza has worked without sleep, gathering what records exist of Neapolitan revenues and administration. The Prince of Taranto has proven an invaluable guide, explaining which barons matter, which bishops hold real influence, which cities carry weight beyond their size. Queen María sent letters of introduction to those who served her husband, smoothing your path with the authority of Alfonso's widow.\n\nThe papal investiture arrived yesterday—a formal bull from Eugenius IV confirming your right to the throne of Naples as Alfonso's legitimate heir and faithful son of the Church. The Pope's support is unambiguous; the document praises your crusading zeal, your defense of Christendom, your devotion to Holy Mother Church. It is everything you could have wished.\n\nNow you stand in the sacristy of San Gennaro, robed for coronation. Through the heavy doors, you hear the cathedral filling with voices—hundreds of them, perhaps over a thousand. The Prince of Taranto has done his work well.\n\nDiego de Daza reviews the assembly one final time, reading from notes:\n\n\"The clergy: Archbishop Rinaldo Piscicelli of Naples presides. Beside him, the Archbishops of Capua and Salerno, the Bishops of Aversa, Gaeta, Nola, Benevento, and a dozen others. The major abbots—Montecassino sent their prior, as did the Benedictines of Cava. The mendicant orders are represented: Franciscans, Dominicans, Augustinians.\"\n\nHe turns a page.\n\n\"The nobility: the Prince of Taranto you know. Giovanni Antonio Orsini, Prince of Taranto, the most powerful lord in the realm. Raimondo del Balzo, Duke of Andria. The Sanseverino clan—three brothers, each commanding significant forces. The Caracciolo in strength: Sergianni who met you at sea, and his cousins. The Ruffo of Calabria. The Acquaviva of the Abruzzi. Smaller lords beyond counting. I estimate sixty to eighty baronial families represented, either in person or by heir.\"\n\nAnother page.\n\n\"The cities: Naples itself sends twelve representatives—the sedili, the noble seats that govern the city, plus the guilds. Gaeta, Salerno, Capua, Aversa, Sorrento, Amalfi—all have sent delegations. The Adriatic cities: Bari, Taranto, Brindisi, Trani. Even Reggio in the far south. Perhaps forty cities represented in total.\"\n\nHe looks up.\n\n\"It is the largest assembly Naples has seen since Alfonso's own coronation. Perhaps larger.\"\n\nA knock at the sacristy door. A priest enters, bowing.\n\n\"Your Majesty, the Archbishop is ready. The assembly awaits.\"\n\nThe doors swing open.\n\nThe nave of San Gennaro stretches before you, a river of faces beneath soaring Gothic vaults. Candles burn by the hundreds, their light catching gold thread and polished steel, episcopal mitres and baronial coronets. The air is thick with incense and anticipation.\n\nThe clergy fill the choir and the spaces nearest the altar—a sea of white and purple and the black of monastic habits. To the right, the nobility: silk and velvet and the glint of swords worn even in church, proud faces watching your every step. To the left, the cities' representatives: wealthy merchants in fine wool, guild masters, civic officials—less magnificent than the nobles, but no less attentive.\n\nArchbishop Piscicelli stands at the high altar, ancient and frail but steady in his vestments. Beside him, on a cushion of crimson velvet, rests the crown of Naples.\n\nYou walk the length of the nave alone, as you did in Zaragoza. The silence is absolute save for your footsteps on stone.\n\nAt the altar, you kneel.\n\nThe ceremony unfolds as ceremonies do—ancient words, holy oil, the weight of metal settling onto your brow. The Archbishop's voice carries through the cathedral: prayers in Latin, blessings, invocations of saints and angels. The blood of San Gennaro, housed in its reliquary nearby, seems almost to glow in the candlelight.\n\nWhen the crown touches your head, a sound rises from the assembly—not the structured acclamation of Aragón, but something rawer: \"Viva il Re! Viva il Re!\" The Neapolitans have had too many kings and too much chaos; they cheer because they hope, not because tradition demands it.\n\nYou rise, crowned, and turn to face the assembly.\n\nThe cathedral falls silent.\n\nThey are all watching—clergy, nobility, cities. The Prince of Taranto stands near the front of the noble section, his face carefully neutral. The Archbishop waits beside you, uncertain whether the ceremony is complete or whether something more is coming.\n\nThis is the moment. A coronation speech is traditional—expected, even. But what a new king says at his coronation is remembered. Recorded. Repeated.\n\nThe assembly of Naples awaits your words.",

      "text": "(GM: Juan is a true polyglot and I speak Italian fluently, trained by speaking with my wife Lucia often)\n\n\nMy fellow christians,\n\n\nI accept humbly the obligations the crown places on me. I have always wanted to not only rule but to also make the lands that fall under my rule more prosperous, more just and better. And I will adress how I want to do this later.\n\n\nBut first let me adress the most important issue facing christians in this age. The downfall of the cross in the east. We have been driven from the holy lands and now the last christian city in the east stands alone. Alone? It stands alone no longer. I have accepted the duty as christian to defend the lands of christianity no matter the danger. I have promised to take the fight to the Ottomans or die trying.\n\n\nThis is not only our greatest challenge but also our greatest opportunity. Those supplying troops freely are counted in the muster every campain season and can claim titles and estates in turn. I hope the Neaponese will join me in this fight and I make sure that this is no obligation at all. It is an opportunity.\n\n\nNow turning away from religious matters, I turn to our lands and how to improve it. I admire the proud Roman heritage this kingdom carries. It saddens me therefore to see so many Roman bridges and roads in a state of disrepair. I will therefore start a road and pridge building program of at least 70.000 florins. Better roads means safer roads. And more and safer roads means more trade and prosperity. It will provide honest work for those with hands willing to take up the pickaxe and shovel.\n\n\nBut our true strength lies in the seas that has given us so much. I will spend at least 50.000 florins to make sure the ports are in good shape and can recieve trade ships and transports. In addition, I will institute mercantile courts to uphold the lex mercantile. These same laws and courts will be implemented in all the lands under my protection. This system will not give undue advantage to anyone but instead security to all.\n\n\nLands and titles for the nobles willing to fight. Churches in the aid and help for our christians in the east. And investment in ports and roads to promote trade. I hope that this will satisfy the lord as I now take this crown and be your king.\n\n\nI let a small pause fall.\n\n\nThere is one more thing. These lands have suffered greatly in the past years. In order for the lands to recover, I now declare that all taxes owed to the rule of my cousin king Alfonso are now forgiven. We start with a clean slate. A new king, a new start.\n\n\nNot only that, I also declare that all nobles holding lands under feudum contract shall only have to pay half of the full amount owed under their contract. I expect the nobles to use the funds that now are not owed to the crown to do as I am; to improve their lands. Clear paths, dig wells, repair roads and hedges.\n\n\nBuild this kingdom with me.\n\n\nThis is a persuasion. Draft a d100 table using the skill.",

      "text": "**The Ask:**\nJuan is making multiple offers to the assembled estates of Naples at his coronation:\n1. Voluntary crusade participation with titles/estates as rewards (to nobility)\n2. Road and bridge building program (70,000 florins)\n3. Port improvements (50,000 florins)\n4. Mercantile courts with lex mercantile\n5. Forgiveness of all back taxes owed under Alfonso\n6. 50% reduction in focatico payments for nobles holding feudum contracts, with expectation they invest in their lands\n\n**Evaluating the Approach:**\n- Juan speaks in fluent Italian - culturally appropriate\n- He addresses religious concerns first (crusade) - appropriate for a coronation ceremony\n- He presents the crusade as opportunity, not obligation - smart framing\n- He offers concrete investments (roads, ports) - shows commitment\n- He announces tax forgiveness and reduction - major concession\n- He frames the tax reduction as expecting nobles to invest in their lands - gives them dignity while potentially increasing kingdom's prosperity\n- He asks them to \"build this kingdom with me\" - partnership language\n\n**Success Factors:**\n1. Juan's reputation precedes him - conqueror of Granada, defender of Constantinople\n2. Papal support explicitly confirmed - legitimacy unquestionable\n3. Tax forgiveness removes the sword of Alfonso's dossiers hanging over barons\n4. 50% reduction in current taxes - immediate material benefit\n5. Road and port investment benefits everyone (though ports benefit merchants more)\n6. Crusade presented as opportunity, not obligation - titles and estates available\n7. Mercantile courts benefit trade - merchants should like this\n8. Juan speaks fluent Italian - respect for local culture\n9. Prince of Taranto has been won over during private conversations\n10. Alfonso V already established Aragonese rule - this is succession, not conquest\n11. The speech offers something to everyone: nobles get tax relief and crusade opportunities, clergy get churches in the East, merchants get ports and trade courts, cities get infrastructure\n \nI see potential risks that could undermine Juan's persuasive strategy. His foreign status creates inherent challenges, with skeptical nobles potentially viewing his proposals as manipulative. The tax reduction might seem insufficient, and the expectation of reinvestment could be perceived as controlling. Unequal infrastructure investments between coastal and interior regions might breed resentment. The lack of explicit details about the census amnesty plan could further erode trust. These nuanced political dynamics require careful navigation to prevent potential backlash.\n\nKey concerns include the public nature of the speech limiting private negotiation, potential loss of nobles' bargaining leverage, and uncertainty about how city charters fit into the proposed changes. Some groups, like clergy and deeply suspicious nobles like Juan de Híjar, might view the initiative with significant distrust. The proposal's vagueness could trigger more anxiety than cooperation, making the seemingly generous offer potentially counterproductive.\n\nDespite risks, the strategic approach offers concrete benefits - tax relief, respectful communication, and voluntary participation - which should generate broadly positive reception. The implicit rather than explicit ask creates space for goodwill without demanding immediate specific commitments.\n\nCoronation Address - Persuasion Resolution\n\nStep 1: Identify the Ask\n\nJuan is making a multi-layered address to the assembled estates of Naples at his coronation. The asks are:\n\nTo the Nobility: Accept me as king; consider voluntary crusade participation for titles and estates\n\nTo the Clergy: Support the crusade; accept the promise of churches in the East\n\nTo the Cities/Merchants: Welcome port investment and mercantile courts\n\nTo Everyone: Accept tax amnesty and reduced payments; invest alongside the crown in building the kingdom\n\nThis is less a specific demand than a declaration of intent, asking for acceptance and goodwill rather than immediate commitments.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate the Approach\n\nArgument Quality:\n\nOpens with humility (\"accept humbly the obligations\")\n\nLeads with religious duty—appropriate for coronation, establishes shared Christian identity\n\nCrusade framed as opportunity not obligation—clever, removes coercive element\n\nInfrastructure investment is concrete, specific, substantial (120,000 florins total)\n\nMercantile courts benefit trade—merchants should appreciate standardization\n\nTax amnesty removes the sword hanging over every baron's head\n\n50% reduction is generous—more than they expected\n\n\"Build this kingdom with me\" frames relationship as partnership\n\nCultural Appropriateness:\n\nJuan speaks fluent Italian—respect for local culture\n\nAddresses religious matters first—proper priority for medieval ceremony\n\nOffers concrete benefits before asking anything—generous sequencing\n\nFrames noble tax reduction as trusting them to improve their lands—gives dignity\n\nConcerns Addressed:\n\nBarons feared dossiers and back-tax claims—amnesty addresses this directly\n\nMerchants feared Castilian dominance—mercantile courts offer standardization without subjugation\n\nEveryone wondered what kind of king Juan would be—this answers clearly\n\nPotential Weaknesses:\n\nThe implicit quid pro quo (amnesty now, accurate census later) is not stated\n\n\"Expectation\" that nobles invest savings is vague—obligation or hope?\n\nCities' ancient charter payments—are they included in amnesty? Unclear\n\nSome may find it \"too good\"—what's the catch?\n\nStep 3: Identify All Factors\n\nSuccess Factors:\n\nReputation: Juan conquered Granada, defended Constantinople, kept faith with former enemies—his word means something\n\nPapal Support: Eugenius IV's bull explicitly confirms legitimacy—religious authority behind him\n\nTax Amnesty: Removes the accumulated threat of Alfonso's dossiers—barons breathe easier\n\n50% Reduction: Immediate, tangible benefit exceeding expectations\n\nInfrastructure Investment: 120,000 florins is substantial—shows commitment to kingdom, not extraction\n\nVoluntary Crusade: Opportunity for glory and estates without compulsion—appeals to ambitious nobles\n\nMercantile Courts: Standardized trade law benefits merchants—practical improvement\n\nPrince of Taranto's Private Conversations: The most powerful baron has already been engaged and seems favorable\n\nFluent Italian: Cultural respect demonstrated\n\nPartnership Language: \"Build this kingdom with me\" rather than \"obey your king\"\n\nSomething for Everyone: Nobles get tax relief and crusade opportunity; clergy get Eastern churches; merchants get ports and courts; cities get roads\n\nFailure Factors:\n\nForeign King: Juan is Castilian—suspicion of outsider rule persists regardless of speech\n\nToo Good to Be True: Generous offers may increase suspicion—what's the catch?\n\nImplicit Future Census: The amnesty-for-accuracy trade hasn't been explained—some may sense a trap\n\nVague \"Expectation\": Nobles told to invest savings in their lands—is this request or requirement?\n\nCharter Ambiguity: Cities' ancient fixed payments—are they forgiven? Renegotiated? Unclear\n\nPublic Setting: Those with objections cannot negotiate privately—must accept or openly dissent\n\nLoss of Leverage (for nobles): If dossiers destroyed, nobles lose future bargaining chips\n\nDistribution Concerns: Roads benefit interior barons; ports benefit coastal merchants—each may feel other got better deal\n\nHardened Skeptics: Don Juan de Híjar types who will suspect any royal initiative regardless of content\n\nPrecedent Fear: If this king can forgive taxes, can the next king un-forgive them?\n\nStep 4: Assess the Factor Balance\n\nThe success factors significantly outweigh the failure factors. Juan offers concrete, immediate benefits while asking for nothing specific in return. The failure factors are largely potential concerns and suspicions rather than actual costs being imposed.\n\nHowever, this is Naples—a kingdom of suspicious barons who have learned through generations that royal promises are temporary and royal generosity has hidden prices. Even an excellent offer will be received with caution.\n\nThe speech should succeed in generating broadly positive reception, but the degree of enthusiasm and trust will vary. Some will be genuinely moved; others will wait to see if actions match words; a few will remain hostile regardless.\n\nStep 5: Construct the D100 Table\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-5\nHostile Suspicion Crystallizes. Your generosity backfires catastrophically. Someone—perhaps a baron, perhaps a city representative—rises to publicly question the offer. \"What does the Castilian want in exchange? What trap lies beneath these honeyed words?\" Others murmur agreement. The ceremony concludes in awkward tension. Your reign begins under a cloud of organized suspicion, and the skeptics begin coordinating their resistance before you've left the cathedral.\n6-15\nPolite Skepticism. The assembly receives your words with correct formality but visible reserve. Applause is thin. Faces remain guarded. The tax amnesty draws some interest, but whispered conversations suggest most are waiting to see the catch. You are crowned and accepted, but you have convinced no one. The barons will watch, and wait, and test you at the first opportunity.\n16-25\nDivided Reception. Your offers land unevenly. The merchants respond well to port investment and mercantile courts—concrete benefits they understand. The clergy appreciate the crusade framing. But the nobility remains stone-faced, tax amnesty notwithstanding. Don Juan de Híjar types exchange knowing glances. You've won the cities and Church, but the barons require more proof.\n26-40\nCautious Acceptance. The assembly responds with measured approval. The tax amnesty generates genuine relief—you see shoulders relax, expressions soften. But the enthusiasm is muted. They've heard royal promises before. They will accept your reign and give you a chance to prove yourself, but trust must be earned through deeds, not speeches. A foundation, not a triumph.\n41-55\nSolid Reception. Your words land well. The combination of concrete investment, tax relief, and respectful tone creates genuine positive impression. The Prince of Taranto leads applause that others join willingly. The merchants confer among themselves with evident interest. Even skeptical barons acknowledge—privately—that this is more than they expected. You have bought yourself goodwill and time.\n56-70\nWarm Welcome. The cathedral fills with increasingly genuine acclamation. Your fluent Italian, your respect for Neapolitan pride, your substantial investments—they add up to something the assembly did not expect from a foreign conqueror. The tax amnesty draws audible gasps of relief. The 50% reduction produces actual cheers from the noble section. You see faces shifting from wariness to hope.\n71-85\nEnthusiastic Endorsement. The speech strikes exactly the right notes. When you announce the tax amnesty, a wave of relief passes through the noble ranks—visible, palpable. When you add the 50% reduction, the response approaches jubilation. The merchants stamp their feet at the mention of mercantile courts. The clergy nod approvingly at your crusading vision. Even Don Juan de Híjar cannot openly dissent against such generosity. You leave the cathedral with genuine momentum.\n86-95\n\"Un Re Napoletano.\" Your address transcends mere acceptance. The combination of generosity, respect, and partnership transforms the room. The Prince of Taranto rises first, calling for three cheers—and the assembly means them. Barons who entered suspicious leave speaking of opportunity. Merchants who feared Castilian dominance speak instead of collaboration. The clergy praise your piety. Stories of this coronation will spread throughout Italy: the foreign king who came not to extract but to build.\n96-100\nThe Bonds of Naples. Something extraordinary happens—the kind of moment that reshapes political reality. Your words, your evident sincerity, your concrete generosity break through generations of Neapolitan cynicism. When you finish speaking, the Prince of Taranto rises—and then, one by one, other great lords stand with him. Someone begins the old Neapolitan oath of fealty, and others take it up. The ceremony transforms from acceptance to acclamation. Before you leave San Gennaro, delegations from all three estates approach with offers of concrete support. The barons propose an immediate donativo—voluntary—to fund your road program. The merchants offer to match crown investment in the ports. The clergy pledge prayers and processions throughout the realm. You have not merely been accepted as King of Naples. You have been claimed.\n\nFailure Factor Persistence\n\nEven on the highest rolls:\n\nJuan remains Castilian—some will always see him as foreign\n\nThe implicit census quid pro quo remains unexplained—questions will arise later\n\nDon Juan de Híjar types will comply but not convert—they will watch for betrayal\n\nThe cities' charter ambiguity needs resolution—representatives will seek clarification\n\nGenerosity creates expectations—future requests will be measured against this standard\n\nWhen you're ready, roll the d100.",

      "text": "With a roll of 70, we're in the \"Warm Welcome\" range (56-70). This is a solidly positive outcome - genuine enthusiasm, relief at the tax measures, shifting from wariness to hope. Not the extraordinary transformation of the highest rolls, but a real success.\n\nLet me narrate this outcome, keeping in mind:\n- The tax amnesty for back taxes is complete (all owed under Alfonso forgiven)\n- The 50% reduction is for THREE YEARS only\n- The infrastructure investment is substantial (70,000 for roads, 50,000 for ports)\n- The crusade is voluntary with opportunity for titles/estates\n- Mercantile courts will be established\n- Juan speaks fluent Italian\n\nI need to show:\n- Genuine positive reception\n- Relief at the tax measures\n- Faces shifting from wariness to hope\n- Some remaining caution (failure factors persist)\n- The Prince of Taranto's reaction\n- Different estates responding to different parts of the speech\n\nLet me write this scene.\n\nThe cathedral holds its breath as you speak.\n\nYour Italian flows without hesitation—not the stilted phrases of a foreign king reading from prepared text, but the living language of a man who has spoken it in private chambers, in intimate conversation, until it became part of him. The Neapolitans notice. Of course they notice. They have heard Angevin French and Aragonese Catalan from their rulers; they have rarely heard their own tongue spoken back to them with such fluency.\n\nWhen you speak of the crusade, of Constantinople standing alone no longer, the clergy lean forward. Archbishop Piscicelli's aged face softens. This is language they understand—the language of holy war, of Christian duty, of the cross carried eastward. And when you make clear that participation brings opportunity rather than obligation, you see calculating looks replace pious ones among the nobility. Titles. Estates. Glory won in distant lands rather than fought over in endless Italian feuds.\n\nThe infrastructure announcement draws murmurs. Seventy thousand florins for roads and bridges. Fifty thousand for ports. These are not vague promises—these are numbers, specific and substantial. The merchants exchange glances. The mention of mercantile courts, of standardized law across all your realms, produces visible interest from the city delegations. Lex mercatoria enforced consistently from Castile to Naples means contracts honored, disputes resolved, trade flowing without the chaos of competing jurisdictions.\n\nBut it is the tax declaration that transforms the room.\n\n\"All taxes owed under the rule of my cousin King Alfonso are now forgiven.\"\n\nA ripple passes through the noble ranks—not sound, but motion. Men shifting in their seats. Hands gripping armrests. You have just burned the dossiers. Every baron in this cathedral has lived for years under the accumulated weight of documented arrears, of royal commissioners tallying debts that could be called in at any moment. That sword has hung over their heads through Alfonso's reign and into the uncertain days after his death.\n\nYou have just removed it.\n\n\"All nobles holding lands under feudum contract shall only have to pay half of the full amount owed for the coming three years.\"\n\nNow there is sound—a collective exhalation, whispered conversations breaking out despite the sacred setting. Three years of half-payment. Three years to recover from Alfonso's wars, from the chaos of succession, from the accumulated strain of a kingdom squeezed for Italian adventures. And your expectation—stated clearly but without threat—that they use those savings to improve their own lands.\n\nYou see the Prince of Taranto nodding slowly, his weathered face showing something that might be satisfaction. He tested you in that antechamber. You passed.\n\n\"Build this kingdom with me.\"\n\nThe silence after you finish lasts perhaps three heartbeats.\n\nThen the Prince of Taranto rises. The most powerful baron in Naples, the man whose support or opposition can make or break a reign, stands and begins to applaud. The sound echoes sharply in the stone vault of the cathedral.\n\nOthers follow. Sergianni Caracciolo, who met you at sea. Raimondo del Balzo. The Sanseverino brothers, rising as one. The applause spreads through the noble section like fire through dry grass—not the polite acknowledgment of a formal occasion, but something with genuine feeling behind it.\n\nThe merchants join more cautiously, but they join. The port investment, the mercantile courts—these speak to their interests directly. Berenguer de Montcada's Neapolitan counterparts see opportunity where they expected extraction.\n\nThe clergy add their voices last, as befits their dignity, but Archbishop Piscicelli's thin applause carries the weight of ecclesiastical approval. The crusade. The churches in the East. A king who speaks of Christian duty and seems to mean it.\n\nYou watch the faces as the acclamation continues. Most show relief, hope, the cautious optimism of people who have learned not to trust but find themselves wanting to trust anyway. The tax amnesty has bought you enormous goodwill. The infrastructure investment has demonstrated that you see Naples as something to build, not merely to drain.\n\nBut not every face has softened.\n\nNear the back of the noble section, you spot a cluster of men who applaud with mechanical correctness and nothing more. Don Juan de Híjar—you recognize him from the Prince of Taranto's descriptions—watches you with eyes that calculate rather than welcome. His hands move, but his expression says: We shall see, Castilian. We shall see.\n\nAnd among the city delegations, you notice representatives conferring urgently. The tax amnesty was clear for the nobility. But what of the cities' ancient charter payments? Are those forgiven as well? Reduced? The ambiguity has not escaped them.\n\nThese are problems for tomorrow. Today, you have achieved something real.\n\nAs the applause finally fades, the Archbishop steps forward to conclude the ceremony with final blessings. But before he speaks, the Prince of Taranto's voice cuts through the settling quiet:\n\n\"Your Majesty has spoken of building this kingdom together. The nobility of Naples hears this, and we answer.\"\n\nHe pauses, looking around at his fellow barons, some of whom seem surprised by this unscripted addition.\n\n\"The roads Your Majesty proposes will cross our lands. We cannot in honor allow our king to bear this burden alone while we pocket the savings he has granted us. I propose—\" he glances at the other great lords, \"—that those of us whose lands will benefit from improved roads contribute labor and materials to speed the work. Not as tax, not as obligation, but as partnership. As Your Majesty has offered partnership to us.\"\n\nMurmurs of agreement from some quarters. Calculating silence from others. The Prince has not committed anyone but himself—but he has opened a door.\n\nThe Archbishop clears his throat, eager to restore liturgical order. The final blessings are pronounced. The ceremony concludes.\n\nYou descend from the altar as King of Naples in truth as well as name. The assembly begins to break into smaller groups, conversations erupting throughout the cathedral as men digest what they have heard and begin to calculate what it means for them.\n\nThe Prince of Taranto appears at your side.\n\n\"Well done, Your Majesty,\" he says quietly, beneath the noise. \"The amnesty was inspired. Half of them walked in here wondering when you would call in Alfonso's debts. Now they wonder what else you might do that defies their expectations.\"\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\"The city representatives will want clarification on their charter payments. And Don Juan de Híjar is already whispering to his allies—I saw him. He will look for reasons to doubt you, no matter what you offer.\"\n\nHis eyes meet yours.\n\n\"But today? Today was a victory. What would Your Majesty do with it?\"",

Now I need to have Diego respond to Juan's request for a 1437 budget that incorporates:\n1. Constantinople (already in the 1436 budget)\n2. Aragon (new - needs integration)\n3.

Let me have Diego ask the relevant questions based on what we learned from the Prince of Taranto about Naples, and what we know about Aragon from the previous chapter.\n\nKey questions Diego would need to ask:\n1. Aragon revenues - what are the actual numbers? (Chapter 2.42 mentioned 100,000-120,000 florins annually)\n2. Naples revenues - what are the actual numbers?

The Neapolitan servants have provided him a small writing desk in an antechamber adjoining your apartments, and he has clearly not been idle during the coronation preparations.\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" he says, bowing. He accepts the reference document—the 1436 budget—and studies it briefly, though his expression suggests he has the figures largely memorized already.\n\n\"A unified budget for 1437 across three crowns, plus Constantinople and the African ventures.\" He pulls out a sheaf of notes. \"I have been gathering what information I can since we arrived, but Your Majesty is correct—I have many questions before I can draft anything reliable.\"\n\nHe settles into a chair across from you, quill ready.\n\n\"Let me organize my questions by realm, Your Majesty.\"\n\n\"First, the existing treasuries.\"\n\n\"When Your Majesty inherited Aragon and Naples, there should have been existing treasury reserves from King Alfonso's administration. Do we know what those amounts were? Alfonso was not known for frugality, but even so, there may have been something. And conversely—were there outstanding debts we have inherited? Loans from Florentine or Genoese bankers, perhaps?\"\n\n\"Second, Aragon.\"\n\n\"Queen María mentioned revenues of approximately 100,000 to 120,000 florins annually. But she also noted that much of the royal patrimony was mortgaged from Alfonso's Italian wars. Do we have any clearer picture of what the crown actually receives versus what is theoretically owed? And what annual expenses does the Aragonese crown bear—royal household in Zaragoza, administration, any standing military commitments?\"\n\n\"Also—the three new Books of Fueros Your Majesty negotiated. The Sacred Treasury of the Crusade, the registry system, the voluntary muster. Do any of these create new expenses for 1437? Will the Archbishop's petition to Rome require funds? Will the registry require clerks and officials?\"\n\n\"Third, Naples.\"\n\n\"The Prince of Taranto gave Your Majesty excellent information about theoretical versus actual revenues. He mentioned approximately 275,000 ducats in ordinary revenue—80,000 from the focatico, 100,000 from customs, 30,000 from salt, and various smaller sources. But I must ask: are Neapolitan ducats equivalent to Florentine florins? I believe they are close, but for accurate accounting I need to know the exchange.\"\n\n\"More pressing: Your Majesty has just announced significant commitments.\"\n\nHe counts on his fingers:\n\n\"Seventy thousand florins for roads and bridges. Fifty thousand for ports. That is 120,000 in infrastructure investment—over how many years? Is this a single year's commitment or spread across multiple years?\"\n\n\"The tax amnesty—all arrears from Alfonso's reign forgiven. This costs us nothing in immediate cash, but it eliminates potential revenue we might have collected by pressing those claims.\"\n\n\"The three-year reduction—nobles pay only half their focatico obligations. If the nobility's share of the focatico is perhaps 40,000 to 50,000 ducats of the 80,000 collected, then half of that is 20,000 to 25,000 ducats in forgone revenue annually. For three years, that is 60,000 to 75,000 in total revenue we will not collect.\"\n\n\"And what of Naples' existing expenses? Emperor John VIII's pension is paid from Constantinople's accounts, but what does the Neapolitan crown itself spend on administration, royal household, garrisons, fleet?\"\n\n\"Fourth, Constantinople.\"\n\n\"The 1436 budget shows Constantinople revenues of 7,900 florins and projects growth to 12,000 in 1437. Are we still confident in these projections? The settlement convoys continue, yes? And the wall repairs—are we maintaining the 20,000 florin annual commitment, or has the work progressed enough to reduce that figure?\"\n\n\"Fifth, currency and accounting.\"\n\n\"We now operate in three currencies: Castilian maravedís, Aragonese sous and florins, and Neapolitan ducats. For the unified budget, should I convert everything to Florentine florins as our standard unit? And what exchange rates should I use?\"\n\n\"Sixth, new administrative costs.\"\n\n\"Ruling three kingdoms will require expanded administration. Will Your Majesty maintain separate royal households in Toledo, Zaragoza, and Naples? Or will the court travel? Will we need viceroys or governors for the realms where Your Majesty is not present? What about expanded diplomatic costs—we now have interests across the Mediterranean that require representation?\"\n\nHe looks up from his notes.\n\n\"Forgive the barrage of questions, Your Majesty. But a budget built on assumptions is worse than no budget at all. Once I have these answers, I can draft something accurate.\"\n\n\"Is there anything else Your Majesty has committed to that I should know about? Any promises made in Zaragoza or here in Naples that carry financial implications?\"",

The financial landscape appears complex, with wide-ranging potential treasury outcomes.\n\nI have gathered substantial historical data. Let me now compile my findings and construct the d100 table for Alfonso's treasury.\n\nHistorical Research Summary: Diego's Findings\n\nDiego spends two days consulting with Neapolitan treasury officials, reviewing what records survived Alfonso's administration, and corresponding with agents in Barcelona. He returns with a comprehensive report.\n\nKingdom of Naples - Baseline Figures\n\n\"Your Majesty, I have confirmed the Prince of Taranto's estimates against the treasury records.\"\n\nPopulation: Census records show approximately 220,000-230,000 hearths in the kingdom (excluding the city of Naples itself, which has perhaps 40,000-50,000 more). The population has been slowly recovering from the great plagues but remains far below its peak before the Black Death.\n\nTheoretical Revenues:\n\nFocatico (hearth tax): At one ducat per hearth, theoretical yield is 250,000-280,000 ducats\n\nCustoms (dohana): Theoretical 150,000 ducats from all ports\n\nSalt monopoly (gabella del sale): Theoretical 40,000 ducats\n\nJudicial revenues: Perhaps 20,000 ducats\n\nFeudal incidents: Variable, 10,000-50,000 ducats depending on deaths\n\nRoyal domain: Perhaps 30,000 ducats from remaining crown lands\n\nActual Collection under Alfonso:\n\nFocatico actually collected: 75,000-85,000 ducats (approximately one-third of theoretical)\n\nCustoms actually collected: 95,000-105,000 ducats\n\nSalt: 28,000-32,000 ducats\n\nOther sources: 40,000-50,000 ducats combined\n\n\"King Alfonso, in his best years, collected approximately 250,000-280,000 ducats annually from Naples. This is consistent with what the Prince told Your Majesty.\"\n\nCurrency Note: \"The Neapolitan ducat and the Florentine florin are virtually identical—both contain approximately 3.5 grams of fine gold. For accounting purposes, I will treat them as equivalent. The Aragonese florin is likewise comparable.\"\n\nCrown of Aragon - Baseline Figures\n\n\"The Crown of Aragon is more complex. It comprises three separate realms—Aragon proper, Catalonia, and Valencia—each with its own Cortes and tax structure.\"\n\nPopulation:\n\nKingdom of Aragon: Perhaps 200,000-250,000 people\n\nPrincipality of Catalonia: Perhaps 300,000-350,000 people\n\nKingdom of Valencia: Perhaps 200,000-250,000 people\n\nKingdom of Majorca (Balearics): Perhaps 50,000 people\n\nCrown Revenues:\nQueen María's estimate of 100,000-120,000 florins annually for the combined Crown of Aragon appears accurate, but with critical caveats:\n\nThe royal patrimony is heavily mortgaged from Alfonso's Italian wars\n\nThe Diputació controls Cortes-granted subsidies—the crown never touches that money directly\n\nMuch revenue remains theoretical due to collection inefficiencies\n\nCities retain customary shares of royal customs\n\n\"The Crown of Aragon's revenues are perhaps one-quarter to one-third of Castile's, despite similar total population. This reflects the constitutional limits Your Majesty observed during the coronation—the fueros genuinely constrain royal taxation.\"\n\nOngoing Expenses Inherited\n\nNaples:\n\nRoyal household in Castel Nuovo: 25,000-30,000 ducats annually\n\nGarrisons (coastal fortresses, key cities): 15,000-20,000 ducats\n\nFleet maintenance: 20,000-25,000 ducats\n\nAdministration (treasury, chancery, courts): 15,000-20,000 ducats\n\nDiplomatic missions and subsidies (Balkans, etc.): 10,000-15,000 ducats\n\nAragon:\n\nRoyal household in Zaragoza: 8,000-12,000 florins\n\nAdministration across three realms: 10,000-15,000 florins\n\nVarious traditional obligations: 5,000-8,000 florins\n\nAlfonso's Treasury at Death - The Unknown\n\nDiego sets down his papers.\n\n\"This is where certainty ends, Your Majesty. King Alfonso was renowned as both a capable administrator and a lavish spender. He patronized humanist scholars, maintained a magnificent court, funded diplomatic initiatives across the Mediterranean, subsidized Christian lords in the Balkans, and built extensively in Naples—including the famous triumphal arch.\"\n\n\"The treasury records are incomplete. Alfonso's personal accountants died with him or scattered. What remains shows substantial revenues but also substantial expenditure. The question is: what balance remained at his death?\"\n\nD100 Table: Alfonso V's Remaining Treasury\n\nFactors Suggesting a Larger Treasury\n\nPeaceful final years: In our timeline, Alfonso ruled Naples without major Italian wars in his last years—the conquest was complete, René of Anjou defeated\n\nEnthusiastic succession (Roll 99): The Neapolitan barons' immediate declaration suggests a stable, functioning administration\n\nEffective administrator: When not at war, Alfonso maintained efficient tax collection\n\nNo major campaigns: No indication of expensive military expeditions in 1436-1437\n\nThree-year tax collection: Several years of relatively peaceful revenue collection before death\n\nFactors Suggesting a Smaller Treasury\n\nRenaissance extravagance: Alfonso's patronage of arts, scholars, and building projects was legendary\n\nBalkan subsidies: Ongoing payments to Skanderbeg, Stefan Vukčić, and other Christian lords\n\nFleet maintenance: The Neapolitan-Aragonese fleet required constant investment\n\nMortgaged patrimony: María confirmed the royal estates were heavily mortgaged from the conquest wars\n\nDiplomatic gifts: Alfonso's diplomacy relied heavily on expensive gifts to maintain alliances\n\nCourt magnificence: His court was one of the most splendid in Europe\n\nOutstanding debts: Loans from Florentine and Genoese bankers likely remain\n\nD100 Table: Combined Treasury of Aragon and Naples\n\nRoll\nTreasury Found\nDescription\n1-5\nHeavy Debt: -50,000 to -100,000 florins\nDisaster. Alfonso died deeply in debt to Italian bankers. The treasury contains only promissory notes and demands for repayment. Juan inherits not wealth but obligations that must be addressed immediately or face seizure of crown assets.\n6-15\nDepleted: 0-25,000 florins\nAlfonso spent nearly everything. The treasury holds barely enough to cover a few months of household expenses. The magnificent court was funded by mortgaging the future. Major economies are required immediately.\n16-25\nMinimal: 25,000-50,000 florins\nThe cupboards are nearly bare. Alfonso's spending exceeded his revenues in his final years. Some debts remain outstanding. Naples and Aragon together provide perhaps two months' operating expenses.\n26-40\nModest: 50,000-100,000 florins\nAlfonso maintained basic reserves but little more. The treasury can cover immediate expenses and Your Majesty's commitments, but leaves no cushion for unexpected costs. Careful management is required.\n41-55\nAdequate: 100,000-150,000 florins\nA reasonable inheritance. Alfonso balanced his spending against revenues in his final years. The treasury provides a working reserve equivalent to roughly half a year's expenses. Your Majesty's road and port programs can proceed, though not simultaneously.\n56-70\nSolid: 150,000-200,000 florins\nAlfonso proved more prudent than his reputation suggested, or perhaps the peaceful years allowed accumulation. The treasury provides a meaningful reserve. Your Majesty's announced programs can proceed as planned.\n71-85\nStrong: 200,000-275,000 florins\nThe conquest of Naples generated substantial wealth that Alfonso husbanded carefully. Perhaps he was preparing for further campaigns. The treasury represents nearly a full year of combined revenues—a significant inheritance.\n86-95\nExcellent: 275,000-350,000 florins\nAlfonso, for all his spending, was fundamentally a shrewd administrator. He extracted more from Naples than anyone expected and saved more than his magnificent court suggested. Your Majesty inherits a genuine war chest.\n96-100\nExceptional: 350,000-450,000 florins\nThe records were more incomplete than they appeared. Hidden reserves, unclaimed revenues, recovered debts—Alfonso left behind far more than even his closest advisors knew. Combined with Your Majesty's Castilian treasury, this represents transformative wealth.\n\nDiego adds a final note:\n\n\"Whatever the treasury contains, Your Majesty should understand that the annual position matters more than the current reserves. Naples theoretically yields 250,000-280,000 ducats annually; Aragon yields 100,000-120,000 florins. If Your Majesty's reforms can capture even half the lost revenues, the long-term position is strong. The treasury balance determines only how quickly we can move.\"\n\nWhen you're ready, roll the d100 for Alfonso's treasury.",

      "text": "Diego needs to ask remaining questions to draft a complete 1437 budget. Let me think about what he'd need to know:\n\n1. The infrastructure commitments in Naples - 70,000 for roads, 50,000 for ports - over how many years?\n2. The tax reduction for nobles - how much does this cost annually?\n3. Constantinople - current status of expenses and revenues\n4. Where will Juan reside? This affects household costs\n5. Viceroys needed for kingdoms where Juan isn't present\n6. Any other commitments made in Aragon or Naples\n7. The new Fueros provisions - registry system, Sacred Treasury, etc. - do they have costs?\n\nLet me have Diego work through these systematically.\n\nDiego nods, making a note.\n\n\"You are correct, Your Majesty. I will standardize all figures to Florentine florins for consistency with our existing accounts. The ducat and florin are functionally equivalent—both approximately 3.5 grams of fine gold—so the conversion is straightforward. From this point forward, all figures will be in florins.\"\n\nHe consults his notes again.\n\n\"The treasury inheritance falls in the solid range—I will use 175,000 florins as our working figure. Combined with Castile's projected year-end treasury of approximately 585,000 florins from 1436, Your Majesty commands substantial resources.\"\n\nDiego pulls out a fresh sheet of parchment.\n\n\"Before I can draft the full budget, I need clarity on several points. Some are matters of Your Majesty's intent; others require decisions that only the crown can make.\"\n\n\"First: The infrastructure commitments in Naples.\"\n\n\"Your Majesty announced 70,000 florins for roads and bridges, and 50,000 florins for ports—120,000 florins total. Over what timeframe? If this is a single year's commitment, it will consume nearly half of Naples' annual revenues. If spread over three years, it becomes 40,000 annually—substantial but manageable. Over five years, roughly 24,000 annually.\"\n\n\"What is Your Majesty's intent?\"\n\n\"Second: The noble tax reduction in Naples.\"\n\n\"Your Majesty declared that nobles holding lands in feudum shall pay only half their obligations for three years. The Prince of Taranto estimated the nobility's share of the focatico at perhaps 40,000-50,000 florins of the 80,000 collected. Half of that is 20,000-25,000 florins in forgone revenue annually, for three years.\"\n\n\"This is a cost we must account for. I estimate 22,000 florins annually in reduced Neapolitan revenue for 1437, 1438, and 1439.\"\n\n\"Third: The city charters in Naples.\"\n\n\"Your Majesty's amnesty addressed noble arrears clearly. But the city representatives have been asking whether their ancient charter payments are also forgiven or reduced. The cities pay fixed sums based on agreements from generations ago—these were not explicitly mentioned in your coronation address.\"\n\n\"Do we extend similar treatment to the cities? If so, the revenue impact is smaller—perhaps 5,000-8,000 florins annually—but the political goodwill may be substantial.\"\n\n\"Fourth: Aragon's new institutions.\"\n\n\"The three new Books of Fueros Your Majesty negotiated create ongoing costs:\n\nThe Central Registry of Privileges will require clerks, scribes, and record-keepers working under the Justicia. I estimate 2,000-3,000 florins annually to establish and maintain.\n\nThe Sacred Treasury of the Crusade (Arca Sacra Cruciatae) will require administration, though it should eventually be self-funding from the clarified tercias.\n\nThe petition to Rome regarding the tercias may require diplomatic expenses—perhaps 1,000-2,000 florins for the mission.\n\n\"Should I include these costs?\"\n\n\"Fifth: Royal households and viceroys.\"\n\n\"Your Majesty now holds three crowns. Where will the court reside? And who governs where the king is not?\"\n\n\"If the court remains primarily in Toledo, Naples and Aragon require viceroys or governors—men of sufficient rank and authority to act in Your Majesty's name. Such men expect substantial compensation. A viceroy for Naples might cost 8,000-12,000 florins annually in salary, household, and administrative support. A governor for Aragon, perhaps 5,000-8,000 florins.\"\n\n\"Alternatively, if Your Majesty intends to travel between realms, we must budget for a mobile court—substantially more expensive than a fixed one.\"\n\n\"What are Your Majesty's intentions?\"\n\n\"Sixth: Constantinople.\"\n\n\"The 1436 budget projected Constantinople revenues of 7,900 florins growing to 12,000 in 1437, with annual expenses of 25,300 florins—primarily Emperor John VIII's pension of 22,000 florins. Are these figures still accurate? Have the settlement convoys continued as planned? Should I maintain the 20,000 florin commitment for wall repairs, or has that work progressed sufficiently to reduce it?\"\n\n\"Seventh: The African ventures and existing Castilian commitments.\"\n\n\"The Mali/Timbuktu expedition was funded in full in 1436—40,000 florins. The 1436 budget shows ongoing African outpost maintenance of 8,000 florins, projected to rise to 10,000 in 1437. The naval operations budget stands at 45,000 florins annually. The artillery budget of 17,000 florins begins in 1437.\"\n\n\"Should I carry these forward unchanged, or have circumstances altered any of these commitments?\"\n\n\"Eighth: Queen María of Aragon.\"\n\n\"King Alfonso's widow has accepted Your Majesty's invitation to Toledo. She will require a household appropriate to her station—a dowager queen of Aragon. I estimate 3,000-5,000 florins annually for her maintenance, depending on the magnificence expected.\"\n\n\"Ninth: New diplomatic costs.\"\n\n\"Your Majesty now has interests spanning from Castile to Naples to Constantinople. The existing diplomatic budget of 12,100 florins covers Rome, Aragon, Portugal, and Basel. We will need expanded representation—particularly permanent embassies or agents in Milan, Venice, Florence, and perhaps Genoa. The Italian powers will expect a king of Naples to maintain proper diplomatic presence.\"\n\n\"I estimate an additional 8,000-12,000 florins annually for expanded diplomatic establishment.\"\n\nDiego sets down his quill and looks up.\n\n\"Once Your Majesty answers these questions, I can draft a complete unified budget for 1437 across all three crowns, Constantinople, and the African ventures. The fundamental question is this: do we prioritize aggressive investment in Naples' infrastructure now, accepting several years of tight finances? Or do we spread commitments over a longer timeframe, building reserves for the Ottoman campaign planned for 1440?\"\n\n\"Both approaches are viable. The choice depends on Your Majesty's strategic priorities.\"",

No-one is owed back taxes to the crown. But the cities do not pay half taxes like the nobles do. That only applies to nobles and the lands they hold in feudum contract. Other types of taxes they are owed are not reduced.\n\nYes, implement these costs. But the treasury for the crusade should not be too complicated. I spend much more on the war against the ottomans than I recieve from the Aragonese church. They will just pay and we evaluate if the amount is less than is spent on the war. As long as this is the case, than we need no extra administration. And I do not expect it to change soon.\n\nInclude only the cost for the palaces and the administrative support for those. I will appoint governors.\n\nThe growth of the city is enormous. There is still very entusiastic growth coming in from all kinds of christendom. And the resettlement program from Castille is progressing as well. This year, my fleet can transport 12,360 settlers. Draft a d100 table to see how the growth of the city goes. Will the military orders find all settlers the ships can support? Will settlers from other kingdoms continue to come? Evaluate and be historic and draft a d100 table. Then we can more accurately establish the revenue of the city based on this.",

      "text": "\"Understood, Your Majesty. Let me confirm my understanding on the noble tax assessment.\"\n\nHe pauses, working through the implications.\n\n\"This is clever. By conducting a new census with royal assessors, we establish the true number of hearths on each baron's lands—likely far more than the outdated records show. The baron then pays half of this newly assessed amount. For a baron who was previously paying, say, 500 florins based on ancient records showing 500 hearths, but whose lands actually contain 1,000 hearths—he now pays 500 florins based on half of the accurate count.\"\n\n\"In effect, many barons will pay approximately what they paid before, or only slightly less. Those who were honest will see genuine relief. Those who were cheating will find their 'reduction' merely brings them to accurate payment. And in three years, when the half-rate expires, the crown collects the full amount based on the new census.\"\n\nHe allows himself a slight smile.\n\n\"The barons will realize this eventually. But by then, the census will be complete, the records established, and the principle accepted. Your Majesty has traded three years of patience for permanent improvement in collection.\"\n\n\"On Constantinople and the settlement program—yes, this requires careful evaluation.\"\n\nDiego pulls out the relevant documents from 1436.\n\n\"The settlement convoys have been remarkably successful. The initial chaos of volunteers from across Christendom has given way to more organized recruitment, primarily through the Military Orders and crown agents in Castile. The 1436 projections showed fleet capacity of 8,920 settlers; Your Majesty indicates this has grown to 12,360 for 1437.\"\n\n\"But capacity and actual settlers are different matters. Let me consider the factors.\"\n\nConstantinople Settlement - 1437 Chaos Roll\n\nContext\n\nConstantinople fell into Christian hands in 1433-1434 through Juan's crusade. The city was severely depopulated—the Byzantine Empire's capital had shrunk from perhaps 400,000 at its height to perhaps 40,000-50,000 by the 1430s under Ottoman pressure. The Latin settlement program aims to repopulate the city and its Thracian hinterland with Catholic settlers who will create a sustainable Christian presence.\n\nThe Military Orders (Santiago, Calatrava, Alcántara) have committed to recruiting and organizing settlers from Castile. Additionally, volunteers from across Christendom—particularly Italy, Greece, and the Balkans—have been arriving independently.\n\nFactors Favoring Strong Settlement\n\nPrevious success (Roll 99 in 1436): The settlement program has exceeded all expectations; momentum builds on itself\n\nIncreased fleet capacity: 12,360 settler spaces available, up from 8,920\n\nMilitary Orders' commitment: The Orders have established recruitment networks across Castile\n\nLand grants: Settlers receive land in Thrace—genuine opportunity for landless peasants and younger sons\n\nReligious enthusiasm: Constantinople is a holy cause; the city of the great councils, of Hagia Sophia\n\nJuan's reputation: The king who conquered Granada and saved Constantinople—his crusade draws followers\n\nEstablished infrastructure: Previous convoys have created reception systems, housing, and support\n\nEconomic opportunity: Constantinople's position on trade routes offers commercial prospects\n\nEscape from Iberian constraints: For conversos, younger sons, the ambitious—a fresh start\n\nFactors Creating Risk\n\nDistance and danger: The journey is long; the Ottoman threat remains real\n\nDisease: New arrivals to Constantinople historically suffer high mortality from unfamiliar diseases\n\nSettler quality: As the most enthusiastic volunteers have already gone, later waves may be less committed\n\nCompetition for labor: Castile's own economic development programs need workers\n\nOttoman hostility: Murad II has not accepted the loss of Constantinople; the frontier is tense\n\nGreek Orthodox resistance: Native Greeks may resent Latin settlers; tensions could discourage newcomers\n\nRecruitment fatigue: The Military Orders have already sent their most willing volunteers\n\nWinter conditions: Constantinople's climate differs significantly from Iberia; adjustment is difficult\n\nFamily reluctance: Men willing to go as soldiers may be less willing to bring wives and children permanently\n\nItalian competition: Genoa and Venice have their own interests; they may discourage their subjects from joining a Castilian-led venture\n\nD100 Table: Constantinople Settlement 1437\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-5\nDisaster. Disease outbreak among the convoy, Ottoman raid on settler camps, or catastrophic storm at sea. Fewer than 3,000 settlers arrive alive and healthy. Many who survive lose heart and attempt to return. The settlement program suffers a severe setback; word spreads across Christendom that Constantinople is a death trap. Volunteer flow from other kingdoms dries up entirely.\n6-15\nSevere Difficulties. Major problems—perhaps plague in the staging areas, Ottoman harassment of Thracian settlements, or a failed harvest requiring emergency food imports. Only 4,000-6,000 settlers successfully established. The Military Orders report increasing difficulty finding willing recruits; the enthusiasm of 1434-1436 is fading. Foreign volunteers have largely stopped coming.\n16-25\nDisappointing. The program continues but momentum has slowed. 6,000-8,000 settlers arrive, well below fleet capacity. The Military Orders fill perhaps half their allocated spaces. Foreign volunteers trickle in—perhaps 500-1,000 from Italy, Greece, and elsewhere. Constantinople's growth continues but at a reduced pace.\n26-40\nBelow Expectations. 8,000-10,000 settlers arrive. The Castilian recruitment fills most spaces, but the Military Orders report that the easiest volunteers have already gone. Foreign arrivals remain modest—perhaps 1,000-1,500. Constantinople grows steadily but not dramatically. The city's population approaches 60,000-65,000.\n41-55\nMeeting Targets. 10,000-12,000 settlers arrive, roughly filling available fleet capacity. The Military Orders maintain their recruitment networks effectively. Foreign volunteers continue at the 1,500-2,000 level—Italians seeking opportunity, Greeks returning to their ancestral city, even some Hungarians and Germans drawn by religious enthusiasm. Constantinople's population approaches 65,000-70,000.\n56-70\nExceeding Expectations. 12,000-14,000 settlers successfully established—the fleet runs at full capacity and some additional settlers arrive on Italian merchant vessels. The Military Orders report sustained enthusiasm; families are now coming, not just single men. Foreign volunteers reach 2,500-3,000. Constantinople's population approaches 70,000-75,000. Thracian agricultural settlements begin producing surplus.\n71-85\nStrong Growth. 14,000-16,000 settlers arrive. The Military Orders expand their recruitment beyond their usual networks; minor nobles begin sending younger sons. Foreign volunteers surge to 3,500-4,500—word of successful settlement has spread. Genoese and Venetian merchants, despite their governments' reservations, see opportunity and encourage craftsmen to relocate. Constantinople's population approaches 75,000-80,000.\n86-95\nRemarkable Success. 16,000-18,000 settlers established. The program has achieved critical mass—settlers write home describing opportunity, and families follow. The Military Orders find recruitment easier, not harder, as success breeds success. Foreign volunteers reach 5,000-6,000; even some French and German settlers arrive. Constantinople's population approaches 80,000-85,000. The city is visibly recovering; empty quarters are being rebuilt.\n96-100\nTransformative Year. 18,000-20,000+ settlers arrive. The trickle becomes a flood. Settler ships are overbooked; some pay their own passage on merchant vessels. The Military Orders establish permanent recruitment offices in major Castilian cities. Foreign volunteers exceed 7,000—Italians, Greeks, Bulgarians, even Armenians fleeing Ottoman pressure. Constantinople's population approaches 85,000-90,000. For the first time since the Fourth Crusade, the city begins to feel like a true capital again. Hagia Sophia's services draw thousands. The markets bustle. The walls are manned.\n\nRevenue Implications\n\nDiego adds a note:\n\n\"Constantinople's revenues scale roughly with population and economic activity. For each tier of settlement success, I would adjust the revenue projection accordingly:\n\nRolls 1-15: Revenue stagnates or declines—perhaps 8,000-10,000 florins\n\nRolls 16-40: Modest growth—12,000-15,000 florins\n\nRolls 41-55: Meeting projections—15,000-18,000 florins\n\nRolls 56-70: Strong growth—18,000-22,000 florins\n\nRolls 71-85: Excellent—22,000-28,000 florins\n\nRolls 86-100: Exceptional—28,000-35,000 florins\n\n\"These figures assume proportional growth in customs, market fees, land taxes, and harbor dues as population and commerce expand.\"\n\n\"When Your Majesty is ready, roll for the settlement outcome. Then I can incorporate the results into the Constantinople section of the budget.\"",

      "text": "Now they want me to:\n1. Use this population level to make a detailed estimate of Constantinople's revenues based on actual revenue streams\n2. Ask if I have any other questions before drafting the budget\n\nLet me think about Constantinople's revenue streams based on what we've established:\n\nFrom the 1436 budget, Constantinople's revenues were:\n- Constantinople Customs: 3,500 florins\n- Land Taxes: 1,200 florins (Thracian territories, Latin settlers)\n- Imperial Estates: 800 florins (Crown properties)\n- Market Fees & Guild Dues: 600 florins\n- Harbor & Anchorage: 500 florins\n- Judicial Revenue: 300 florins\n- Salt Monopoly: 200 florins\n- Latin Settler Contributions: 800 florins\n- Miscellaneous: 300 florins\nTotal: 7,900 florins (though they mentioned 8,200 in projections sheet)\n\nNow with population growing from perhaps 55,000-60,000 to 75,000-80,000 (roughly 30-40% increase), and with 14,000-16,000 new settlers plus 3,500-4,500 foreign volunteers, how should these revenue streams change?\n\nLet me think through each:\n\n1. **Customs**: This depends on trade volume, which relates to population and economic activity. Constantinople sits on crucial trade routes - Bosphorus control. With more population, more consumption, more trade. The city's strategic position means customs could grow significantly. Perhaps 5,000-6,500 florins.\n\n2. **Land Taxes**: With 14,000-16,000 new Castilian settlers plus several thousand foreign ones, many establishing farms in Thrace, this should grow substantially. \n\nWith increased population and new settlers, judicial revenues might see moderate growth. More people means more legal transactions, disputes, and court activities. Potential increase from 300 to 500-700 florins, reflecting the city's expanding administrative complexity.\n\nSalt trade monopoly will likely scale proportionally with population expansion. Estimated revenue between 350-450 florins, tracking demographic shifts.\n\nLatin settler contributions could be substantial during initial establishment. Potential range of 1,200-1,500 florins, though long-term contributions might stabilize after initial settlement phase.\n\nMiscellaneous revenues estimated around 400-500 florins, accounting for unexpected income streams.\n\nTotal estimated revenue for 1437 ranges from 13,000-18,000 florins, with significant caveats about ongoing city recovery and external economic pressures.\n\nKey considerations include infrastructure limitations, potential trade route disruptions, Ottoman regional tensions, and the economic integration of new settlers.\n\nPotential follow-up inquiries focus on diplomatic meeting costs from the Barcelona gathering and potential expenses related to Lucia's upcoming pregnancy.\n\nDiego makes careful notes on the settlement roll.\n\n\"Strong growth—14,000 to 16,000 settlers from Castile, plus 3,500 to 4,500 foreign volunteers. Constantinople's population will approach 75,000 to 80,000 by year's end. This is remarkable—the city has not held such numbers since before the Black Death ravaged it in the 1340s.\"\n\nHe pulls out the 1436 revenue breakdown for Constantinople and begins working through each stream.\n\nConstantinople Revenue Estimate - 1437\n\nBaseline: 1436 revenues of 7,900 florins with population approximately 55,000-60,000\n\nNew situation: Population approaching 75,000-80,000 (approximately 35% increase), with significant ongoing construction, settlement, and commercial recovery\n\nRevenue Stream Analysis\n\n1. Constantinople Customs (1436: 3,500 florins)\n\n\"The customs revenue depends on trade volume passing through the Bosphorus and the Golden Horn. Constantinople controls one of the world's great chokepoints—every ship passing between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean must pass under its walls.\"\n\n\"However, the city's commercial infrastructure remains damaged. The Venetian and Genoese quarters were disrupted during the conquest; merchant confidence is still rebuilding. The Latin settlement has brought consumers but not yet major merchants.\"\n\n\"With population growth and gradual trade recovery, I estimate customs revenue of 5,000-5,500 florins. The increase reflects more local consumption and modest growth in transit trade, but we have not yet restored Constantinople's historic role as a great emporium.\"\n\nEstimate: 5,200 florins\n\n2. Land Taxes - Thracian Territories (1436: 1,200 florins)\n\n\"This is where the settlement program shows its greatest impact. The 14,000-16,000 Castilian settlers are primarily establishing farms in the Thracian hinterland—land that was depopulated by decades of Ottoman raiding. Each settler family receiving a land grant owes taxes to the crown.\"\n\n\"The foreign volunteers—3,500-4,500 of them—include many Greeks returning to ancestral lands, Italians seeking opportunity, and others. They too will work land and owe taxes.\"\n\n\"However, new settlers typically receive tax exemptions for their first year or two to help them establish themselves. Many of this year's arrivals will not yet be paying full rates.\"\n\n\"I estimate land tax revenue of 2,800-3,200 florins—a substantial increase reflecting the cumulative effect of three years of settlement, with the earliest arrivals now paying full rates while newer ones remain partially exempt.\"\n\nEstimate: 3,000 florins\n\n3. Imperial Estates (1436: 800 florins)\n\n\"The crown properties in and around Constantinople—palaces, workshops, farms directly held by the imperial administration. These have been gradually restored and expanded as the settlement provides labor.\"\n\n\"The Great Palace complex remains largely ruined, but smaller properties are being rehabilitated. Some crown lands in Thrace are now being worked by tenants.\"\n\nEstimate: 1,100 florins\n\n4. Market Fees & Guild Dues (1436: 600 florins)\n\n\"With population growth of 35% and increasing economic activity, market fees scale accordingly. The foreign volunteers include craftsmen—Italian glassmakers, Greek goldsmiths, Armenian merchants—who are establishing workshops and forming guilds.\"\n\n\"The Latin settlers need goods and services; markets are expanding to serve them. The great bazaars are not yet restored to their former glory, but weekly markets in multiple quarters now operate regularly.\"\n\nEstimate: 1,000 florins\n\n5. Harbor & Anchorage Fees (1436: 500 florins)\n\n\"More ships serving more people. The settlement convoys alone bring substantial traffic, and merchant vessels increasingly call at Constantinople as confidence in the city's stability grows.\"\n\n\"The Golden Horn can accommodate hundreds of vessels; we are nowhere near capacity, but traffic is increasing steadily.\"\n\nEstimate: 850 florins\n\n6. Judicial Revenue (1436: 300 florins)\n\n\"More people means more disputes, more contracts, more court cases. The Latin courts established under the Charter are increasingly busy. Property disputes among settlers, commercial disagreements, criminal matters—all generate fees and fines.\"\n\nEstimate: 550 florins\n\n7. Salt Monopoly (1436: 200 florins)\n\n\"Salt consumption scales with population. The imperial salt monopoly, restored under crown administration, serves the growing city.\"\n\nEstimate: 350 florins\n\n8. Latin Settler Contributions (1436: 800 florins)\n\n\"This category captured various contributions from the settler community—tithes, special assessments, voluntary donations to the crusade. With the settler population now substantially larger and more established, these contributions grow.\"\n\n\"However, the most enthusiastic contributors gave heavily in the early years. The rate per settler may decline even as total numbers increase.\"\n\nEstimate: 1,400 florins\n\n9. Miscellaneous (1436: 300 florins)\n\n\"Various small sources—licensing fees, monopoly rents, fines, escheat of property without heirs, and so forth. These grow modestly with population.\"\n\nEstimate: 450 florins\n\nTotal Constantinople Revenue Estimate - 1437\n\nRevenue Stream\n1436 Actual\n1437 Estimate\nCustoms\n3,500\n5,200\nLand Taxes (Thrace)\n1,200\n3,000\nImperial Estates\n800\n1,100\nMarket Fees & Guild Dues\n600\n1,000\nHarbor & Anchorage\n500\n850\nJudicial Revenue\n300\n550\nSalt Monopoly\n200\n350\nLatin Settler Contributions\n800\n1,400\nMiscellaneous\n300\n450\nTOTAL\n7,900\n13,900\n\nDiego sets down his quill.\n\n\"Constantinople's revenues should approach 14,000 florins in 1437—a 76% increase over 1436. This reflects the cumulative effect of three years of successful settlement combined with this year's strong growth. The city is becoming economically viable, though it remains far from self-sustaining when we account for expenses—particularly Emperor John's pension of 22,000 florins.\"\n\nRemaining Questions\n\nDiego consults his notes one final time.\n\n\"I have a few more questions before I can complete the budget, Your Majesty.\"\n\n\"First: The Prince of Taranto's offer.\"\n\n\"At the coronation, the Prince proposed that nobles whose lands benefit from improved roads contribute labor and materials. If this offer is genuine and widespread, it could reduce the crown's road-building costs significantly—perhaps by 20-30%. Should I account for baronial contributions, or budget the full 70,000 florins over three years as crown expense alone?\"\n\n\"Second: Queen Lucia and the royal children.\"\n\n\"Her Majesty is due to deliver your sixth child in late 1437. The 1436 budget allocated 2,200 florins for her household and 1,500 for the royal children. With another child arriving, and the existing children growing, should I increase these allocations? And will there be any extraordinary expenses—celebrations, gifts, charitable distributions—associated with the birth?\"\n\n\"Third: The wool breeding program.\"\n\n\"The 1436 budget shows 6,000 florins for Year 2 of the wool breeding program—acquisition of English rams and crossbreeding efforts. Is this continuing into Year 3? The program was designed to eventually produce fine wool domestically, reducing dependence on English imports.\"\n\n\"Fourth: Royal travel.\"\n\n\"Your Majesty has traveled from Toledo to Zaragoza to Naples in the span of months. Will there be significant royal travel in 1437—returning to Castile, visiting other realms, attending councils? Travel with a royal retinue is expensive. Should I include a travel budget?\"\n\n\"Fifth: Military preparations.\"\n\n\"The Ottoman campaign is planned for 1440. Are there any specific military expenditures for 1437 beyond the standing commitments—the artillery budget of 17,000 florins, the naval operations of 45,000 florins, the garrisons and academies? Any new recruitment, equipment purchases, or fortification work?\"\n\n\"Sixth: The Barcelona meeting.\"\n\n\"The 1436 budget noted a 'Barcelona meeting (Spring 1437)' as 'not included per royal instruction.' Did this meeting occur? Were there expenses? Should similar diplomatic gatherings be budgeted for the coming year?\"\n\n\"Once Your Majesty clarifies these points, I can draft the complete unified budget for 1437.\"",

Let me now work through the remaining questions and prepare for the budget.\n\nLet me summarize what I now know:\n\n1. Naples infrastructure - spread over 3 years (40,000 florins/year), with baronial contributions reducing crown costs by 20-30%. Need a roll to determine effectiveness.\n\n2.

The question is whether this enthusiasm translates into actual work.\"\n\n\n\"I propose a chaos roll to determine how effectively the barons follow through. The factors are mixed.\"\n\n\n\nNaples Road-Building Initiative - D100 Table\n\n\nContext\n\n\nAt Juan's coronation, he announced 70,000 florins for roads and bridges over three years (~23,300 florins annually). The Prince of Taranto proposed that nobles whose lands benefit from improved roads contribute labor and materials, with these contributions counted as taxes paid in natura.\n\n\nThis is an unusual arrangement. Neapolitan barons are not accustomed to cooperative ventures with the crown. However, roads genuinely benefit their estates—better roads mean easier transport of goods to markets, higher land values, and improved military communication.\n\n\nFactors Favoring Strong Participation\n\n\nSelf-interest: Roads benefit baronial estates directly—easier commerce, higher productivity\n\nPrince of Taranto's leadership: The most powerful baron publicly endorsed the initiative\n\nTax credit appeal: Contributing labor/materials counts against tax obligations—an attractive arrangement\n\nEnthusiastic reception: Juan's coronation (Roll 70) created genuine goodwill\n\nVisible royal investment: The crown is spending real money; this isn't an unfunded mandate\n\nReputation opportunity: Barons can claim credit for improvements on their lands\n\nNew king, fresh start: The tax amnesty has reset relationships; goodwill exists\n\n\nFactors Creating Risk\n\n\nNeapolitan baronial culture: These men are not accustomed to cooperation with the crown\n\nCoordination challenges: No existing mechanism for baronial road contributions\n\nFree-rider problem: Each baron hopes others will contribute while he keeps his resources\n\nQuality concerns: Baronial labor may be poorly supervised, producing substandard work\n\nRegional variation: Some regions have active barons; others are neglected by absentee lords\n\nHidden resistance: Don Juan de Híjar and the hostile faction may quietly sabotage\n\nCompeting priorities: Barons have their own projects and may divert promised resources\n\nSkepticism of royal promises: Previous kings promised much and delivered little\n\n\n\nD100 Table: Naples Road-Building Initiative (1437)\n\nRoll\nOutcome\nCost Reduction\n1-10\nFailure. Despite public enthusiasm, almost no barons actually contribute. The Prince of Taranto provides token support; others claim hardship or make excuses. Don Juan de Híjar's faction actively undermines the effort. The crown must fund the full program alone, and the initiative becomes an embarrassment.\n0%\n11-20\nMinimal participation. A handful of loyalist barons contribute labor and materials, but most do nothing. Perhaps 10-15% of the theoretical baronial contribution materializes. The roads proceed, but entirely on crown funds with minor baronial assistance.\n5-10%\n21-35\nDisappointing. Perhaps a quarter of barons participate meaningfully, contributing labor and local materials. Work quality varies—some sections well-built, others shoddy. The crown saves some money but less than hoped.\n15-20%\n36-50\nModest success. About half of barons participate to some degree. The Prince of Taranto sets a good example; others follow his lead in their regions. Work proceeds on schedule in some areas, slowly in others. Crown costs reduced meaningfully.\n20-25%\n51-65\nMeeting expectations. A majority of barons contribute labor and materials for roads crossing their lands. The tax-credit arrangement proves attractive. Quality is acceptable. The program proceeds roughly as hoped.\n25-30%\n66-80\nExceeding expectations. Strong baronial participation. The Prince of Taranto personally supervises work in his territories; other major barons follow suit. Competition emerges—lords want their roads completed first. Quality is good. Crown costs significantly reduced.\n30-35%\n81-90\nImpressive cooperation. Baronial contributions exceed expectations. Even some members of the hostile faction participate, unwilling to be seen as obstructing popular improvements. Local pride drives quality work. The program becomes a model of crown-baronial cooperation.\n35-40%\n91-95\nRemarkable success. Near-universal baronial participation. The initiative transforms from royal project to shared endeavor. Barons compete for recognition. Some contribute more than required, hoping for royal favor. Roads completed ahead of schedule in some regions.\n40-45%\n96-100\nTransformative. The road initiative becomes a genuinely collaborative enterprise. Even hostile barons participate rather than be excluded from visible progress. Local communities contribute beyond baronial requirements. The program creates a new model for crown-baronial relations in Naples—cooperation rather than confrontation.\n45-50%\n\n\nDiego sets the table aside.\n\n\n\"When Your Majesty is ready, roll for the road initiative. The result will determine how much we can reduce the infrastructure budget line.\"\n\n\n\n\"On the other matters:\"\n\n\n\"For Queen Lucia and the royal children, I will increase the allocation to 3,000 florins for Her Majesty's household—she now presides over a court that includes three crowns—and 2,500 florins for the royal children, accounting for Princess Juana's birth and the growing household at Casa de las Palomas. I will add 500 florins for birth celebrations and charitable distributions.\"\n\n\n\"For the wool breeding program, Year 3 continues at 6,000 florins—this is the final major investment year before the crossbred flocks begin producing improved wool.\"\n\n\n\"For royal travel, I estimate 8,000-10,000 florins annually. Your Majesty has traveled from Toledo to Zaragoza to Barcelona to Naples this year alone, with substantial retinues. The mobile court is expensive but necessary when ruling three kingdoms.\"\n\n\n\"For the Barcelona visit with the royal family, I estimate 3,000-4,000 florins—lodging, entertainment, gifts to local notables, and the expenses of moving the queen and children.

      "text": "Thought process: Synthesized regional finances and calculated Naples road initiative savings.\n\nThe user rolled 33 on the Naples road-building initiative, which falls in the \"Disappointing\" range (21-35): about a quarter of barons participate meaningfully, contributing labor and local materials. Work quality varies. The crown saves some money but less than hoped. Cost reduction: 15-20%.\n\nSo the 70,000 florins over 3 years (~23,333/year) gets reduced by about 17.5% (midpoint of 15-20%), meaning approximately 19,250 florins/year, or about 57,750 total over three years instead of 70,000.\n\nNow I need to draft a comprehensive 1437 budget that integrates:\n\n1. **Castile** - Base revenues from 1436 budget (~373,450 florins), expenses, and development programs\n2. **Aragon** - ~110,000 florins revenue, constrained by fueros\n3. **Naples** - ~275,000 florins theoretical, but with the 50% noble tax reduction and new assessment\n4. **Constantinople** - 13,900 florins revenue (as calculated), 25,300+ expenses\n5. **African ventures** - Small but growing\n\nLet me think through this carefully.\n\nI should read the 1436 budget file to get the exact structure and figures. Let me access the uploaded files.\n\nActually, the user uploaded several Excel files but they appear as empty document content in the context. I should use the computer tools to read these files.\n\nLet me check what files are available and read the 1436 finances file to get the baseline.\n\n\nDiego notes the result with a slight frown.\n\n\n\"Disappointing, but not unexpected. About a quarter of the barons contribute meaningfully—the Prince of Taranto and his closest allies, primarily. The others make excuses or provide token assistance. We save perhaps 15-20% on road costs, not the 30-40% we might have hoped for.\"\n\n\n\"I will budget the road program at approximately 19,500 florins annually instead of 23,300—a savings of roughly 3,800 florins per year, or 11,400 over the three-year program.\"\n\n\n\n\"Now, let me draft the complete budget. I will need to review the 1436 Castilian accounts for the baseline structure.\"\n\n\nView: Reading the XLSX skill to properly handle the budget spreadsheet\n\n\nThought process: Examined prior budget structure to inform new draft.\n\nNow let me read the 1436 budget file to understand its structure before creating the 1437 budget.\n\n\nBash Tool: Reading the 1435 Castile budget to understand the structure for the 1437 unified budget\n\n\nThought process\n\nLet me check what files are actually in the uploads directory.\n\n\nBash Tool: Listing the uploads directory to find the budget files\n\n\nThought process: Pivoted file location strategy mid-process.\n\nI see - the 1436 file is available. Let me read that one. The 1435 file must be in the project directory instead.\n\n\nBash Tool: Reading the 1436 Castile budget to understand the structure\n\n\nThought process: Synthesized multi-realm revenues and expenses into unified budget.\n\nExcellent! Now I have a clear picture of the 1436 budget structure. Let me now create the 1437 unified budget incorporating:\n\n1. **Castile** - Base revenues continuing with growth, economic development continuing\n2. **Aragon** - New ~110,000 florins revenue, with new institutions costs\n3. **Naples** - ~275,000 florins revenue, minus noble tax reduction, plus infrastructure costs\n4. **Constantinople** - 13,900 florins revenue (as calculated), ongoing expenses\n5. **African ventures** - Maintenance continuing\n\nKey changes from 1436:\n- Add Aragon revenues (~110,000)\n- Add Naples revenues (~275,000 actual collection, minus noble reduction)\n- Add infrastructure costs for Naples (roads 19,500/year after baronial reduction, ports ~16,700/year)\n- Add Neapolitan household/garrison/fleet expenses (~85,000-95,000)\n- Add Aragonese household/administration expenses (~20,000-25,000)\n- Add viceregal costs for both (palaces/admin, not governors themselves)\n- Add Queen María's household (3,000-5,000)\n- Add Barcelona visit costs (~3,500)\n- Add royal travel costs (~9,000)\n- Add diplomatic expansion for Italian courts (~10,000)\n- Continue economic development programs\n- Add artillery budget (17,000)\n- Continue wool breeding Year 3 (6,000)\n\nLet me now calculate and create this budget.\n\nREVENUES:\n**Castile** (from 1436 sheet):\n- Base Crown: ~182,700 (slight growth to ~185,000)\n- Trade: ~100,500 (growth to ~103,000)\n- Crown Estates: ~39,500 (stable)\n- Economic Development: ~7,750 (growing to ~8,500)\n- Reform Improvements: 15,000 (stable)\n- Noble Taxation: 28,000 (stable)\n\n\n- Total Castile: ~379,000 (slight growth from 373,450)\n\nI'm tracking the Aragonese and Neapolitan revenues carefully. Aragon's ~110,000 is constrained by fueros and has a mortgaged patrimony. Naples presents a more complex revenue picture, with the focatico revealing significant collection challenges. The Prince of Taranto confirms actual collection around 80,000, which suggests substantial revenue optimization is needed.\n\nBarons are currently paying roughly 27-29% of their theoretical tax obligation. The new census offers an opportunity to establish accurate hearth counts and restructure tax collection. By implementing a 50% assessment on true hearth numbers, we could potentially increase focatico revenues from 80,000 to 140,000 - a dramatic improvement.\n\nThe implementation will likely be gradual, with partial execution in the first year. Most barons have been systematically underreporting, so this new approach represents a significant fiscal reform.\n\nPreliminary calculations suggest noble lands comprise 60-70% of total hearths, with cities maintaining their current contribution. In the first year of reform, Naples might see focatico revenues around 100,000 - a modest but meaningful increase from previous collections.\n\nThe key is balanced implementation: ensuring accurate assessment while preventing complete economic disruption for nobility.\n\nRevenue streams break down systematically: customs at 100,000, salt at 30,000, with additional sources contributing around 45,000. After accounting for noble tax reduction and partial honest assessment improvements, Naples likely generates approximately 268,000 in total revenue.\n\nSupplementary income streams emerge from Constantinople at 13,900 and African ventures at 2,000, indicating a diversified financial approach.\n\nThe comprehensive revenue calculation reaches roughly 772,900 florins, integrating contributions from Castile, Aragon, Naples, Constantinople, and African territories.\n\nTreasury analysis reveals a substantial opening balance. By combining Castile's year-end funds of 585,651 with Alfonso's inherited 175,000, the initial treasury stands at 760,651 florins - a robust financial foundation for strategic planning.\n\nDetailed budget preparation becomes the next critical step in financial management.\n\n\nNow I have the structure. Let me create the comprehensive 1437 unified budget incorporating all three crowns.\n\n\nBash Tool: Creating the Treasury Summary sheet for the 1437 budget\n\n\nThought process: Orchestrated budget framework expansion with additional sheets.\n\nGood start. Now I need to add the Revenue, Expenses, and other sheets. Let me continue building this out.\n\n\nBash Tool: Creating the Revenue sheet for the 1437 budget\n\n\nThought process: Charted comprehensive expense framework across multiple domains.\n\nGood progress. Now I need to create the Expenses sheet, which will be comprehensive covering all four realms.\n\n\nBash Tool: Creating the Expenses sheet for the 1437 budget\n\n\nThought process: Orchestrated budget framework with projections and economic measures.\n\nGood progress. Now let me add a Projections sheet and an Economic Measures sheet to complete the budget.\n\n\nBash Tool: Creating the Projections sheet for 1437-1442\n\n\nThought process: Orchestrated budget completion with economic measures integration.\n\nGood, now let me add the Economic Measures sheet and finalize the budget.\n\n\nBash Tool: Creating the Economic Measures sheet\n\n\nThought process: Orchestrated budget structure alignment and formula recalculation.\n\nNow let me add one more sheet for African Ventures to match the structure of the 1436 budget, then recalculate the formulas.\n\n\nBash Tool: Creating the African Ventures sheet\n\n\nThought process\n\nNow I need to recalculate all the formulas using the recalc.py script.\n\n\nBash Tool: Recalculating formulas in the budget spreadsheet\n\n\nThought process: Verified calculations and prepared budget presentation.\n\nThe formulas have been recalculated successfully with no errors. Now let me verify the Treasury Summary sheet to make sure the numbers are correct, then present the file to the user.\n\n\nBash Tool: Verifying the Treasury Summary calculations\n\n\nThought process: Verified numerical accuracy and projection calculations.\n\nThe numbers look good. Let me verify the projections sheet as well to make sure it's calculating correctly.\n\n\nBash Tool: Verifying the Projections sheet calculations\n\n\nThought process: Audited financial figures and rectified computational discrepancy.\n\nThe numbers look good! The Treasury Summary shows:\n- Opening Treasury: 760,651 florins (585,651 from Castile 1436 + 175,000 inherited from Alfonso)\n- Total Revenue: 757,900 florins\n- Total Expenses: 444,200 florins  \n- Net Surplus: 313,700 florins\n- Year-End Treasury: 1,074,351 florins\n\nWait, I need to check the one-time expenses total. In the Treasury Summary, it shows 59,500 florins for one-time expenses, but in the Projections sheet it shows 76,000 florins for total one-time. Let me check the discrepancy.\n\nLooking at the Expenses sheet, I had:\n- Constantinople: 15,000 (walls) + 12,000 (settlement) = 27,000\n- Castilian: 6,000 (wool) + 9,000 (travel) + 3,500 (Barcelona) + 500 (birth) = 19,000\n- Naval: 30,000\n\nTotal should be: 27,000 + 19,000 + 30,000 = 76,000\n\nBut I wrote 59,500 in the Treasury Summary. This is an error - the correct number is 76,000.\n\nLet me fix this.\n\n\nBash Tool: Fixing the one-time expenses total in Treasury Summary\n\n\nThought process\n\nNow I need to recalculate the formulas again to update the totals.\n\n\nBash Tool: Recalculating formulas after fixing one-time expenses\n\n\nThought process: Verified Treasury Summary before drafting budget.\n\nGood. Let me verify the Treasury Summary one more time.\n\n\nBash Tool: Verifying the corrected Treasury Summary\n\n\nThought process: Reconciling budget figures and verifying fiscal projections.\n\nNow the numbers are consistent:\n- Opening Treasury: 760,651 florins\n- Total Revenue: 757,900 florins\n- Total Expenses: 460,700 florins\n- Net Surplus: 297,200 florins\n- Year-End Treasury: 1,057,851 florins\n\nThis matches the Projections sheet (1437 net surplus of 297,200 and year-end treasury of 1,057,851).\n\nNow let me copy the file to the outputs directory and present it to the user.\n\n\nBash Tool: Copying the budget file to outputs directory\n\n\nThought process\n\nNow let me present the file and provide a summary for Diego de Daza to present to Juan.\n\n\nPresent File: /mnt/user-data/outputs/Castile_1437_Finances_Complete.xlsx\n\n\nThought process: Pivoted toward narrative perspective for budget documentation.\n\nNow let me provide a narrative summary from Diego's perspective.\n\n\nDiego sets aside his quill and presents the completed document.\n\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, the unified budget for 1437 is complete.\"\n\n\nHe taps the parchment's summary figures.\n\n\n\nTreasury Summary - 1437\n\n\nOpening Position (January 1, 1437)\n\nSource\nAmount\nCastilian Treasury (1436 year-end)\n585,651 fl\nInherited from Alfonso V (Roll 65)\n175,000 fl\nTOTAL OPENING\n760,651 fl\n\n\nRevenues\n\nCrown\nAmount\nCastile\n379,000 fl\nAragon\n110,000 fl\nNaples\n253,000 fl\nConstantinople\n13,900 fl\nAfrican Ventures\n2,000 fl\nTOTAL REVENUE\n757,900 fl\n\n\nExpenses\n\nCategory\nAmount\nCastilian Annual\n206,700 fl\nAragonese Annual\n28,500 fl\nNeapolitan Annual\n113,500 fl\nConstantinople Annual\n26,000 fl\nAfrican Maintenance\n10,000 fl\nOne-Time Expenses\n76,000 fl\nTOTAL EXPENSES\n460,700 fl\n\n\nNet Position\n\nAmount\nNet Surplus\n297,200 fl\nYear-End Treasury\n1,057,851 fl\n\n\nDiego looks up with evident satisfaction.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty now commands revenues exceeding 757,000 florins annually—more than double what Castile alone produced three years ago. Even after the substantial costs of governing three kingdoms, maintaining Constantinople, and investing in infrastructure, the treasury will exceed one million florins by year's end.\"\n\n\n\"The Naples road initiative performed disappointingly—Roll 33 means only about a quarter of the barons contributed meaningfully. The Prince of Taranto did his part, but most others made excuses. We saved perhaps 17% rather than the 30-40% we might have hoped. Still, the roads will be built; it simply costs the crown more.\"\n\n\nHe points to the projections.\n\n\n\"Looking ahead: by 1440, when Your Majesty's Ottoman campaign is planned, the treasury should approach 2.4 million florins. The infrastructure investments in both Castile and Naples will have concluded, reducing annual costs by over 75,000 florins. Constantinople's revenues continue their remarkable growth—the settlement program has been transformative. And African ventures should achieve profitability by then.\"\n\n\n\"One note of caution: the economic development program has finally achieved break-even this year—7,350 florins in revenue against 7,200 in costs. But the ceramics situation in Málaga remains critical. Ibrahim al-Fakhkhar grows no younger, and the golden luster technique dies with him unless we find a solution.\"\n\n\nDiego rolls up the document.\n\n\n\"What are Your Majesty's instructions?\"\n\nFile: /mnt/user-data/outputs/Castile_1437_Finances_Complete.xlsx",

In the early 1400s, the florin was worth about 22 sous tournois (just over one livre tournois)\n2. France's royal revenue in the 1430s was severely limited by the Hundred Years' War - Charles VII controlled only a fraction of France (\"the King of Bourges\")\n3. By the late 1450s/early 1460s, after Charles VII reconquered most of France, the taille became permanent (1439) and French revenues expanded significantly\n4. Later data shows taille bringing in about 20 million livres annually (by the 18th century)\n5. The conversion rate around 1400 was roughly 1 florin ≈ 22 sous tournois ≈ 1.1 livres tournois\n\nLet me provide Diego's informed response based on historical knowledge about French royal finances in the 1430s.\n\n\nDiego considers the question carefully, drawing on his knowledge of European affairs.\n\n\n\"An interesting comparison, Your Majesty. But we must be careful about what we mean by 'France at full strength.'\"\n\n\nHe pulls out a fresh sheet to sketch some figures.\n\n\n\n\"In 1437, Charles VII is still the 'King of Bourges'—he controls perhaps a third of France. The English and their Burgundian allies hold Normandy, much of the north, and Paris itself. The Hundred Years' War has devastated French revenues.\"\n\n\n\"At full strength—which is to say, before the wars began under Philip VI, or perhaps after Charles VII reconquers his kingdom in the late 1450s—France at peace might command revenues of 1.5 to 2 million livres tournois annually. The currency conversion is imprecise, but in this period one florin is worth roughly one livre tournois, perhaps slightly more given French debasement during the wars.\"\n\n\n\"So France united and at peace might see revenues comparable to or somewhat higher than Your Majesty's combined crowns—perhaps 1.5 to 2 million florins equivalent. But France today? Charles VII struggles to raise 500,000 livres from his diminished realm, and much of that goes to mercenary companies who barely obey him.\"\n\n\n\nDiego sets down his quill with evident satisfaction.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty commands revenues exceeding 750,000 florins annually from three crowns, plus growing income from Constantinople and Africa. You have a treasury exceeding one million florins. Charles VII has neither—his treasury is perpetually empty, his soldiers unpaid, his kingdom divided.\"\n\n\n\"The comparison that matters is not France at some theoretical full strength, but the powers that actually exist today. England's royal revenues are perhaps 100,000-150,000 pounds sterling—roughly 400,000-600,000 florins equivalent. The Duke of Burgundy, controlling the wealthy Low Countries, likely commands 300,000-400,000 florins. Milan under the Visconti perhaps 400,000-500,000 florins. Venice's revenues are substantial—perhaps 800,000-1,000,000 ducats when you include their colonial empire.\"\n\n\n\"Your Majesty now commands resources comparable to Venice, the wealthiest Christian state in the Mediterranean. Only the Ottoman Sultan, with revenues perhaps exceeding 2 million ducats from his vast domains, clearly surpasses you.\"\n\n\n\nHe pauses, then adds a note of caution.\n\n\n\"Of course, revenue is not the same as military power. France's feudal levies, when Charles VII can finally call them, will dwarf anything Your Majesty can field. Venice's revenues support a merchant fleet that doubles as a war fleet. And the Sultan's revenues support an army that conquered Constantinople in our grandfathers' time—though Your Majesty has undone that conquest.\"\n\n\n\"Still, in terms of liquid wealth available to the crown? Your Majesty is among the five or six wealthiest monarchs in Christendom. And your treasury grows while others struggle with debt.\"\n\n\nHe allows himself a small smile.\n\n\n\"Rich indeed, Your Majesty. Rich enough to change the world, if spent wisely.\"",

A severe winter storm catches the royal fleet in open water. Ships are scattered or damaged. Roll again: 1-50 = Juan's ship survives but is driven far off course, arriving weeks late after sheltering in Sardinia or Corsica; 51-85 = The ship is damaged and limps into the nearest port, requiring repairs and a month's delay; 86-100 = The unthinkable—the ship founders. Juan survives by reaching a lifeboat but loses men, treasure, and nearly his life. He arrives in Toledo shaken, with a tale that will become legend.\n4-8\nSerious storm damage. Winter gales batter the fleet. One or more escort vessels are lost or forced to turn back. Juan's ship survives but the journey takes twice as long as expected, with extended stops for repairs. He arrives exhausted and weather-worn in late January. The experience reinforces the dangers of winter sailing.\n9-15\nIllness strikes. The combination of winter travel, shipboard conditions, and exhaustion takes its toll. Juan develops a fever, chest congestion, or other ailment. He must rest for 1-2 weeks at an intermediate port (Barcelona, Valencia, or Zaragoza) before continuing. He arrives in Toledo weakened, requiring time to recover. Lucia is alarmed but relieved when he finally appears.\n16-22\nDelayed by weather. Contrary winds and winter storms force the fleet to shelter repeatedly—in Sardinia, Majorca, then Valencia. The journey takes a full month. Juan arrives frustrated by the delays but otherwise well. He has had time to think and plan, but also time to worry about events at home.\n23-30\nMinor difficulties. Some combination of weather delays, minor illness, or logistical problems slows the journey. Juan arrives in Toledo about a week later than hoped, in early January. He is tired but healthy, eager to see Lucia and meet his new daughter.\n31-45\nUneventful journey. The winter weather cooperates reasonably well. The fleet makes good time to Barcelona, and the overland journey proceeds without incident. Juan arrives in Toledo in late December or very early January, approximately as expected. A routine journey—the best outcome one can reasonably expect in winter.\n46-60\nSmooth sailing. Unusually favorable winter weather—clear skies, steady winds from the east. The fleet reaches Barcelona in excellent time. The overland journey is cold but the roads are passable. Juan arrives in Toledo before the new year, earlier than expected. Lucia is delighted; he is present for the first days of Princess Juana's life.\n61-70\nGood journey with useful encounters. The voyage goes well, and Juan uses the time productively. Perhaps he meets with Sardinian or Majorcan officials during a brief stop, or encounters Venetian or Genoese merchants with useful intelligence. He arrives in Toledo on schedule, refreshed rather than exhausted, with new information or connections.\n71-80\nExcellent passage with good news. The journey is swift and comfortable. Better still, messengers meet Juan en route with welcome news—perhaps strong tax receipts from one of his realms, successful completion of a project, or positive reports about the Constantinople settlement. He arrives in Toledo in high spirits, bearing gifts from Naples for Lucia and the children.\n81-88\nSwift journey, warm reception. Exceptional weather allows rapid passage. The fleet arrives in Barcelona to cheering crowds—word of the three crowns has spread, and Catalans celebrate their new king. The overland journey becomes something of a triumphal procession. Juan arrives in Toledo before Christmas, in time to celebrate the birth of Princess Juana with proper ceremony.\n89-94\nTriumphant return. Everything aligns perfectly. Swift seas, clear skies, enthusiastic welcomes at every port and city. Juan's journey becomes a celebration of the unified crowns. Nobles and officials along the route present themselves to swear allegiance. He arrives in Toledo to find Lucia recovering well, Princess Juana healthy, and the children excited to see their father. The court prepares a magnificent welcome.\n95-98\nBlessed passage. The journey is not merely smooth but seemingly touched by providence. Perfect weather, favorable winds, joyous receptions everywhere. Churchmen along the route speak of divine favor on the king who saved Constantinople and united the crowns. Juan arrives in Toledo to find wonderful news—perhaps the Mali expedition has sent word of success, or Constantinople reports exceptional growth, or some long-sought diplomatic objective has been achieved. He celebrates the new year as master of an empire that grows stronger by the day.\n99-100\nMiraculous journey. Against all odds for winter travel, everything goes perfectly—and more. The voyage is swift and pleasant. But the true miracle awaits in Toledo: perhaps Lucia has recovered with unusual speed and strength, or one of the children has accomplished something remarkable, or word arrives of a breakthrough that seemed impossible—an enemy's conversion, an alliance sealed, a discovery made. Juan's return becomes a moment of crystallized fortune, remembered for years as the journey when God's favor was unmistakable.\n\n\nDiego sets down the table.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty should be prepared for delays—winter sailing is unpredictable. But the route is through your own waters, your own lands. Barring true misfortune, you should reach Toledo within a month.\"\n\n\n\"Roll when ready, Your Majesty.\"",

The Prince of Taranto and the assembled barons watch from the harbor walls—their new king departing for distant Castile, leaving Naples in the hands of the governor you will appoint.\n\n\nThe weather holds. Clear skies and steady easterly winds push the fleet westward at good speed. You pass Sardinia's craggy coastline on the third day, the island's Aragonese governor sending a small boat out with fresh provisions and pledges of loyalty. By the sixth day, Majorca's familiar silhouette appears on the horizon.\n\n\nThe crossing from Majorca to Barcelona takes two days of easy sailing. The winter sun is weak but the seas are calm—the old sailors mutter about luck, about God's favor on the king who saved Constantinople. You arrive in Barcelona's harbor to find the city draped in the colors of both Aragon and Castile. Word of your coronation in Naples has preceded you; the Consell de Cent has organized a modest but genuine welcome.\n\n\nYou do not linger. Fresh horses are waiting, and the road to Toledo calls.\n\n\n\nThe overland journey is cold—January in the Spanish highlands offers no warmth—but the roads are clear of snow and the relay stations well-supplied. Your party makes good time through Zaragoza, where you pause only a single night to receive the Justicia's formal congratulations on the Neapolitan succession.\n\n\nYou cross into Castile on the feast of the Epiphany. The familiar landscape of the meseta spreads before you, brown and vast under the winter sky. By nightfall, Toledo's towers are visible on the horizon, the Tagus glinting silver in the fading light.\n\n\n\nYou arrive at the Alcázar as the bells ring vespers.\n\n\nQueen Lucia is waiting.\n\n\nShe stands in the great hall, thinner than when you left but with color in her cheeks and strength in her bearing. In her arms, wrapped in white linen embroidered with the lions of León and the castles of Castile, lies Princess Juana—three weeks old, dark-haired like her mother, sleeping peacefully despite the commotion of your arrival.\n\n\nThe children crowd around—Fernando demanding to know about the ships, Catalina asking about Naples with the precise questions of a girl who has been studying maps, little Bianca and Teresa simply happy to see their father. The household staff struggles to maintain decorum as the king embraces his family.\n\n\nLucia looks up at you, the infant between you.\n\n\n\"Three crowns now,\" she says quietly, a hint of her old humor beneath the exhaustion of recent childbirth. \"I hope you remembered which one fits.\"\n\n\n\nDate: January 7, 1438\nLocation: Toledo, Alcázar\nTreasury: ~1,057,851 florins (year-end 1437)\nStatus: Reunited with family; Princess Juana healthy; Queen Lucia recovering well\n\n\nThe court awaits your instructions, Your Majesty.

      "text": "Thought process: Calibrated historically accurate childbirth outcomes reflecting medieval mortality rates.\n\nThe user wants to roll for the outcome of Lucia's childbirth - Princess Juana. This is a very serious matter in medieval times. Childbirth was extremely dangerous in the 15th century. I need to create a historically accurate d100 table that reflects the real dangers of childbirth in this period.\n\nLet me research what I know about medieval childbirth mortality:\n- Maternal mortality in medieval/early modern Europe was roughly 1-2% per birth for wealthy women with good care\n- Infant mortality was much higher - perhaps 20-30% in the first year, with a significant portion in the first days/weeks\n- Noble women generally had better outcomes due to access to midwives, nutrition, and rest\n- Lucia has already successfully delivered five children (Fernando, Catalina, Bianca, Teresa, and now Juana), which is both good (proven fertility, experienced) and potentially concerning (cumulative strain on the body)\n- She's been described as recovering well, but the user wants to actually roll for this\n\nWait - the narrative already established that Juana was born and Lucia is recovering. The user wants to retroactively roll for the outcome. I should create a table that could result in tragedy (historically accurate) but also reflects that:\n1. Lucia has successfully delivered five previous children\n2. She has access to the best care available\n3. She's a healthy woman in her prime (she was born around 1410, so she's about 27-28)\n\nActually, looking at the context - Princess Juana is described as already born and healthy, and Lucia is recovering. But the user wants to make this properly uncertain with a roll. This is good - it maintains the historical realism where nothing is guaranteed.\n\nLet me create a table that reflects:\n- Maternal mortality rate of roughly 1-3% for well-cared-for noble women\n- Infant mortality (at birth or shortly after) of perhaps 10-15% for nobility\n- Various complications that could affect recovery\n- The very real possibility of losing one or both\n \nThe harsh reality of medieval childbirth demands a nuanced approach. Historical records reveal the precarious nature of birthing, where even royal women faced significant risks. Queens and noblewomen were not immune to the deadly complications that could arise during or after childbirth. The medical knowledge of the time was limited, making every pregnancy a potential life-or-death event.\n\nI'll assess the potential outcomes, considering Lucia's favorable circumstances. Her youth, previous successful births, and access to quality medical care significantly improve her chances. The probability spectrum ranges from challenging scenarios to remarkably positive outcomes, reflecting the complex medical landscape of the era.\n\n\nDiego pauses, his expression growing grave.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty raises a matter that should never be taken for granted. Childbirth is the battlefield where women prove their courage—and too many do not return from it.\"\n\n\nHe sets aside the financial documents and pulls out a fresh sheet.\n\n\n\"Queen Lucia is young, healthy, and has delivered five children successfully. She has the finest midwives, physicians, and care that wealth can provide. These are advantages. But advantages are not guarantees. Queens die in childbed as surely as peasant women. Your own grandmother, Catherine of Lancaster, nearly died delivering your father.\"\n\n\n\nChildbirth Outcome - Queen Lucia and Princess Juana\n\n\nContext\n\n\nMother: Queen Lucia of Trastámara, age 27-28\nPrevious births: Five successful deliveries (Fernando, Catalina, Bianca, Teresa, and one other)\nCare available: Royal physicians, experienced midwives, best nutrition and rest\nLocation: Toledo Alcázar, with full household support\nDate: Late November/Early December 1437\n\n\n\nFactors Favoring Good Outcome\n\n\nYouth and health: Lucia is in her prime childbearing years\n\nProven fertility: Five previous successful births demonstrate her body handles pregnancy well\n\nExcellent care: The finest midwives and physicians in Castile attend her\n\nGood nutrition: No risk of the malnutrition that kills peasant mothers\n\nRest and support: A full household to attend her every need\n\nExperience: Both Lucia and her attendants know what to expect\n\n\nFactors Creating Risk\n\n\nCumulative strain: Six pregnancies in roughly eight years takes a toll on the body\n\nWinter birth: Cold weather increases risk of fever and infection\n\nMedical limitations: Even the best 15th-century medicine cannot address hemorrhage or severe infection\n\nUnpredictable complications: Breech presentation, cord problems, or other emergencies can strike anyone\n\nChildbed fever: The great killer of mothers, poorly understood and essentially untreatable\n\nInfant fragility: Even healthy-seeming newborns can sicken and die in their first weeks\n\n\n\nD100 Table: Childbirth Outcome\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-2\nCatastrophe. The birth goes terribly wrong—hemorrhage, infection, or other disaster. Despite all efforts, both mother and child are lost. Castile is plunged into mourning. Juan must raise five children alone and face the question of remarriage for the succession. The court is devastated; priests speak of Job's trials.\n3-5\nMother lost. The birth itself succeeds, but childbed fever or hemorrhage claims Lucia in the days that follow. Princess Juana survives, a living reminder of her mother's sacrifice. Juan is a widower with six children. The realm mourns a beloved queen; the question of succession and remarriage becomes urgent.\n6-10\nChild lost. The birth is difficult. Princess Juana is born weak, struggles to breathe, or fails to thrive in her first days. Despite the midwives' efforts, she slips away. Lucia survives but is grief-stricken and weakened. The court mourns quietly; infant death is common but no less painful. Lucia will need months to recover, physically and emotionally.\n11-18\nSerious complications, both survive. A dangerous birth—perhaps breech presentation, prolonged labor, or significant bleeding. Both mother and child survive, but Lucia is severely weakened. She will be bedridden for months and may never fully recover her former strength. Physicians quietly suggest that another pregnancy could kill her. Princess Juana is healthy but her mother's fragility casts a shadow.\n19-28\nDifficult birth, slow recovery. Labor is long and painful. Lucia loses significant blood or develops a mild fever that lingers for weeks. Princess Juana is healthy, but Lucia's recovery takes months. She is weak through the winter and spring, unable to participate fully in court life. By summer she should be restored, but the experience has aged her.\n29-40\nHard but successful. A difficult labor lasting many hours, exhausting for mother and attendants alike. But both emerge healthy. Lucia is tired and sore, recovering slowly through December and January. Princess Juana is small but vigorous. By February, Lucia is back on her feet; by spring, fully recovered. A birth that reminds everyone of the dangers, but with a happy ending.\n41-55\nNormal birth. The delivery proceeds as well as can be expected—painful, frightening, but without serious complication. Lucia labors for several hours and delivers a healthy daughter. She is exhausted but recovering normally. Princess Juana nurses well and gains weight. Within six weeks, Lucia is moving about the palace; within three months, fully restored. The routine miracle of successful childbirth.\n56-70\nGood outcome. A relatively easy labor by the standards of the time. Lucia's experience shows—she knows what to expect, her body responds well. Princess Juana is born healthy and strong, crying lustily. Lucia recovers quickly, walking within two weeks, resuming light duties within a month. The midwives pronounce it one of the easiest royal births they have attended.\n71-82\nExcellent outcome. Everything goes smoothly. Labor is shorter than expected, delivery uncomplicated. Princess Juana is a beautiful, healthy infant who feeds eagerly. Lucia recovers with remarkable speed, her natural vitality reasserting itself. Within weeks she is attending to correspondence; within two months she is fully active. The physicians credit her youth, her constitution, and God's grace.\n83-92\nSwift and healthy. An unusually easy birth. Lucia labors only a few hours before delivering a robust daughter. She barely bleeds, develops no fever, and is sitting up and eating within a day. Princess Juana is healthy from her first breath—good color, strong lungs, eager to nurse. The midwives marvel; the priests give thanks. Lucia is restored to full health before Juan even returns from Naples.\n93-97\nBlessed delivery. The birth seems touched by grace. Brief labor, easy delivery, immediate recovery. Princess Juana is perfect—healthy, beautiful, calm. Lucia feels better within days than she has after any previous birth. She attributes it to prayer, to the intercession of the Virgin, to God's favor on the house of Trastámara. The household celebrates; the queen's strength is undiminished. Some whisper that God smiles on the king who saved Constantinople.\n98-100\nMiraculous. Against all expectations for a sixth birth, everything is not merely good but exceptional. Lucia delivers quickly and painlessly—she later describes feeling almost no distress. Princess Juana is the healthiest of all her children, thriving from the first moment. Lucia recovers so rapidly that she is managing household affairs within a week, as if the birth barely occurred. Physicians cannot explain it; priests speak of divine intervention. The birth becomes a sign and a wonder, proof of God's blessing on the royal house.\n\n\nDiego sets down his quill.\n\n\n\"These are the odds as honestly as I can reckon them, Your Majesty. Queen Lucia has every advantage—but childbirth respects no crown. I have seen great ladies die and peasant women thrive, and the reverse, with no logic to explain it.\"\n\n\n\"The Church teaches that women approach childbirth as men approach battle—uncertain of return. We can only pray.\"\n\n\n\"Roll when ready, Your Majesty. And may God be merciful.\"",

But the user says this is her 4th pregnancy. Let me reconsider.\n\nActually, looking back at the memories and context:\n- Juan was previously married to Isabel, who died. Isabel likely had some of the children.\n- Lucia is Juan's second wife.\n\nSo the children might be split between the two marriages:\n- Isabel's children: Catalina (the eldest), possibly others\n- Lucia's children: The younger ones\n\nIf Juana is Lucia's 4th pregnancy, then Lucia has had 3 previous children. The older children (like Catalina who is nearly 6) would be from Isabel.\n\nLet me adjust my response to acknowledge this correction and narrate the outcome of a roll of 44, which falls in the \"Normal birth\" category (41-55).\n\nA normal birth - painful, frightening, but without serious complication.

The hours stretch on as they always do, each contraction a small battle. Lucia grips the hands of her attendants, calls on the Virgin, endures what women have endured since Eve.\n\n\nBy evening, it is done.\n\n\nPrincess Juana enters the world crying—a good sign, the midwives say. She is small but well-formed, with dark hair like her mother and a surprisingly strong grip. The cord is cut, the afterbirth delivered, the bleeding controlled. Lucia is exhausted, drenched in sweat, but alive. The worst danger has passed.\n\n\n\nThe days that follow bring the lesser fears. Will fever come? Will the milk flow? Will the child thrive?\n\n\nGod is merciful. Lucia develops no infection. Princess Juana nurses eagerly, gaining weight as a healthy infant should. The queen sleeps much, eats well, and slowly regains her strength.\n\n\nBy Christmas, Lucia is sitting up and receiving visitors. By Epiphany—when Juan arrives from Naples—she is walking, still pale and tired, but unmistakably recovering.

Let me compile all the information about the children from these sources:\n\n1. **Prince Fernando** - Born August 3, 1433 (from first wife Queen Isabel who died in childbirth)\n   - Son of Juan II and Queen Isabel\n   - Age in January 1438: 4 years old\n   - Traits: Need to check if rolled\n   - Notable: Grabbed Juan's beard on reunion; described as sincere in his piety (Roll 35 - acceptable performance at Cortes)\n\n2. **Princess Catalina** - Born January 28, 1432 (from first wife Queen Isabel)\n   - Daughter of Juan II and Queen Isabel (traumatic breech birth)\n   - Age in January 1438: Nearly 6 years old\n   - Survival Roll: 73 - Survives childhood\n   - Intelligence: 87 - Brilliant\n   - Temperament: 76 - Commanding\n   - Special Talent: Voice (Roll 34 → 5) - Sings like an angel\n   - Piety: 7 - Indifferent (cruel irony - beautiful voice, no faith)\n   - Beauty: 70 - Beautiful\n   - Notable: Legendary debut at Cortes (Roll 96), saved a boy during Constantinople journey (?), \"No. Catalina helping\", called Lucia \"Lucia-mama\"\n\n3. **Princess Bianca** - Born September 14, 1434 (from second wife Queen Lucia)\n   - Daughter of Juan II and Queen Lucia\n   - Age in January 1438: 3 years old\n   - Survival Roll: 24 - Survives but fragile (serious illness will leave constitution weakened)\n   - Other traits: Not yet rolled\n   - Notable: Born in Naples during journey\n\n4. **Princess Teresa** - Born September 19, 1435 (from Queen Lucia)\n   - Daughter of Juan II and Queen Lucia\n   - Age in January 1438: 2 years old\n   - Named for Saint Teresa of Portugal\n   - Traits: Not yet rolled\n\n5. **Princess Juana** - Born late 1437 (from Queen Lucia)\n   - Daughter of Juan II and Queen Lucia\n   - Age in January 1438: ~2 months old\n   - Traits: Not yet rolled\n\n6. **New Son** - Born late 1437 (we just rolled - Roll 92, it's a son!)\n   - Son of Juan II and Queen Lucia\n\nI'll focus on the two youngest children and the newly discovered son. Teresa, just 2 years old, carries the name of a Portuguese saint. Juana is merely two months old, while the newest addition is a son born in late 1437 with an impressive Roll 92. Both Teresa and Juana have yet to have their traits fully explored, leaving potential for future development in the family lineage.\n\nThe family now comprises six children: two from Isabel and four from Lucia. This growing royal family suggests a robust and expanding dynastic presence. I'm intrigued by the potential story behind Catalina's reported heroism during the Constantinople journey, which seems to hint at a compelling narrative waiting to be uncovered.\n\n\nLet me search for more details about Catalina's heroic act and any other trait information.\n\n\nTool: Searching project",

      "text": "1. **Prince Fernando** (son of Juan and Queen Isabel)\n- Born: August 3, 1433\n- Age in January 1438: 4 years old\n- Heir to the throne, Prince of Asturias\n- From the search results, I see mentions of Fernando but I need to find his trait rolls\n\n2. **Princess Catalina** (daughter of Juan and Queen Isabel)\n- Born: January 28, 1432\n- Age in January 1438: Nearly 6 years old (will turn 6 on January 28, 1438)\n- Mother Isabel died in childbirth with Fernando\n- TRAITS ROLLED (from Chapter_2_16_Summary.md):\n  - Survival Roll: 73 — Survives Childhood\n  - Intelligence: 87 — Brilliant\n  - Temperament: 76 — Commanding\n  - Special Talent: Voice (Roll: 34 → 5) — Sings like an angel\n  - Piety: 7 — Indifferent (a heartbreak for her father)\n  - Beauty: 70 — Beautiful\n- Notable events:\n  - The Fraga Incident - saved a drowning boy (Tomás) at age not-yet-2 by throwing him a rope\n  - Called \"La Princesita de la Cuerda\"\n  - A shrine was built: La Capilla de la Princesita\n  - Legendary debut at Cortes (Roll: 96)\n  - Extraordinary singing voice discovered\n\n3. **Princess Bianca** (daughter of Juan and Queen Lucia)\n- Born: September 14, 1434 in Naples\n- Age in January 1438: 3 years old\n- TRAITS: From search results - Survival Roll: 24 — Survives but fragile—serious illness will leave constitution weakened\n \nI continue tracking the royal lineage with two more young princesses. Teresa, born in September 1435, is just 2 years old and named after Saint Teresa of Portugal. No traits have been determined for her yet. Her sister Juana, born in late 1437, is merely 1-2 months old, with a normal birth roll of 44. Both are daughters of Juan and Queen Lucia, expanding the royal family's next generation.\n\nThe current focus is on determining the details of Lucia's fourth pregnancy. Previous children include Fernando and Catalina from Isabel, and Bianca from Lucia. I'm carefully reviewing the conversation to ensure accurate tracking of the royal births and lineage.\n\nThe latest information confirms Teresa as Lucia's second child, born September 19, 1435, and we've just rolled for the gender of her fourth pregnancy, which resulted in a son. This aligns with the summary noting Lucia's second child as Juan's fourth overall child.\n\nChecking historical records shows Bianca was born in September/October 1434, and she was noted as fragile but expected to survive. The sequence of children is becoming clearer, with each birth carefully documented and verified.\n\nThe upcoming pregnancy due in November/December 1436 appears to be for Juana, marking Lucia's third pregnancy. This matches the transcript summary mentioning Juana as Juan's sixth child overall.\n\nThe family's timeline now includes six children: two with Isabel and four with Lucia. The most recent addition is a son born in late 1437, which would be Lucia's fourth pregnancy. By January 1438, the children's ages range from newborn to nearly 6 years old, with Catalina being the eldest and Juana being the newest family member.\n\nCatalina stands out with impressive traits: high survival and intelligence scores, moderate temperament, voice talent, and notable beauty. Fernando's performance and traits are less clear, though the user mentions having rolled for both eldest children. I'll need to confirm his specific trait details.\n\nThe chapter summary reveals intriguing insights about their religious perception. While Catalina's performance was legendary, Fernando's was acceptable. Notably, Fray Tomás de Torquemada specifically praised Fernando's genuine faith, contrasting with Catalina's apparent religious indifference.\n\nI'll focus on gathering more precise information about Fernando's traits and preparing to document the traits for the younger children.\n\nA wise decision, Your Majesty. Let me compile everything we know about the royal children.\n\nTHE CHILDREN OF KING JUAN II OF CASTILE\n\nAs of January 1438\n\nCHILDREN OF QUEEN ISABEL OF PORTUGAL (d. 1433)\n\n1. PRINCESS CATALINA OF CASTILE\n\nBorn: January 28, 1432 (traumatic breech birth)\n\nAge in January 1438: 5 years old (turns 6 on January 28)\n\nMother: Queen Isabel of Portugal (died August 3, 1433)\n\nSURVIVAL ROLL: 73 — Survives Childhood\nDespite the era's high mortality, Catalina will survive to adulthood.\n\nTRAITS ROLLED:\n\nTrait\nRoll\nResult\nIntelligence\n87\nBrilliant — Exceptional mind; reads before age 4, masters Latin by 8; grasps complex political situations intuitively; remembers conversations verbatim\nTemperament\n76\nCommanding — Natural authority that makes people defer without knowing why; does not demand obedience, assumes it\nSpecial Talent\n34→5\nVoice — Sings like an angel; clear, pure, extraordinary range; silences rooms\nPiety\n7\nIndifferent — Goes through motions of faith without feeling; God is a word, not a presence; will learn to perform devotion convincingly. A particular heartbreak for her father.\nBeauty\n70\nBeautiful — Genuine beauty that draws eyes across crowded halls; dark hair like her mother Isabel\n\nNOTABLE EVENTS:\n\nThe Fraga Incident (January 1434): At not-yet-two years old, wandered to a bridge where a 4-year-old boy named Tomás was drowning. Picked up a fisherman's rope, threw it to him, and held on while men pulled him out. When they tried to take the rope: \"No. Catalina helping.\" Called \"La Princesita de la Cuerda\" — a shrine was built (La Capilla de la Princesita). Tomás became a priest and told the story until his death.\n\nCortes Debut (1436): Roll 96 — Legendary. The four-year-old became the talk of the realm.\n\nSinging Discovery: King Duarte of Portugal said: \"Voices like that are given once in a generation.\"\n\nThe Cruel Irony: Her voice is the most beautiful instrument of sacred music in Castile. When she sings the Salve Regina, grown men weep. And she feels nothing.\n\n2. PRINCE FERNANDO OF CASTILE, Prince of Asturias\n\nBorn: August 3, 1433\n\nAge in January 1438: 4 years old (turns 5 in August)\n\nMother: Queen Isabel of Portugal (died giving birth to him)\n\nStatus: Heir to the throne\n\nSURVIVAL ROLL: (Need to confirm from user)\n\nTRAITS ROLLED: (Need to confirm from user — user stated traits were rolled for both eldest children)\n\nKNOWN CHARACTERISTICS:\n\nHas Isabel's features but will never know his mother\n\nGenuine, sincere piety (unlike Catalina's performed devotion)\n\nFray Tomás de Torquemada approved of Fernando's genuine faith\n\nAt Cortes 1436 (Roll 35): Overshadowed by Catalina but clergy impressed by sincere faith\n\nCheerful disposition; eats everything\n\nGrabbed Juan's beard upon first meeting after Constantinople journey\n\nCHILDREN OF QUEEN LUCIA D'ESTE\n\n3.

Temperament: 64 — **Bold**\n3. Martial Aptitude: 9 — **Reluctant** (prefers books to blades, violence unsettles him)\n4. Special Talent: 76 — **Languages** (extraordinary linguistic gift)\n5. Piety: 50 — **Sincere** (genuine quiet faith)\n6. Physical Presence: 87 — **Magnificent** (tall, broad-shouldered, looks like a future warrior-king)\n\nAnd his survival was confirmed - he survives childhood.\n\nNow I have Catalina's traits as well:\n1. Intelligence: 87 — **Brilliant**\n2. Temperament: 76 — **Commanding**\n3. Special Talent: 34 — **Voice** (singing)\n4. Piety: 7 — **Indifferent** (goes through motions but no real faith)\n5. Beauty: 70 — **Beautiful**\n\nAnd for Catalina, there was also a Survival Roll: 73 — Survives Childhood\n\nNow I need to create the trait tables for Bianca. Since Bianca already has her survival roll (24 — Survives but fragile), we need to roll her other traits.\n\nFor the trait tables, I should use the same categories. Since Bianca is a girl like Catalina, I should use similar tables. Let me adapt them for Bianca:\n\n1. Intelligence\n2. Temperament\n3. Special Talent\n4. Piety\n5. Beauty\n\nThese are the same tables used for Catalina.\n\nExcellent! I found Fernando's traits from our earlier session. Here is the complete picture:\n\nPRINCE FERNANDO — CONFIRMED TRAITS\n\nRolls from Chapter 2.40:\n\nTrait\nRoll\nResult\nIntelligence\n82\nBrilliant — Exceptional mind; absorbs knowledge like dry earth drinks rain; will correct scribes' Latin by age 10\nTemperament\n64\nBold — Speaks his mind, acts decisively, meets the world with confidence; does not flinch from difficult conversations\nMartial Aptitude\n9\nReluctant — The shadow on the heir. The sword feels wrong in his hand. Violence unsettles him. Prefers books to blades. Squires younger than him will unhorse him in the lists.\nSpecial Talent\n76\nLanguages — Extraordinary gift. Castilian, Latin, Portuguese, Catalan by 12. Italian, French, Greek by 16. Arabic phrases from converted scholars.\nPiety\n50\nSincere — Genuine, quiet faith. Prays because prayer matters to him. This comforts Juan immensely where Catalina's emptiness wounds him.\nPhysical Presence\n87\nMagnificent — Tall, broad-shouldered, strong-limbed. Looks like everything a medieval king should be. The cruelest irony: the magnificent body houses a scholar's soul.\n\nSurvival: Confirmed survives childhood.\n\nNow, let us roll for Princess Bianca. I will use the same tables we used for Catalina.\n\nPRINCESS BIANCA — TRAIT ROLLS\n\nBianca was born September 14, 1434 in Naples. She is Lucia's first child. We already know her survival roll: 24 — Survives but Fragile (a serious illness will weaken her constitution permanently).\n\n1. INTELLIGENCE\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-10\nSimple. Sweet-natured but slow. Struggles with letters and numbers.\n11-25\nAverage. Learns what she must, no more. Practical rather than scholarly.\n26-50\nCapable. Quick enough to manage a household, understand politics, hold conversation.\n51-75\nSharp. Learns languages easily, grasps complex situations, reads people well.\n76-90\nBrilliant. Exceptional mind. Could match scholars in debate if permitted.\n91-100\nExtraordinary. Generational intellect. Remembers everything, sees patterns others miss.\n\n2. TEMPERAMENT\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-15\nVolatile. Passionate but unpredictable. Great heights and terrible depths.\n16-30\nStubborn. Immovable once decided. A strength and a flaw.\n31-50\nSteady. Reliable, even-keeled. Perhaps unexciting, but dependable.\n51-70\nSpirited. Energetic, bold, confident. Fills a room when she enters.\n71-85\nCommanding. Natural authority. People follow her without knowing why.\n86-100\nMagnetic. That rare quality that draws loyalty and devotion effortlessly.\n\n3. SPECIAL TALENT\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-15\nNone particular. Competent at many things, exceptional at nothing.\n16-30\nNeedlework/Art. Exceptional skill with needle, brush, or pen. Creates beauty.\n31-45\nMusic. Voice or instrument—she has the gift.\n46-60\nLanguages. Picks up tongues effortlessly.\n61-75\nDiplomacy. Reads people, navigates politics, builds alliances.\n76-85\nHealing/Herbcraft. Natural understanding of medicine and remedies.\n86-95\nLetters/Scholarship. A mind for books, theology, philosophy.\n96-100\nMultiple gifts. Roll twice more, she has both.\n\n4. PIETY\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-15\nIndifferent. Goes through motions. Faith is politics, nothing more.\n16-35\nConventional. Believes as expected. Neither fervent nor doubting.\n36-60\nSincere. Genuine faith that guides but does not dominate.\n61-80\nDevout. Deep spiritual life. Prayer matters to her.\n81-95\nFervent. Faith burns bright. May seek religious life or crusading spirit.\n96-100\nMystic. Visions, certainty, direct connection to the divine—or believes so.\n\n5. BEAUTY\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-10\nPlain. Unremarkable features. Must rely on other qualities.\n11-25\nPleasant. Agreeable enough. No one stares, no one looks away.\n26-50\nAttractive. Pretty in the way of healthy, well-bred nobility.\n51-75\nBeautiful. Draws eyes. Poets will write verses.\n76-90\nStunning. The kind of beauty that starts wars and ends dynasties.\n91-100\nLegendary. Remembered for centuries. Helen of Troy.

Let me draft an adjusted table that reflects this genetic advantage.\n\nI should also note that Bianca's survival roll of 24 means she'll be fragile - illness may affect her appearance somewhat, but her genetic heritage should still shine through.\n\nLet me create a weighted table that accounts for:\n1. Lucia's legendary beauty (major factor)\n2. Juan's above-average looks (minor positive factor)\n3. The fact that illness/fragility might slightly diminish her appearance\n\nThe original table had:\n1-10: Plain\n11-25: Pleasant\n26-50: Attractive\n51-75: Beautiful\n76-90: Stunning\n91-100: Legendary\n\nFor Bianca, given her mother's legendary beauty, I should shift these ranges significantly upward. Perhaps:\n- Near-impossible for her to be plain\n- Very unlikely to be merely pleasant\n- The floor should be \"attractive\" at minimum\n- Higher chances of beautiful, stunning, or even legendary\n\nLet me draft this appropriately.\n\nA wise consideration, Your Majesty. Bianca's parentage strongly favors beauty.\n\nLucia d'Este was described upon her introduction as possessing legendary beauty—the kind that draws ambassadors' reports and poets' verses across Italy. She was chosen in part because her beauty would grace any court in Christendom.\n\nJuan II is of above-average appearance—not legendary, but a handsome king who cuts a fine figure.\n\nWith such parentage—particularly a mother of extraordinary beauty—the dice should be weighted accordingly. A child of Lucia d'Este being plain would require remarkably unfortunate fortune.\n\nPRINCESS BIANCA — BEAUTY (Adjusted for Parentage)\n\nDaughter of Queen Lucia d'Este (legendary beauty) and King Juan II (above-average). However, we must also consider that Bianca's survival roll (24) indicates future illness will weaken her constitution—this may affect her appearance over time, lending a fragile, delicate quality rather than robust beauty.\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-5\nDelicate but Plain. The illness that will mark her life has already touched her features. She has her mother's bone structure but something is... muted. Pleasant enough, but none of Lucia's fire.\n6-15\nPrettily Fragile. Attractive in a pale, ethereal way. Men feel protective rather than dazzled. Her mother's beauty filtered through a veil of frailty.\n16-35\nBeautiful but Wan. Lucia's features shine through clearly—the eyes, the cheekbones, the grace. But there is a translucent quality, a delicacy that speaks of candles burning too bright. Poets will write of tragic beauty.\n36-60\nBeautiful. Her mother's daughter, unmistakably. Dark Italian beauty that draws eyes across crowded halls. The fragility adds poignancy rather than diminishing her—she is lovely and men know she is precious.\n61-80\nStunning. Lucia's legendary beauty has passed to her daughter almost intact. Despite her delicate constitution, Bianca is breathtaking—the kind of beauty that makes men forget their words. Her fragility only makes her more captivating.\n81-95\nHeartbreaking Beauty. She has inherited the full measure of her mother's gifts. Combined with her fragile constitution, she becomes something almost painful to behold—exquisite and ephemeral, like a perfect flower that might wilt at any moment. Men will fall in love with her across crowded rooms. Marriage offers will flood the court.\n96-100\nLegendary. Against all odds, the fragile child grows into beauty that surpasses even her mother's. She becomes one of those women whose names echo through history—whose portraits are copied for centuries, whose face launches diplomatic crises. The contrast between her delicate health and her extraordinary beauty only deepens her mystique.\n\nRoll 1d100 for Bianca's Beauty, Your Majesty.",

First child of Queen Lucia d'Este.\n\nSURVIVAL: 24 — Survives but Fragile\n\nBianca will survive childhood, but a serious illness—perhaps the sweating sickness, perhaps a lung fever—will strike her in youth and leave her constitution permanently weakened. She will tire easily, catch colds that linger for weeks, and require careful management of her health throughout her life. Marriage negotiations will be complicated by whispered concerns about whether she can bear children safely.\n\nTRAITS\n\nTrait\nRoll\nResult\nIntelligence\n49\nCapable\nTemperament\n7\nVolatile\nSpecial Talent\n56\nLanguages\nPiety\n71\nDevout\nBeauty\n98\nLegendary\n\nTHE PORTRAIT\n\nIntelligence: 49 — Capable\n\nBianca is no fool, but neither does she possess her half-siblings' exceptional minds. She learns what she must—reading, writing, the management of a household, the basics of politics and diplomacy. She can hold intelligent conversation, understand complex situations when they are explained to her, and navigate court life competently. But where Catalina grasps things instantly and Fernando devours books, Bianca must work for her knowledge. She is practical rather than scholarly, sensible rather than brilliant.\n\nThis will not trouble her. There are other currencies in the world of courts and kingdoms.\n\nTemperament: 7 — Volatile\n\nHere is the storm within the delicate vessel.\n\nBianca feels everything intensely. Joy lifts her to heights of radiant happiness that light up entire rooms. Sorrow plunges her into depths of despair that worry her attendants. Anger—rare but terrible—flashes like summer lightning. She weeps easily, laughs easily, loves fiercely and hates with equal passion.\n\nHer fragile health makes this worse. When she is tired or unwell—which is often—her emotions become even more ungovernable. She will say things in anger that she regrets for years. She will make promises in joy that she cannot keep. She will fall in love suddenly and completely, and fall out of love just as quickly.\n\nManaging Bianca will require patience, understanding, and a steady hand. Her future husband will need to be either very calm or very absent.\n\nSpecial Talent: 56 — Languages\n\nLike her half-brother Fernando, Bianca has an ear for tongues. Italian from her mother, Castilian from her father's court, Latin from her tutors—and then French, Portuguese, Catalan, picked up with surprising ease. Where she struggles with philosophy or mathematics, languages simply arrive in her mind, as natural as breathing.\n\nThis gift will serve her well. A princess who can speak to foreign ambassadors in their own tongue, who can read correspondence without translators, who can charm visiting dignitaries with a few words in their native language—such a princess is valuable indeed.\n\nPiety: 71 — Devout\n\nPerhaps because of her fragile health, perhaps because of her volatile emotions, Bianca finds genuine solace in faith. She prays not merely because princesses must be seen to pray, but because prayer brings her peace. The rhythm of the liturgy calms her storms. The presence of God in the chapel is real to her—a comfort when her body fails her, an anchor when her emotions threaten to sweep her away.\n\nShe will be drawn to religious art, to sacred music (though she lacks Catalina's voice), to the lives of the saints. In darker moments, she may wonder if God is calling her to the religious life—but her father has other plans for a princess of Castile, and her legendary beauty will make such a calling difficult to pursue.\n\nHer confessor will become one of the most important figures in her life.\n\nBeauty: 98 — Legendary\n\nAnd here is the gift that will define her.\n\nAgainst all odds, the fragile child grows into beauty that surpasses even her mother's. Lucia d'Este was called the most beautiful woman in Italy; her daughter will be called the most beautiful woman in Christendom.\n\nIt is not merely prettiness. There is something almost otherworldly about Bianca—the dark Italian eyes, the perfect bone structure, the grace that persists even when she is pale and tired from illness. The contrast between her delicate constitution and her extraordinary beauty only deepens her mystique. She is exquisite and ephemeral, like a perfect rose that might wilt at any moment. Men feel an almost painful urge to protect her, to possess her, to simply look at her.\n\nBy the time she is fourteen, portraits will be requested by half the courts of Europe. By sixteen, marriage offers will flood Toledo from every kingdom that has heard of her. Poets will compose verses; troubadours will sing of \"the Flower of Castile\"; ambassadors will write detailed descriptions to their masters. Her face will complicate diplomacy, spark rivalries, and possibly—if her father is not careful—start wars.\n\nShe is Helen of Troy reborn in fragile flesh. And she knows it.\n\nTHE TRAGEDY\n\nThe cruelest irony of Bianca's life is written in her stars.\n\nShe is legendary beauty trapped in a fragile body. She is volcanic emotions trapped in a vessel that cannot sustain them. She is a princess whose face could win any husband in Christendom, but whose health makes every pregnancy a mortal risk.\n\nMen will want her desperately. And wanting her may destroy her.\n\nHer father will face an impossible choice: use her extraordinary beauty to forge the alliance of a lifetime, knowing that childbirth might kill her—or protect her from such a fate, wasting the most valuable diplomatic asset his dynasty possesses.\n\nBianca herself will feel this tension. Her volatile nature will rebel against being treated as fragile. Her devout faith will whisper that suffering is holy. Her capable mind will understand exactly what she is worth on the marriage market—and exactly what that market might cost her.\n\nShe is three years old now, playing with blocks in the nursery, unaware of the storm gathering around her future.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nAttribute\nDescription\nMind\nCapable but not exceptional; practical and sensible\nHeart\nVolatile; passionate heights and depths; needs careful management\nSpirit\nDevout; genuine faith provides anchor for turbulent emotions\nGift\nLanguages; picks up tongues with remarkable ease\nBody\nFragile constitution; will be marked by serious illness\nFace\nLegendary beauty; may be the most beautiful woman in Christendom\n\nCatalina is brilliant, commanding, and spiritually empty.

Godparents: Don Álvaro de Luna and the Countess of Alba.\n\nSURVIVAL ROLL\n\nChildhood in the 15th century is perilous. Disease, accident, and simple ill fortune claim many children before they reach adulthood. Even royal children with the best care available are not immune.\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-10\nDies in childhood. A fever, an accident, a sudden illness—Teresa does not survive to adulthood. The timing will be determined later.\n11-20\nSurvives but fragile. A serious illness leaves her constitution permanently weakened. Health concerns will shadow her life.\n21-35\nSurvives with difficulty. One or more serious illnesses, but she pulls through. Perhaps a visible mark—scarring from pox, a weakened limb.\n36-60\nSurvives normally. The usual childhood illnesses, but nothing exceptional. She reaches adulthood in reasonable health.\n61-80\nSurvives well. Hardy constitution. Illnesses pass quickly. Robust health into adulthood.\n81-100\nThrives. Exceptional health. Rarely sick, quick to recover. The kind of constitution that lives to old age.\n\nRoll 1d100 for Teresa's Survival, Your Majesty.\n\nOnce we have that, I will present the trait tables (with the modified beauty table reflecting Lucia's legendary beauty).",

She has inherited the robust constitution that sometimes skips generations—the kind of health that laughs at winter chills and shrugs off ailments that fell lesser children.\n\nShe will be the child who runs through rain without catching cold, who eats everything put before her, who sleeps soundly and wakes with energy. Physicians will rarely be summoned to her bedside. She will likely live to old age, God willing, and bear children without the dangers that will shadow Bianca's future.\n\nTwo sisters, born a year apart: one legendary beauty trapped in fragile flesh, one blessed with iron health. The dice have spoken.\n\nNow for her traits:\n\n1. INTELLIGENCE\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-10\nSimple. Sweet-natured but slow. Struggles with letters and numbers.\n11-25\nAverage.

Unlike Bianca, Teresa's exceptional health means her beauty will not be tempered by fragility—she may possess a more robust, vital attractiveness.\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-5\nPlain. Sometimes beauty skips entirely. Teresa has pleasant features but none of her mother's fire. She will be known for other qualities.\n6-15\nPleasant. Agreeable enough. Lucia's bone structure is there but muted. No one stares, no one looks away.\n16-35\nAttractive. Pretty in a healthy, vital way. Her robust constitution gives her rosy cheeks and bright eyes. Pleasant to look upon.\n36-60\nBeautiful. Her mother's daughter. Dark Italian beauty combined with vigorous health creates something lovely and alive. Men notice her.\n61-80\nStunning. Lucia's beauty has passed strongly to this daughter. Combined with her exceptional health, Teresa is radiant—glowing with life and loveliness.\n81-95\nRemarkable Beauty. Nearly her mother's equal. Where Bianca is fragile and ethereal, Teresa is vital and vibrant—beauty that speaks of life and fertility and warmth.\n96-100\nLegendary.

Second child of Queen Lucia d'Este.\n\nSURVIVAL: 99 — Thrives\n\nExceptional health. Rarely sick, quick to recover. The kind of constitution that lives to old age.\n\nTRAITS\n\nTrait\nRoll\nResult\nIntelligence\n12\nAverage\nTemperament\n67\nSpirited\nSpecial Talent\n23\nNeedlework/Art\nPiety\n68\nDevout\nBeauty\n17\nPleasant\n\nTHE PORTRAIT\n\nIntelligence: 12 — Average\n\nTeresa is no scholar. Letters come slowly, Latin is a struggle, and she will never match wits with her brilliant half-siblings. She learns what she must—enough to manage a household, follow a conversation, understand the basics of her station—but books hold no fascination for her. She would rather be doing than reading, moving than studying.\n\nThis is not stupidity. Teresa possesses good common sense, practical wisdom, and an intuitive understanding of people that does not require formal education. She simply lacks the exceptional minds that God gave Catalina and Fernando. In a family of brilliance, she is ordinary.\n\nShe will not mind. Teresa has other gifts.\n\nTemperament: 67 — Spirited\n\nHere is the heart of Teresa: energy, boldness, confidence. She fills a room when she enters—not with the commanding authority of Catalina, but with sheer vitality. She laughs loudly, speaks freely, throws herself into activities with enthusiasm. Where Bianca is a storm of volatile emotions, Teresa is a steady fire—warm, bright, constant.\n\nShe is the child who organizes games, who leads the other children on adventures, who climbs walls and scrapes knees and comes home muddy and grinning. Her robust health supports her spirited nature perfectly. She has energy to spare and uses every drop of it.\n\nShe will be well-liked. Servants will smile when she passes. Other children will seek her company. Her future household will be a happy one, full of activity and warmth.\n\nSpecial Talent: 23 — Needlework/Art\n\nTeresa's hands know things her mind does not. Give her needle and thread, and she creates embroidery that draws admiration from experienced seamstresses. Give her charcoal and paper, and she sketches with surprising skill. She sees patterns, colors, compositions that others miss.\n\nThis talent emerges early. As a small child, she arranges flowers with an instinctive eye for beauty. By adolescence, her needlework will be genuinely exceptional—the kind of work that becomes treasured heirlooms. She may illuminate manuscripts, design tapestries, or simply create beautiful things for the joy of creating.\n\nIn an age when noblewomen are expected to excel at needlework, Teresa will genuinely excel rather than merely perform competently.\n\nPiety: 68 — Devout\n\nLike her sister Bianca, Teresa finds genuine comfort in faith. But where Bianca's devotion is tied to her fragility—a refuge from volatile emotions and physical weakness—Teresa's piety springs from a simpler source: gratitude. She is healthy, happy, loved. God has blessed her abundantly, and she thanks Him for it.\n\nHer prayers are sincere but uncomplicated. She does not wrestle with theological questions or seek mystical experiences. She simply believes, attends Mass with genuine attention, and tries to live as a good Christian should. Her confessor will find her refreshingly straightforward.\n\nShe may be drawn to charitable works—using her artistic talents to create beautiful things for churches, or her spirited energy to organize alms-giving. Faith for Teresa is not a struggle but a joy.\n\nBeauty: 17 — Pleasant\n\nAnd here is the surprise: Lucia's legendary beauty has not passed to this daughter.\n\nTeresa is pleasant-looking. Agreeable features, healthy coloring, bright eyes. She is not ugly—far from it—but standing next to her sister Bianca, she might as well be invisible. Lucia's extraordinary bone structure, the dark Italian eyes that captivate men across crowded halls—these have somehow skipped Teresa entirely.\n\nShe has her mother's coloring but not her magic. Her face is the face of a thousand well-born women: pretty enough, forgettable in a crowd.\n\nThis will shape her life in ways both difficult and liberating. She will never be the diplomatic prize that Bianca represents. Marriage negotiations will not revolve around her face. But she will also never be reduced to her appearance, never treated as a beautiful object to be traded. Men who love her will love her—her spirit, her warmth, her artistic gifts—not a legendary face.\n\nIn a family of exceptional beauty, Teresa is ordinary. And she may be happier for it.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nAttribute\nDescription\nMind\nAverage; practical rather than scholarly\nHeart\nSpirited; energetic, bold, warm, fills rooms with life\nSpirit\nDevout; simple, grateful, sincere faith\nGift\nNeedlework/Art; exceptional skill with needle, brush, and eye for beauty\nBody\nThrives; exceptional health, robust constitution\nFace\nPleasant; agreeable but unremarkable, did not inherit mother's beauty\n\nTeresa is the ordinary one—and that may be her greatest blessing. While Catalina carries the weight of brilliance and spiritual emptiness, while Fernando bears a warrior's body with a scholar's soul, while Bianca is legendary beauty in fragile flesh... Teresa is simply healthy, happy, and good at making beautiful things.\n\nShe will likely be the easiest child to marry well and the most content in her marriage.\n\nPRINCESS JUANA OF CASTILE — TRAIT ROLLS\n\nBorn late 1436 (November/December) in Toledo.

Perhaps the smallpox sweeps through Toledo and leaves her marked. Perhaps a fever takes her to death's door before she claws her way back. Perhaps an accident—a fall, a horse, a childhood mishap—leaves its permanent reminder.\n\nShe survives. But she bears the scars.\n\nThis might manifest as:\n\nPox scarring on her face or body—the most common mark of childhood survival in this era\n\nA weakened limb from a fever that settled in the joints\n\nDamaged hearing or vision from a severe illness\n\nA limp from a childhood accident\n\nWe can determine the specific nature of her mark later, or roll for it now if you wish. Regardless, Juana will carry visible evidence that God tested her and she endured.\n\nThree sisters from Lucia: one fragile but legendary, one robust but plain, one scarred but surviving. The dice paint a complex picture.\n\nNow for her traits:\n\n1. INTELLIGENCE\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-10\nSimple. Sweet-natured but slow. Struggles with letters and numbers.\n11-25\nAverage.

BEAUTY (Modified for Parentage and Scarring)\n\nDaughter of Queen Lucia d'Este (legendary beauty) and King Juan II (above-average). However, Juana's survival roll indicates she will bear visible marks from childhood illness or accident. This will affect her appearance regardless of her underlying features.\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-10\nMarred. The scars dominate. Whatever beauty she might have had is obscured by the marks of her survival. Men look away.\n11-25\nPlain and Marked. Unremarkable features made more so by scarring. She will not be sought for her appearance.\n26-40\nPleasant Despite Scars. Her mother's bone structure shows through, but the marks are visible. Some will see past them; many will not.\n41-60\nAttractive but Scarred. Genuine beauty touched by misfortune. The contrast draws some eyes, repels others. A complicated inheritance.\n61-80\nBeautiful Despite All. Lucia's gifts shine through the damage. The scars become part of her story rather than its defining feature. Men who look past the marks find loveliness beneath.\n81-95\nHauntingly Beautiful. The scars somehow enhance rather than diminish. There is something compelling about beauty that has survived trial—a depth that unmarked prettiness lacks.\n96-100\nTranscendent. Against all odds, Juana's beauty surpasses her scars entirely. Perhaps the marks are positioned where they rarely show, or perhaps her features are so extraordinary that they render the scars irrelevant.

What mark does she bear?\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-10\nSmallpox Scarring (Severe). The pox came for her and left its cruel signature across her face. Pitted skin, perhaps a damaged eye. The marks are impossible to hide and define her appearance at first glance.\n11-20\nSmallpox Scarring (Moderate). The pox touched her but did not ravage. Scattered pitting on cheeks or forehead—visible but not disfiguring. Powder and careful lighting can minimize but not hide.\n21-30\nSmallpox Scarring (Mild). A few marks, perhaps along the hairline or jaw where they can be partially concealed. Evidence of survival, not disfigurement.\n31-40\nFever Damage — Hearing. A terrible fever in infancy damaged her ears. She is partially deaf in one or both ears. She learns to read lips, to position herself in conversations, to hide her limitation. Some mistake her careful attention for intense interest.\n41-50\nFever Damage — Vision. The fever took something from her eyes. Perhaps one eye is clouded or weakened. Perhaps she struggles to see at distance or in dim light. She adapts, but the limitation shapes her life.\n51-60\nFever Damage — Limb. The illness settled in her joints. One leg is weaker than the other, giving her a slight limp. Or perhaps an arm lacks full strength or mobility. She compensates, but physical activities require extra effort.\n61-70\nChildhood Accident — Fall. She fell—from a horse, a wall, a staircase—and broke bones that did not heal quite right. A limp, a stiff joint, a shoulder that aches in cold weather. The mark of youthful recklessness survived.\n71-80\nChildhood Accident — Burn. Fire touched her. A knocked candle, a hearth accident, a kitchen mishap. Scarring on arm, hand, or shoulder—usually hidden by clothing but visible in intimate settings.\n81-90\nAnimal Attack. A dog, a horse, perhaps a hunting accident. Scarring from teeth or hooves, likely on arm or leg. A dramatic story attached to a visible mark.\n91-95\nNear-Drowning. She almost drowned as a child and was pulled back from death. No visible scarring, but a lasting fear of water and occasional breathing difficulties. The lungs remember what the mind tries to forget.\n96-100\nMysterious Illness. Something struck her that physicians could not name. She recovered, but something is... different. Perhaps occasional tremors in her hands. Perhaps moments of absence where she seems elsewhere. Perhaps simply a fragility that emerges under stress.

Third child of Queen Lucia d'Este.\n\nSURVIVAL: 32 — Survives with Difficulty\n\nTHE MARK: 98 — Mysterious Illness\n\nSomething happened to Juana when she was four or five years old.\n\nThe physicians could not name it. One moment she was playing in the nursery; the next she collapsed, burning with fever, eyes rolled back, limbs rigid. For three days she lay between life and death, sometimes screaming at things no one else could see, sometimes utterly still. The priests were summoned. Last rites were prepared.\n\nThen, as suddenly as it came, the crisis passed. Juana opened her eyes, asked for water, and seemed... herself. Mostly.\n\nBut something is different now. Sometimes her hands tremble for no reason—a quiver that comes and goes. Sometimes she pauses mid-sentence, her eyes distant, as if listening to something far away. Sometimes she knows things she should not know—who is at the door before they knock, what letter a messenger carries before it is opened.\n\nThe physicians call it \"residual fever damage\" and prescribe rest. The priests whisper of other possibilities. Juana herself speaks little of these moments, but her fervent piety suggests she has drawn her own conclusions about what touched her during those three days of darkness.\n\nIs it holy?

She learns languages easily, understands complex political situations when they are explained, and remembers details that others forget.\n\nMore than book-learning, Juana has insight. She sees through flattery, detects lies, understands motivations. Whether this is natural sharpness or something connected to her mysterious illness, none can say. But those who try to deceive her often find themselves exposed by a single quiet question from the princess with the knowing eyes.\n\nTemperament: 99 — Magnetic\n\nHere is Juana's greatest gift, and it is extraordinary.\n\nThere is something about her that draws people inexorably. Not Catalina's commanding authority that demands obedience. Not Teresa's warm spiritedness that makes people smile. Something deeper, stranger, more powerful. When Juana enters a room, eyes turn to her without knowing why. When she speaks, people lean closer. When she asks for something, refusal feels almost physically difficult.\n\nMen will want to die for her. Women will want to be her. Servants will weep with joy at her praise. Enemies will find their hatred softening into confused fascination. She does not demand loyalty—she inspires it, effortlessly, inevitably, almost supernaturally.\n\nCombined with her mysterious episodes and fervent faith, this magnetic quality will make her a figure of intense speculation. Saint or sorceress? Prophet or madwoman? Those who love her will love her absolutely. Those who fear her will fear her deeply.\n\nShe is perhaps the most dangerous of Juan's children.\n\nSpecial Talent: 78 — Horsemanship\n\nLike her half-sister Catalina, Juana is born to the saddle. She rides as if horse and rider share one mind, one body. Where other children learn to stay mounted, Juana learns to fly. She will outride grown knights by adolescence, taking jumps that make stable masters clutch their hearts, galloping across terrain that would unseat experienced cavalry.\n\nOn horseback, the occasional tremors in her hands disappear entirely. On horseback, the distant moments never come. It is as if riding grounds her, connects her to the physical world in a way that nothing else does. She will spend as much time in the saddle as propriety allows—and sometimes more.\n\nPiety: 91 — Fervent\n\nJuana's faith burns like a flame.\n\nAfter her mysterious illness—after whatever happened during those three days of fever and visions—Juana emerged with an intensity of belief that startles even the most devout clergy. She prays for hours. She fasts beyond what is required. She speaks of God with a certainty that borders on the uncomfortable.\n\nShe believes she was touched by something divine during her crisis. Spared for a purpose. Called to serve. The trembling hands, the distant moments, the things she sometimes knows before she should—these are not illness to Juana. They are gifts. Difficult gifts, frightening gifts, but gifts nonetheless.\n\nHer confessor will need to be chosen with extreme care. The wrong guidance could channel this fervor into dangerous directions. The right guidance could shape a genuine mystic, a saint in the making.\n\nOr perhaps the physicians are right, and it is simply fever damage expressing itself through religious obsession. The Church has seen both.\n\nBeauty: 64 — Beautiful Despite All\n\nLucia's gifts have passed to this daughter—not the legendary, heartbreaking beauty of Bianca, but genuine loveliness nonetheless. Dark Italian eyes, good bone structure, a face that draws second glances. She is beautiful in the way of a woman meant to be noticed.\n\nAnd she bears no visible scars. Whatever touched her during her illness left no external mark. Her beauty is unmarred, whole, untouched.\n\nThis makes her more unsettling, not less. A scarred survivor tells a clear story. Juana's story is written somewhere invisible, in trembling hands and distant eyes and knowledge that comes from nowhere. Her beautiful face reveals nothing of what lies beneath.\n\nMen will find her captivating—and slightly unnerving. Her magnetic presence will draw them close; her mysterious depths will make them hesitate. Some will worship her. Some will flee her. Few will be indifferent.\n\nTHE MYSTERY\n\nJuana is the child who should not exist.\n\nBy all rights, the illness should have killed her, or at minimum left obvious damage. Instead, she survived whole and beautiful—but changed. She emerged from death's door with a magnetic presence that borders on the supernatural, a fervent faith that speaks of direct divine encounter, and strange episodes that physicians cannot explain.\n\nIs she touched by God? By something else? By nothing at all except fever-damaged nerves?\n\nJuan will wrestle with this question. The Church will wrestle with this question. Juana herself seems certain of the answer—but certainty is not always sanity, and saints are often indistinguishable from madwomen until history renders its verdict.\n\nShe will be difficult to marry. What prince wants a wife who trembles, who sees things, who burns with religious fervor? But her magnetic quality may overcome such concerns—and a strategic match to a dynasty that values holiness over health could turn her peculiarities into assets.\n\nOr she may refuse marriage entirely. The religious life calls to women like Juana. A convent—or better, leadership of a convent—might be her truest path.\n\nShe is one year old now, babbling in her cradle, the mysterious illness still years away. But the shape of her future is already written in the stars.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nAttribute\nDescription\nMind\nSharp; perceptive, reads people, sees through deception\nHeart\nMagnetic; extraordinary charisma that draws absolute devotion\nSpirit\nFervent; burning faith, believes herself touched by divine purpose\nGift\nHorsemanship; rides as if born to the saddle, finds peace on horseback\nBody\nSurvived with difficulty; no visible scars but mysterious internal effects\nFace\nBeautiful; mother's gifts passed clearly, unmarred and lovely\nMark\nMysterious illness; occasional tremors, distant moments, uncanny knowledge\n\nCatalina: brilliant, commanding, spiritually empty, legendary voice.\nFernando: brilliant, bold, martially hopeless, magnificent presence.\nBianca: volatile, legendary beauty, fragile as glass.\nTeresa: average, spirited, plain but healthy, gifted with needle and brush.\nJuana: sharp, magnetic, fervent, beautiful, touched by something unknown.\n\nNow for the newborn son, Your Majesty.

      "text": "The scene is set: Juan has just arrived in Toledo on January 7, 1438 (Epiphany), returning from Naples. Lucia gave birth to their fourth child together (Juan's sixth overall) in late 1437 - a son, finally, after three daughters from Lucia.\n\nI should narrate Lucia's response. She's recovering from childbirth (the roll was 44 - normal delivery), the baby is a few weeks old. Lucia is a strong-willed, intelligent woman who sees herself as Juan's partner. She might have waited for Juan to return to name the son together, or she might have a suggestion ready.\n\nGiven that this is a son - a spare heir, very important dynastically - the naming is significant. Lucia would likely want Juan's input, especially for a male heir. But she might have thoughts.\n\nLet me write Lucia's response, keeping it short since this is dialogue - I should stop after she speaks to let the player respond.\n\nThe great hall of the Alcázar is warm with firelight and the press of bodies—courtiers, servants, guards, all gathered to witness the King's return. But Juan's eyes find only his wife.\n\nLucia sits in a high-backed chair near the hearth, still pale from childbirth but with color returning to her cheeks. In her arms, wrapped in white linen embroidered with the arms of Castile and Este, lies a small bundle. Dark hair, like his mother. A tiny fist waving in the air.\n\nThe older children cluster around—Fernando tugging at Juan's cloak, Catalina standing with that preternatural composure of hers, Bianca watching from a nurse's arms, Teresa toddling toward her father with arms outstretched. And somewhere in the background, little Juana sleeps in her cradle, oblivious to the reunion.\n\nLucia looks up as Juan approaches. That familiar half-smile crosses her face—the one that says she has been waiting, that she has opinions, that she is glad to see him despite everything.\n\n\"Finalmente,\" she says softly. \"Three crowns, and still you find your way home.\"\n\nShe shifts the bundle so Juan can see the boy's face—eyes closed, rosebud mouth, the unmistakable features of a newborn who could become anything.\n\n\"I have waited for you,\" Lucia answers his question. \"A son deserves his father's voice in the naming. Though...\" She pauses, grey-green eyes meeting his. \"I have thoughts, if you wish to hear them. He is your second son, your spare heir, born in a year when you gained two kingdoms. That seems to me a name that should mean something.\"\n\nShe waits.",

A Greek connection, like his own name Juan/Ioannes\n\nLet me think about this:\n\nSaint Nicholas (Nikolaos in Greek) - the famous bishop of Myra, associated with generosity and miracles. In Castilian, this would be \"Nicolás.\"\n\nThe Greek form is Nikolaos (Νικόλαος), meaning \"victory of the people\" - from Nike (victory) and Laos (people).\n\nThis is actually a meaningful choice given Juan's connection to Constantinople and the Greek world. The name has both Western and Eastern resonance.\n\nLucia would respond in character - she's intelligent, has opinions, and is Italian. She might appreciate the Byzantine connection given Juan's imperial ambitions.\n\nLet me have Lucia respond thoughtfully to this suggestion.\n\nLucia's eyes brighten with interest. She shifts the baby slightly, studying his small face as if trying the name on him.\n\n\"Nicolás,\" she says, letting the Castilian form roll off her tongue. \"A strong name. The saint was a bishop of Myra—Greek lands, now under the Turk. A protector of children, of sailors, of the wrongly accused.\" A slight smile. \"Appropriate for a prince who may one day govern Greek waters.\"\n\nShe traces a finger along the baby's cheek. He stirs but does not wake.\n\n\"In Greek it would be Nikolaos—Νικόλαος. 'Victory of the people.' A name that speaks of triumph.\" She glances up at Juan. \"And yes, there is poetry in it. Juan and Ioannes. Nicolás and Nikolaos. Father and son, bound to both West and East.\"\n\nShe pauses, considering. \"The Italian form is Niccolò—like my uncle the Marquess. That carries weight in Ferrara and the Italian courts, should he ever need it.\"\n\nThe baby yawns, tiny and perfect.\n\n\"Nicolás,\" Lucia repeats, more softly now. \"Nicolás de Trastámara. Second son of the King of Three Crowns.\" She looks up at Juan with that direct gaze of hers. \"It suits him, I think. Unless you wish to honor a grandfather or saint of Castile instead? Fernando carries your father's legacy. This one could carry... something new. Something that looks east, toward Constantinople.\"\n\nShe waits for his decision, the firelight playing across her features.",

When fevers sweep through the nursery, he will shake them off in days while others languish for weeks. When childhood ailments come calling—and they will—his body will fight them off with the resilience of good blood and good fortune. He will grow strong, healthy, robust.\n\nA spare heir who will actually live to serve as one, should God forbid the need arise.\n\nTwo sons now: Fernando the magnificent scholar who cannot fight, and Nicolás whose fate is yet unwritten. The succession is more secure than it has ever been.\n\nNow for his traits. As a prince—a second son who may need to serve as military commander, governor, or diplomatic asset—we use the tables appropriate for royal sons:\n\n1. INTELLIGENCE\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-10\nSimple. Good-natured but slow. Will need guidance all his life.\n11-25\nAverage. Learns what he must. A conventional prince, neither brilliant nor foolish.\n26-50\nCapable. Quick enough for statecraft, understands complex situations.\n51-75\nSharp. Keen mind for politics, strategy, and intrigue. Learns quickly.\n76-90\nBrilliant. Exceptional intellect. Could match scholars, outmaneuver diplomats.\n91-100\nExtraordinary. A mind that comes once in generations.\n\n2. TEMPERAMENT\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-15\nVolatile. Passionate but unpredictable. Great heights and terrible rages.\n16-30\nStubborn. Immovable once decided. Persistence or obstinacy, depending on the cause.\n31-50\nSteady. Reliable, even-keeled. Perhaps uninspiring, but men know where they stand.\n51-70\nBold. Confident, decisive, willing to act. Fills a room when he enters.\n71-85\nCommanding. Natural authority. Men follow him without knowing why.\n86-100\nCharismatic. That rare quality that inspires devotion. Men would die for him gladly.\n\n3. MARTIAL APTITUDE\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-15\nReluctant. Prefers books or prayer to the training yard. Adequate at best.\n16-30\nCompetent. Does his duty. Will not disgrace himself but will never excel.\n31-50\nCapable. Good with sword and lance. A solid knight among knights.\n51-70\nSkilled. Excels in the lists. Men respect his prowess.\n71-85\nFormidable. Tournament champion material. Dangerous in single combat.\n86-95\nExceptional. One of the finest warriors of his generation.\n96-100\nLegendary. The kind of warrior kings remember for centuries—El Cid reborn.\n\n4. SPECIAL TALENT\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-20\nNone particular. Competent at many things, exceptional at nothing.\n21-35\nHorsemanship. Born to the saddle. Commands cavalry like an extension of himself.\n36-50\nDiplomacy. Reads people, navigates courts, builds alliances.\n51-65\nStrategy. Sees the board, thinks three moves ahead. A general's mind.\n66-75\nAdministration. Understands treasury, logistics, governance. Makes kingdoms function.\n76-85\nLanguages. Picks up tongues effortlessly. Speaks to men in their own words.\n86-95\nOratory. Words come easily. Can move crowds, inspire armies, sway councils.\n96-100\nMultiple gifts. Roll twice more; he has both.\n\n5. PIETY\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-15\nIndifferent. Goes through motions. Faith is politics, nothing more.\n16-35\nConventional. Believes as expected. Neither fervent nor doubting.\n36-60\nSincere. Genuine faith that guides but does not dominate.\n61-80\nDevout. Deep spiritual life. Prayer matters to him. Seeks God's will.\n81-95\nFervent. Faith burns bright. Crusading spirit. May see himself as God's instrument.\n96-100\nMystic. Visions, certainty, direct connection to the divine—or believes so.\n\n6. PHYSICAL PRESENCE\n\nSon of Juan II (above-average) and Lucia d'Este (legendary beauty). The same modified table we would use for Fernando.\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-10\nUnimpressive. Small, slight, or otherwise physically unremarkable.\n11-25\nOrdinary. Neither commanding nor forgettable. Pleasant enough.\n26-45\nWell-made. Good health, decent stature. Looks the part of nobility.\n46-65\nHandsome. His mother's gifts show. Women notice him; men respect his bearing.\n66-80\nStriking. Tall, strong, or otherwise physically impressive. Commands attention.\n81-95\nMagnificent. The kind of presence that makes men think \"there stands a prince.\"\n96-100\nLegendary.

This creates fascinating dynastic tension. Fernando will be king, but Nicolás will be the warrior. This could be a perfect partnership... or a source of deep tension.\n\nLet me write this up properly.\n\nPRINCE NICOLÁS DE TRASTÁMARA — COMPLETE PORTRAIT\n\nBorn late 1437 in Toledo. Fourth child of Queen Lucia d'Este. Second son of King Juan II. Named for Saint Nicholas of Myra.\n\nSURVIVAL: 78 — Survives Well\n\nHardy constitution. Robust health into adulthood.\n\nTRAITS\n\nTrait\nRoll\nResult\nIntelligence\n72\nSharp\nTemperament\n74\nCommanding\nMartial Aptitude\n99\nLegendary\nSpecial Talent\n2\nNone particular\nPiety\n73\nDevout\nPhysical Presence\n88\nMagnificent\n\nTHE PORTRAIT\n\nIntelligence: 72 — Sharp\n\nNicolás possesses a keen, practical mind. He will never match his half-brother Fernando's scholarly brilliance or his half-sister Catalina's extraordinary intellect, but he grasps situations quickly, learns from experience, and understands men. His intelligence is the intelligence of the field commander—rapid assessment, clear decision, efficient action.\n\nHe will not write treatises or debate theologians. But he will read a battlefield in a glance, understand an enemy's intentions from the disposition of their forces, and know when to press an advantage and when to withdraw. His mind serves his body, not the other way around.\n\nTemperament: 74 — Commanding\n\nThere is something in Nicolás that makes men obey.\n\nNot the magnetic, almost supernatural draw of his sister Juana. Not the assumed authority of Catalina. Something rougher, more martial—the natural command of a man born to lead soldiers. When Nicolás speaks, men listen. When he gives orders, men follow. It is not charisma; it is presence. The unmistakable quality of a leader.\n\nEven as a child, this will manifest. Other boys will fall into line behind him without being asked. Servants will jump to his commands. Training masters will note that the young prince organizes the other squires instinctively, placing them where they should be, correcting their stances, directing their efforts.\n\nHe is born to command armies.\n\nMartial Aptitude: 99 — Legendary\n\nHere is the gift that defines him.\n\nNicolás takes to arms as naturally as breathing. The sword feels like an extension of his hand. The lance finds its target without conscious thought. On horseback, in the lists, on foot with blade and shield—it does not matter. He excels. He dominates.\n\nBy twelve, he will unhorse squires twice his age. By sixteen, he will be the finest blade in Castile. By twenty, songs will be sung of his prowess. He is El Cid reborn, the warrior prince that legends are made of, the kind of fighter who appears once in a generation and reshapes the battlefield by his mere presence.\n\nThis is not merely skill, though skill he has in abundance. It is instinct. He knows where the enemy's blade will fall before it moves. He feels the rhythm of combat like music. Violence is his native language, and he speaks it with terrible fluency.\n\nIn an age of gunpowder and changing warfare, Nicolás is a throwback—a champion of single combat, a leader who fights at the front of his men, a prince whose personal valor will inspire armies to impossible feats.\n\nThe cruelest irony of the House of Trastámara: the heir Fernando has a warrior's body and a scholar's soul. The spare Nicolás has both body and soul of a warrior born.\n\nSpecial Talent: 2 — None Particular\n\nBeyond his martial gifts, Nicolás is... ordinary.\n\nHe has no ear for languages—he will struggle with Latin and never master Greek. He has no head for administration—ledgers bore him and logistics confuse him. He has no talent for diplomacy—he says what he means and means what he says, which is admirable but not subtle. He cannot sing, cannot paint, cannot compose verse.\n\nHe is a sword. A magnificent sword, the finest sword in Christendom perhaps—but only a sword.\n\nThis limitation will shape his life. He will need others to handle the tasks he cannot: brothers to negotiate treaties, sisters to charm foreign courts, advisors to manage his accounts. Alone, he can conquer. He cannot govern.\n\nBut then, he is a second son. Governing is Fernando's burden, not his.\n\nPiety: 73 — Devout\n\nNicolás believes.\n\nNot with Juana's fervent intensity or Catalina's performed emptiness, but with the solid, martial faith of a crusading knight. God is real to him. Christ died for men's sins. The Church guides souls to salvation. These truths are as certain to him as the weight of a sword in his hand.\n\nHe will pray before battle—genuinely, not for show. He will attend Mass with attention, take communion with reverence, confess his sins with honesty. His faith is the faith of the miles Christi, the soldier of Christ: uncomplicated, unshakeable, expressed through deeds rather than words.\n\nWhen he kills enemies of the Faith—Moors, Turks, heretics—he will do so with clean conscience, believing himself an instrument of divine will. This is both his strength and his danger. A devout warrior is formidable. A devout warrior who believes God endorses his violence is terrifying.\n\nPhysical Presence: 88 — Magnificent\n\nThe second son looks the part even more than the first.\n\nNicolás grows tall, broad-shouldered, thick with muscle. His mother's dark Italian coloring combines with his father's strong features to create something striking—a face that belongs on coins, a body that belongs in armor. When he enters a room in full harness, men's breath catches. When he rides at the head of a column, he looks like a king.\n\nMore than Fernando, who has the build of a warrior but the bearing of a scholar, Nicolás moves like a fighter. There is economy in his gestures, coiled readiness in his stance, the unconscious grace of a predator. Women will swoon. Men will envy. Enemies will fear.\n\nHe is what a prince should look like, what a champion should look like, what a king should look like.\n\nBut he is the second son.\n\nTHE IRONY\n\nGod has a sense of humor, it seems.\n\nFernando, Prince of Asturias, heir to three crowns, has a magnificent body housing a scholar's soul. He looks like a warrior-king and cannot fight. His hands, made for gripping a war-sword, prefer to turn pages.\n\nNicolás, second son, spare heir, has been given everything Fernando lacks. The legendary martial prowess. The commanding presence. The warrior's instinct. He is everything a medieval king should be—except he will never be king.\n\nThis could be a blessing. Fernando rules, Nicolás fights. The brilliant diplomat-king and his legendary warrior-brother, each doing what God made them to do. A partnership that could reshape Europe.\n\nOr it could be a curse. What happens when the second son is so obviously superior to the first in all the ways that medieval men value? When soldiers would rather follow Nicolás than Fernando? When nobles whisper that the wrong brother wears the crown?\n\nHistory is littered with second sons who should have been first. Some served faithfully. Some rebelled.

Now I should return to the narrative moment - Juan has just named his son Nicolás, and we've documented all the children. I should summarize what we've created and perhaps briefly return to the scene.\n\nThe document has been created with comprehensive profiles of all six children.\n\nLucia watches as you speak your son's name over the infant. The firelight plays across the baby's face—Nicolás, your second son, named for a Greek saint from lands now under Ottoman rule.\n\n\"Nicolás,\" she repeats softly, testing the weight of it. \"A good name. A name that looks east.\" She glances at Fernando, who is trying to peer at the baby while simultaneously tugging at your cloak for attention. \"Two sons now. The dynasty is secure.\"\n\nShe does not say what both of you are thinking: that this newborn—weeks old, still learning to breathe—carries the weight of being spare heir to three kingdoms. That his brother Fernando, the magnificent boy who cannot hold a sword properly, will need someone to fight his battles. That perhaps God, in His wisdom, has given you the warrior your dynasty needs in the body of a second son.\n\nBut such thoughts are for another day. Tonight, you are home. Your wife is recovering. Your children are healthy—all six of them, each a world unto themselves. Catalina with her brilliant emptiness. Fernando with his scholar's soul in a warrior's frame. Bianca, legendary beauty in fragile flesh. Teresa, blessedly ordinary. Juana, touched by something unknown. And now Nicolás, whose stars promise legendary prowess with the sword.\n\nThe House of Trastámara will not want for drama in the generations to come.\n\nLittle Catalina pushes forward, imperious as always. \"I want to see,\" she announces. \"Is he small like Juana was?\"\n\nFile: /mnt/user-data/outputs/Royal_Children_Database_1438.docx",
