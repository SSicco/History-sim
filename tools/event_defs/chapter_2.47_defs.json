The compound is described as a walled community at the edge of Toledo where Juan lives with his extended family: wife Lucia, children Catalina (nearly 6), Fernando (4.5), Bianca (3.5), Teresa (2-3), Juana (14-18 months), and Nicolas (infant), plus his sister Maria of Aragon, and the children's companions Pedro (tanner's son) and Lucia (weaver's daughter). Juan gathers the children and tells them about the upcoming summer muster, describing it as soldiers gathering in the kingdom and the royal family marching alongside them.",

Fernando's exceptional natural talent surprises everyone, while Pedro's hidden gift astonishes the stable master.

He engages her in a conversation echoing their earlier discussion under the stars about her emotional emptiness. Catalina articulates her sense that some people see beauty in things she can only understand intellectually. Juan reassures her that she has already done remarkable things that most adults could not do, referencing her diplomatic insight and the rescue at Fraga. The conversation ends on a hopeful note as Catalina acknowledges that 'useful' can be its own kind of purpose, and the children ride together joyfully across the spring fields.",

Juan reassures her with promises of a dowry for Lucia and proposes that Marta teach weaving to the royal children, establishing a reciprocal relationship.

A second d100 roll to determine the cause: Roll 49 (Ottoman Anxiety) indicates that coastal communities across the Mediterranean stayed home due to fear of Ottoman raids, fueled by rumors of Ottoman naval movements. Juan responds decisively: he sends general messages to coastal populations assuring them the fleet will investigate any threats, orders the fleet to increase patrols, and dispatches Isaac de Baeza to investigate the source of the panic rumors. Despite the overall disappointment, the Toledo muster assembles approximately 1,214 men of the expected larger force.",

Lieutenant de Mendoza reports 82 light cavalry (jinetes) and 12 dedicated scouts. Juan and his children (Fernando, Catalina, Pedro, Lucia) travel with the vanguard.

The bridge assault produces a key moment when Toledo Sergeant Flores and Avila Corporal Vasquez spontaneously cooperate to hold the line.

She reveals a sophisticated understanding of the muster's purpose: making people need each other more than they dislike each other, and recognizing that the children's presence was deliberately symbolic (soldiers would tell families about marching with the prince and princess). She asks if this is why kings have always brought their sons to war, 'not just to learn, but to be seen.' Upon arriving home at Casa de las Palomas, the family reunites. Lucia mentions a sealed dispatch from Isaac de Baeza that arrived during their absence. Fernando and Catalina recount the muster to the household. Fernando excitedly describes the bridge assault, while Catalina delivers measured strategic observations. Catalina publicly credits Fernando's tactical eye in noticing the gap in enemy lines.",

The revised table offers categories including Portuguese Integration, Ottoman Catastrophe, Council of Basel's Gift, Silver Discovery, Great Defection, Byzantine Bequest, Extinction of Rivals, Navarrese Submission, African Windfall, French Collapse, or Multiple Blessings.

He summons Diego de Daza for the 1438 financial report and reveals the silver discovery. Diego initially overestimates the revenue (confusing gross yield with Crown revenue), but Juan corrects him: with the royal fifth tax (quinto real) on private operations, the Crown would only receive 60,000-80,000 florins annually, not the full 300,000-400,000. Diego explains the three options: full private operation (quinto only, 60-80k), full Crown operation (200-270k net after costs), or Crown-funded contract operation (180-250k net). Juan proposes an innovative hybrid model: the Crown provides security, infrastructure (roads), and operates the refineries, while miners organize themselves into groups and mine independently, receiving 30% of the refined silver yield with the Crown keeping 70%.",

      "summary": "The mining plan is refined: Juan scraps the loan system in favor of equipment rental to avoid debt complications. Security relies on practical measures rather than elaborate sealing systems, since ore is bulky and refining is difficult to hide illegally. Mining groups must register with leaders and divide profits equally among members. Discussion turns to minting new coins from the silver. Diego presents three options: keep as bullion (international value but not circulating), mint coins (stimulates economy but risks inflation), or a balanced approach (mint some, reserve some). Diego suggests a new standardized silver coin accepted across all five territories could serve as a unifying imperial currency, comparing it to the Roman denarius. Juan then seeks foreign refining expertise. A d100 roll: Roll 83 (Excellent) attracts Heinrich von Steinberg, a legendary 53-year-old Saxon master refiner from Freiberg with 31 years' experience, who brings 12 journeymen including two who have mastered the cutting-edge pattinson process.",
