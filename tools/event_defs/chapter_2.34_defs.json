Sultan's Approach Roll 43 = Wary and Testing: he comes to take Juan's measure, guards intentions closely, reveals nothing. The Sultan sends a message inviting Juan aboard his flagship. Juan refuses, instead donning armor and setting up a table on the quay with food and wine, shouting a greeting in Arabic and proposing neutral ground. Sultan's Response Roll 16 = Cold Reception: the Grand Vizier Candarli Halil Pasha is sent instead of the Sultan, dismissing Juan's 'quayside theater.' Juan diplomatically argues that the Sultan's invitation treats him as a subject, not a fellow monarch. After tense exchanges, Halil Pasha is impressed by Juan's reasoning and takes a counter-proposal back to Murad: meet in an Ottoman field tent on neutral ground between the ships, 50 men each, 3 attendants inside. The Sultan accepts. The pavilion is erected the next morning.",

      "summary": "Juan meets Sultan Murad II in the Ottoman pavilion on Tenedos. Murad speaks directly in Arabic, dropping the translator. He challenges Juan to explain what he actually wants. Juan demands all Byzantine lands returned: all European Ottoman territories, Greek islands, and Asian coastal areas. Sultan's Reaction Roll 79 = Grudging Respect for Boldness: Murad recognizes this as a negotiating tactic and engages seriously, noting that his ancestors took lands Christians could not defend. He asks what Juan truly wants. Juan states he wants to avoid bloodshed but will fight if necessary, proposing rules of civilized warfare including honoring white flags, safe conduct, and care for wounded. Murad observes that Juan is 'not what I expected' and asks when the attack will come. Juan replies he does not know, only that when Murad breaches the gates, Juan will be standing behind them. Juan walks out of the tent and orders immediate departure. Murad formally rejects the peace demand, establishing that only the way of arms remains.",

They pass Gallipoli in the deep of night with lanterns darkened; the Ottoman galleys sit silent at anchor with no alarm raised. The fleet emerges into the Sea of Marmara at dawn and arrives at Constantinople on March 23rd. Bells ring as the Catalina enters harbor; crowds gather at the quays.

Sea walls and Golden Horn walls largely untouched. Towers repaired but siege engines ancient. Cannon Production Roll 47 = Limited: four cannon produced total.

Nearly all bronze exhausted with about 2,000 pounds remaining. Juan promises to send experienced cannon founders and more ore.",

Several candidates are discussed including Alexios Philanthropenos, Loukas Maurikas, and Portuguese Admiral Ataíde. Juan appoints Georgios Sphrantzes as Megas Doux over Emperor John's objection that he cannot spare his Protovestiarios. Sphrantzes inspects the Neorion shipyard over three days and delivers his assessment: three slipways structurally sound, 62 shipwrights available (32 elderly Byzantine, 11 working-age Byzantine, 19 Latin settlers). Phase One plan (1435-1436): restore shipyard for 30,000 florins. Phase Two (1437-1440): build 2-6 vessels per year, targeting 12-15 imperial ships by 1440. Juan approves full funding immediately.

Halil Pasha argues that the Karamanid threat to the east must be crushed before a western campaign, that Christian coalitions historically fracture on their own, and that a truce serves Ottoman interests while appearing to serve Christian ones. Murad has not decided on peace but is considering it. Within weeks, a formal truce proposal is drafted: a ten-year ceasefire with free merchant passage through the straits, trade in Ottoman ports at equal rates with Venice and Genoa, prisoner exchanges, permanent ambassadors, and no new fortifications beyond existing walls.

He details the Palaiologos succession: John VIII is childless and unlikely to change; Theodore II has only one daughter Helena and may be dying; Constantine is capable and the greatest obstacle; Demetrios and Thomas are young enough to father sons. Juan ultimately clarifies he does not want the crown itself but wants to merge the realms and rule all territories as one empire while keeping the Emperor as a ceremonial figurehead. Isaac proposes a framework: expand the Joint Treasury to cover all civil revenues, appoint a Sakellarios to administer the combined treasury, provide the Emperor a generous stipend, and include a succession clause positioning the Defensor to assume imperial responsibilities if the Palaiologos line fails. Juan decides on 22,000 florins annually for the Emperor's stipend (equal to his own Castilian household costs) and the title of Sakellarios for the administrator.",
