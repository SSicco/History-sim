Roll 39 (Ottoman Diplomatic Pressure): An Ottoman embassy of fifteen men led by Hamza Bey arrives in Constantinople, ostensibly carrying greetings from Sultan Murad II but clearly sent to assess Juan's presence and activities. The Emperor must decide how to handle the embassy while Juan prepares for his own meeting with Hamza Bey. The stage is set for a tense day of diplomatic maneuvering as Juan must manage both the Ottoman threat and his ongoing negotiations with the Emperor over the Chrysobull decree.",

Juan argues for signing, noting the evidence of Notaras's treason and the assassination attempt on Sphrantzes. A d100 table is drafted for the Emperor's decision on the decree. Roll 47 (Reluctant Signature -- Duty Over Pride): The Emperor signs the Chrysobull in a formal ceremony on May 11th, naming Juan as Defensor Romaniae, but his heart is not fully in it. He signs 'because we are out of choices,' trembling as he writes but mastering his hand. The decree grants Juan authority to command military forces, administer justice in defense matters, treat with foreign powers, and organize expeditions, while pledging to respect imperial sovereignty, defend Orthodox practice, and submit civil governance to imperial authority. Juan examines the document and confirms the signature, seal, and text are valid and binding.",

      "summary": "Juan receives Ottoman envoy Hamza Bey at the Latin Compound for a private diplomatic audience. Juan stuns the veteran diplomat by greeting him in Arabic ('Salaam aleikum'), forcing a complete reassessment. A sophisticated fencing match follows: Hamza Bey probes Juan's intentions in Constantinople, noting the knights, gold, and wall repairs. Juan deflects by asking about the Sultan and pointedly references the fall of Thessalonica four years prior. Juan then strategically concedes that Constantinople will inevitably fall, which Hamza Bey recognizes as a rhetorical gambit. The GM corrects the exchange to reflect proper Ottoman diplomatic protocol -- Hamza Bey would not interrogate a foreign king but would observe, note, and report. The meeting concludes with diplomatic courtesies: Hamza Bey delivers the Sultan's message (we are watching, we expect you to leave), and Juan extends warm regards to the Sultan, expressing hope for a future personal meeting.",

Juan also tasks Kantakouzenos with a counterintelligence sweep: sealing city gates, watching the harbor, arresting known Ottoman agents. The Emperor draws a line: 'Justice, not terror.

Juan explains that he does not hear God's voice or receive visions, but sees 'glimpses of heaven' -- the world as it should be -- and strives to make it real. He shares his full story: his love for his first wife Isabel, the profound moment of Catalina's birth, Isabel's death in childbirth, his rage at God before his entire court, how grief made him more determined to shield others from loss. He speaks passionately against the devshirme (blood tax) and child soldiers. The Emperor is deeply moved, recognizing Juan is neither zealot nor schemer but a man who acts from genuine principle. He confesses he had forgotten what it was like to believe in anyone, and says 'perhaps even friends.' The conversation draws parallels to Byzantine hesychast mysticism and Aristotelian eudaimonia.",

The fall of Thessalonica in 1430 is analyzed as a cautionary tale -- a city that had been sold to Venice was besieged and its population enslaved, demonstrating that accommodation guarantees nothing.

      "summary": "Juan orders Captain Fernan to transfer 60,000 florins from the Castilian military treasury to the combined Apokatastasis fund, immediately resolving the Byzantine fiscal crisis. He then asks why Italian communities collect so much more revenue than the Empire. Sphrantzes explains the historical accumulation of treaty privileges: the Treaty of Nymphaeum (1261) gave Genoa autonomous customs at Galata, Venetian privileges date to 1082, and each successive crisis saw more concessions traded for naval support. These revenues cannot be seized without risking war with the maritime powers. However, Sphrantzes identifies Juan's existing reforms as the long-term solution: the Chrysobull of the Choice, mercantile courts, and reformed tariffs can attract trade to Byzantine harbors through better terms, gradually shifting the balance through economic competition rather than force. The chapter concludes with the foundation of the Byzantine-Castilian partnership formally established through documented treaties, a well-funded joint treasury, and a roadmap for economic recovery.",
