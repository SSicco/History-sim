      "summary": "The Restoration Council convenes at the Blachernae Palace to discuss title distribution for future reconquests. Roll 4 (Hostile Rejection): The eldest Raoul brother invokes Fourth Crusade trauma, challenging Juan's trustworthiness as a Latin king. Roll 50 (Impasse): Juan's sincere appeal is met with silence; the room neither rejects nor embraces him. The Asanes patriarch breaks the deadlock by acknowledging his family's claim to Mesembria. Three categories of titles are established: ancient claims confirmed (Mesembria to Asanes, Adrianople to Kantakouzenoi, Nicaea acknowledged to Laskaris), disputed claims requiring adjudication (Serres between House Raoul and House Melissenos), and unclaimed titles distributed by military contribution (1 noble = 20 soldiers ratio). A five-member tribunal is formed for the Serres dispute: the Asanes patriarch, a Bryennios observer, Niketas Doukas, Kourtikios, and the young Laskaris. Roll 48 (Conditional Commitment): The eldest Raoul conditionally commits seventy men, pending the Serres adjudication. The Bryennios observer unexpectedly pledges thirty men. Approximately 300 men are pledged by session's end. Juan's allies Philanthropenos and Kantakouzenos belatedly defend Juan's established record of good faith, leading to a more realistic acknowledgment of his contributions.",

Roll 67 (Professional Italian Race): Venetian and Genoese riders compete cleanly but coldly. Roll 10 (Disaster in Mixed Race): Venetian Contarini deliberately strikes Genoese Fregoso, causing Greek rider Demetrios to crash. Juan immediately suspends the race and appoints Theodoros as judge. Contarini is disqualified under ancient Hippodrome codes and the race is restarted. Roll 42 (Competent Recovery): Castilian knight Ibañez wins the restarted race. Juan publicly gifts Trueno to Stavros, creating a powerful symbol of Greek-Castilian cooperation. Roll 61 (Gift Ceremony): Stavros is overwhelmed; the crowd erupts. A melee between a Greek veteran and Castilian knight de Vergara ends in a draw, cementing mutual respect. Roll 27 (Joust Embarrassment): Greek nobles perform poorly in jousting but the crowd takes it in good humor. Theodoros closes the day summarizing all results.",

He reveals that Loukas Notaras effectively controls him through intimidation, describing how his advisor Alexios was murdered ('fell from a balcony') after supporting a Venetian alliance. The Emperor confesses he is afraid to give orders in his own palace. Juan speaks of his vision of the Kingdom of Heaven on earth and offers to name Alfonso of Aragon as regent should Juan die, ensuring alliance continuity. Roll 47 (The Burden Shared): The Emperor admits he has not spoken honestly to anyone in years and asks Juan to stay in Constantinople longer. Juan agrees to a few more weeks. The Emperor accepts Juan's request to visit the Hagia Sophia together, proposing both a private visit and a public Sunday liturgy. They conclude with a shared prayer in the church, Juan improvising a moving prayer about Christian brotherhood that leaves the Emperor visibly affected.",

Catalina reaches out and gently touches the Emperor's sleeve, and he weeps openly for the first time in years.

The Asanes patriarch announces the ruling: blood and sacrifice outweigh charter and record. The tribunal recommends House Melissenos receive the prokathemenos of the Strymon Valley upon liberation. Juan honors the judgment, recording House Raoul's title in the document of recognized claims. He invites the bitter Melissenos cousin to the next noble meeting, promising administrators are needed as much as soldiers. The Melissenos grudgingly accepts, vowing House Melissenos will be ready when reconquered lands need governance. The eldest Raoul formally commits to Juan's cause.",

He declines to attend the races or muster, citing pressure from the Patriarch's clergy council and a requested audience from Notaras. Juan writes back addressing each point: he will exempt the tagmata from his command, Roman law is maintained with only mercantile courts introduced, and the Emperor retains co-signature authority over all new laws. Sphrantzes delivers the response and privately advises Juan to mobilize allies before Notaras meets the Emperor.",

Juan proposes removing Notaras's men and reinforcing the tagmata with loyal troops equipped at Juan's expense, led by Greek nobles rather than Latins. The eldest Raoul is offered captaincy of the tagmata. A formal Charter of the Imperial Tagmata is drafted establishing the guard's independence from all outside authority including the Defensor, with equipment funded by Juan's donation of 200 florins. Juan signs the charter, voluntarily limiting his own power. Philanthropenos takes the signed document to present to the Emperor that night.",

Roll 78 (The Dam Breaks): As Philanthropenos reaches for the parchment, the Emperor grabs the quill and signs before the document can be taken. His hand shakes so badly the first letter is nearly illegible, but the signature and imperial seal are affixed.
