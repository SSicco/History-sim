Alfonso agrees to lend Aragonese and Neapolitan fleets for transport when the Ottoman conflict comes, promises free passage for Castilian armies through all ports from Barcelona to Taranto, and commits Aragon and Naples to defending Constantinople with contributions determined by consultation. They agree to draft a formal treaty of free passage and mutual support. Juan shares his five-year strategic vision: build Constantinople's strength, then launch a campaign through Hungary combined with an attack from the city to retake the Anastasian Wall. Alfonso pledges to fight beside Juan personally when the time comes. Alfonso declines further military help to consolidate Naples, stating he must earn authority with his own hand.",

Juan frames the military buildup as defensive investment protection and turns the question back on the Sultan. The Sultan proposes a meeting on neutral ground at the island of Tenedos with fifty guards each. Juan accepts but defers to next year due to Lucia's pregnancy. Hamza Bey reveals the Sultan called Juan 'dangerous' and says Juan would make either a worthy enemy or a valuable arrangement.",

Lucia insists on addressing women's concerns specifically. Juan orders the Military Orders to increase their Constantinople garrison from 715 to 1,000 men and establish permanent commanderies, with a new mission charter to be formalized upon return to Castile. Roll 99 = Extraordinary Transformation: Over the next two years, more than 5,000 settlers arrive in Constantinople. The Pope endorses enthusiastically, mendicant orders preach it fervently, entire families relocate, Italian city-states compete for trading privileges, and the Military Orders petition to make Constantinople their primary headquarters.
