Intelligence reveals Sultan Yusuf has adopted a defensive strategy with 7,000 troops in Granada and garrisoned outer fortresses. Juan marches the full army on Illora, arriving March 30. The first week of siege sees strong progress (rolled 71): Pietro discovers a structural weakness in the walls, and a 30-foot breach opens on Day 4. A failed sortie is crushed with 50 Moorish dead and only 5 Castilian.",

The garrison is divided (rolled 56), with a senior officer receptive but Commander Qaid Hamza ibn Fadil deeply suspicious after decades of broken Christian promises. Despite Juan's respectful Arabic greeting, specific guarantees of no forced conversions, and offer of safe conduct with banners, Hamza refuses (rolled 27), unable to risk his people on hope that a Christian king will keep his word. Juan accepts the refusal and prepares for assault.",

Hamza retreats to the castle with 400 troops. Three days of bombardment follow as internal discord intensifies. On the evening of Day 3, a major wall collapse kills 10 civilians. That night, Hamza's officers mutiny and overthrow him (rolled 30), surrendering the castle at dawn. Juan imposes harsher terms than originally offered: only 11 may leave freely, the rest become prisoners until the crusade ends.",

Hamza acknowledges he was wrong as he is led away to captivity at Antequera. Juan takes four days to rest the army, evacuate seriously wounded to Castile, maintain the bombards, and establish Castilian administration in Illora.
