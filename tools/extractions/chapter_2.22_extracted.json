The knights respond with the cry 'Por Castilla y por Cristo!' before dispersing to prepare for departure to Ostia.",

He leaves 10 knights behind as observers, advises the Pope that military force cannot create conviction for the reform, and suggests consulting Cardinal Rochetaillee for uncorrupted men to replace tainted officials. Parentucelli warns that Cardinal Orsini's cooperation has diminished to mere compliance, and Cardinal Condulmer remains estranged. The Pope gives Juan a papal blessing for the Constantinople expedition. Juan then rides to Ostia to rejoin Lucia and Catalina on the ships.",

Queen Joanna II, age 61 and in failing health, has gone silent. Alfonso reveals the coalition against him: Genoa provided ships (commercial rivalry), Milan's Filippo Maria Visconti provided gold (strategic manipulation), and French crown gold may be flowing through Rene's marriage connections. Alfonso's fleet of 14 war galleys and 8 carracks survives but supply routes are harried by Genoese raiders.

The unexpected encounter: Byzantine diplomat Georgios Sphrantzes, protovestiarios to Emperor John VIII, was in Candia bound for Rome with letters for Western kings. He joins Juan aboard. Sphrantzes provides detailed intelligence: Constantinople has fewer than 40,000 inhabitants, walls crumbling despite Juan's 60,000-florin aid, annual Ottoman tribute of ~30,000 florins draining the treasury, Sultan Murad choosing slow strangulation over costly assault. Sphrantzes confirms Don Juan de Sotomayor's 300 knights have been a blessing on the walls. Juan discusses the three options for Constantinople with Sphrantzes, who warns that Byzantine memory of the Fourth Crusade's sack makes any Western alliance suspect. Juan states bluntly that the Filioque need not be resolved but Greeks would need to accept papal primacy, which Sphrantzes admits the Patriarch and people would reject. Juan clarifies that church union is 'a nice bonus, not a requirement' for alliance - words Sphrantzes says are extraordinarily rare from Western princes. Sphrantzes abandons his Rome journey and joins the fleet for Constantinople. The storm passes by April 7.",

Juan corrects Gennadios: 'take inspiration from, not copy' the Latin church. He reframes the question as 'if the Orthodox church turned every effort into winning, what would that look like?' Gennadios engages constructively: monasteries tithing gold and grain, processions with icons and relics, creating a holy cause rather than military orders, shaming those who hoard while soldiers die. Philanthropenos engages on military strategy: holding walls to bleed the Ottomans, buying time for greed to draw Hungary and Poland into attacking vulnerable Ottoman flanks.
