      "summary": "Continuation of the Byzantine planning council at the Palace of Blachernae, midday. Kantakouzenos, Philanthropenos, Father Gennadios, and Emperor John VIII resume discussions from the previous night. Kantakouzenos demands concrete military details: where will 100,000 men come from, under whose command, and with what supply lines? Juan outlines the grand alliance plan (Castile, Aragon, Naples, Portugal, Hungary, Poland, Venice, Genoa, papal crusade) but acknowledges the many conditions required. Gennadios raises the critical timing problem: if Constantinople publicly chooses to fight, Murad will learn within days and could field 60,000 men before the alliance is built. Juan proposes reinforcing the city with 2,000 additional men and cannons, plus 40,000 from Castile via fleet. Kantakouzenos engages practically with cannon requirements: heavy bombards for counter-battery fire, lighter serpentines for wall defense, and vast quantities of powder and shot. A goldsmith guild representative offers that Byzantine foundries can cast bombards locally if Castile supplies copper and tin.",

Kantakouzenos explains the pronoia system has collapsed since the Empire has no land left to grant. Wealthy nobles like Notaras derive their power from trade partnerships with Italian houses, Black Sea commerce, and tax farming. The Emperor admits he rules by consent of men who could buy his palace. Juan proposes allowing all Latin Christians to own property throughout Constantinople, provoking sharp reactions. The cloth merchant Andreas protests the destruction of Greek commercial privilege. Kantakouzenos sees military logic in Latin investment creating more defenders. Gennadios warns of 'union by demography' undermining Orthodox identity. The Emperor asks if saving Constantinople means making it no longer Constantinople. Juan proposes a foundational law: all Christians equal under law, same rights and obligations, required to man walls during siege and pay taxes. The shipwright suggests grandfathering new rights for new settlers while preserving existing quarter arrangements.",

Father Gennadios recounts the 1182 massacre of Latins in Constantinople and the 1204 Latin sack in retaliation, explaining why Italian quarters maintain separate courts and walls. Juan pivots to noble military obligations. Kantakouzenos reports the nobles collectively command perhaps 800-1,000 household guards, with Notaras alone holding 300. Juan proposes mandatory noble military obligation: every noble must provide men-at-arms when called. Kantakouzenos supports this, Gennadios sees benefits but warns the Patriarch and Notaras will resist. Juan declares he will break or bend those who oppose, that if given command he will end old privilege and enforce equal obligation. Gennadios warns that the Juan who sits before them today may be sincere, but power corrupts, and future kings may not honor today's promises.",

Juan proposes the Byzantine crown itself, suggesting his infant son Fernando could marry a future Byzantine princess and unite the dynasties. This provokes deep emotion from Emperor John VIII, who articulates the weight of 1,500 years of Roman imperial tradition. The Emperor describes what giving up the title would mean: ending a line from Augustus through Constantine. He asks 'how do I sign away everything my ancestors lived and died for?' Juan argues that crowns mean nothing if everyone is dead, and proposes the Emperor could become 'King of the Greeks' while Juan takes the imperial title. The council is adjourned at near-dawn for rest, with a plan to continue the following day. The Emperor agrees to discuss the proposals with his advisors overnight.",

He provides four concrete policy suggestions: fast commercial courts for dispute resolution, clear property title protections, clarification of military obligations for merchants (contributions through supply and taxes rather than fighting), and a neutral Latin commercial court with multinational judges for inter-Latin disputes. Juan proposes crown-appointed tax assessors to replace corrupt tax farming. Contarini paints a vivid picture of what a reformed Constantinople could become: 20,000-30,000 new residents within five years, trade booming at the crossroads of East and West.

Anna says she does not care what language newcomers speak if her children live. Theodoros notes Castilian knights already share bread on the walls. Demetrios speaks of the people's longing for something to believe in. The practical discussion includes joint races with Italian competitors (Venetians and Genoese agree to participate in separate heats initially), Castilian infrastructure work beyond walls (aqueducts, cisterns, streets), and the principle that everyone contributes: nobles with men-at-arms, monks with prayer and care, traders with supplies and taxes.",

      "summary": "The council addresses church obligations. Juan proposes all must contribute within their means, including the church paying one-tenth to the crown. Father Gennadios acknowledges this is unprecedented for the Orthodox Church but admits monasteries hoard wealth while walls crumble. He warns the Patriarch will call it sacrilege and preach against it from every pulpit, but younger clergy may accept it if the tithe visibly funds defense. Gennadios asks for guarantees of church autonomy in return. The chapter concludes mid-discussion, with the document still being drafted. Key outcomes of the chapter: the Emperor has refused to participate, Notaras and the Patriarch form an opposition coalition, but Juan has built a diverse grassroots coalition including Byzantine commoners, military commanders, and both Italian trading communities.",
