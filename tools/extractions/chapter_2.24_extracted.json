      "summary": "Continuing the evening council at the Palace of Blachernae, Juan addresses Father Gennadios Scholarios's question about church taxation guarantees. Juan withdraws the direct taxation proposal, recognizing it violates Orthodox tradition, and instead asks Gennadios to develop a voluntary contribution framework. Gennadios proposes the Apokatastasis — a theological concept of sacred restoration of Orthodox lands — as the Orthodox alternative to the Latin crusade. The framework includes: (1) Anastasis theology framing the defense as divine restoration, (2) Martyria — inscription in the Diptychs of Hagia Sophia for contributors rather than Latin-style indulgences, (3) voluntary donations of grain, gold, horses, and monks as healers from monasteries, (4) a local Synod of exiled bishops issuing a formal Tomos. Gennadios retires to the scriptorium to draft the Tomos of Apokatastasis through the night, acknowledging this will make him the Patriarch's permanent enemy.",

      "summary": "The evening council turns to establishing commercial and criminal courts for Constantinople. Juan proposes a rotating tribunal system where disputes between two nations are adjudicated by a third neutral party, with Castile serving as initial arbiter. Both Contarini (Venice) and Lomellini (Genoa) agree to accept Juan's binding judgment in the Fieschi murder case as a precedent-setting test. The court structure is defined: lex mercatoria for commercial disputes, Byzantine/Roman law (Basilika/Justinian) for criminal matters, anyone can bring a case, extradition for fugitives, judges selected for impartiality, full range of punishments available including death, and Roman appeal system. Contarini and Lomellini draft the Charter of the Latin Courts together through the night — old rivals finding common ground in legal architecture. Juan clarifies this system will be ratified formally only when the city accepts him as Defensor, but the Fieschi trial will prove it works.",

Juan orders: reinstate the urban militia with regular drilling, reinstate pronoia obligations with enforcement, and design a new thematic system for reconquered lands using a three-tier approach (infantry obligation for all males, cavalry for larger landholders, professional standing core). Juan declines the title of Emperor and instead accepts Kantakouzenos's suggestion of 'Defensor Romaniae' — Defender of the Roman realm — with supreme command of all military forces, land and sea. Kantakouzenos and a scribe draft the Taktikon of Romania through the night, establishing the complete military obligations framework.",

Religious freedom is guaranteed: no forced conversion, mixed-marriage households choose their faith at the wedding ceremony. Juan pledges that acceptance means he will commit Castile, and eventually Aragon, Naples, and Sicily to Constantinople's defense. Cultural citizenship is left as personal choice for now.

The 'everyone fights' principle resonates with common people resentful of noble privilege. Thirty-seven new people approach wanting to know more. Notaras's agents find less purchase than yesterday — the comprehensive documents make simple denunciations harder.

Juan will supply bronze ore for cannon foundries. Juan shares his Granada campaign experience: baiting the Moorish sultan with exposed bombards, crushing cavalry charge against exhausted force-marchers, reducing fortresses with cannon fire, protecting supply lines with cavalry, and founding a military academy to study Ottoman tactics (ten officers brought on this expedition). Kantakouzenos is deeply impressed by the academy concept and requests officers remain to share knowledge.

Philanthropenos explains which titles have living claimants (Kantakouzenoi claim Adrianople, Asanes claim Mesembria) and which are vacant. The Duchy of Thessalonica — the second city, whose last Palaiologos holder died in 1430 with no clear heir — is conditionally granted to House Philanthropenos.
