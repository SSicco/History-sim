Five members accept: Juan de Daza (treasury), Diego Gómez de Sandoval (court factions), Lope de Barrientos (Church networks), Íñigo López de Mendoza (Mendoza observer), and Rodrigo Manrique (frontier military). Juan challenges them with frank terms about danger and loyalty. Rodrigo provides a detailed briefing on the Granada frontier: 500 miles of low-intensity conflict, informal truces between frontier lords and Moors, and the reality that many nobles profit from perpetual war rather than actual conquest.",

This should be a success by default unless I roll for it, but the user hasn't proposed an action that needs a roll yet. They're just setting the scene for the meeting.\n\nI should:\n1. Describe the return journey from Medina del Campo\n2. Set the scene in the palace\n3. Describe the assembled cabinet members\n4. Have them introduce themselves or be introduced\n5. Wait for Juan to direct the meeting and explain why he's gathered them\n\nThe timeline: The meeting at Medina del Campo happened on May 6, 1430. It's now probably later that same day (if it's a 30-mile ride back) or the next day (May 7) depending on when they departed.\n\nLet me create an immersive scene that introduces all these characters properly.\n\nChapter 2: The Young King's Gambit (Continued)\n\nReturn to Valladolid - May 6, 1430, Evening\n\nThe ride back from Medina del Campo passes in contemplative silence. The spring sun hangs low over the Castilian plains as your party approaches Valladolid, the city's walls and towers catching the golden light. Captain Fernán rides close, occasionally glancing your way with an unreadable expression. Álvaro maintains his usual composed mask, though you catch him studying you several times with what might be concern, or perhaps admiration.\n\nAs you pass through the city gates, the guards snap to attention with noticeably better discipline than a week ago. The new equipment has already had an effect.\n\nRoyal Palace, Valladolid - Private Council Chamber\n\nThe chamber Álvaro has prepared is smaller than the grand audience halls—deliberately so. It's a working room: a long oak table, high-backed chairs, good light from tall windows overlooking the inner courtyard. Maps of Castile hang on the walls alongside a crucifix. Wine and water have been set out, along with writing materials.\n\nThey are all here.\n\nAs you enter, five men rise from their chairs. Some you've met briefly; others are new faces. All show varying degrees of curiosity, calculation, or concern about why the young king has summoned them.\n\nJuan de Daza (standing near the treasury documents):\nAge ~40, dressed in sober dark wool, the clothing of a prosperous merchant or official rather than a noble. Thinning hair, ink-stained fingers, sharp eyes that seem to catalogue everything. He carries himself with the careful dignity of a commoner who has risen through competence. You met him three days ago and assigned him to track financial flows in Valladolid.\n\nDiego Gómez de Sandoval, Count of Castro (by the window):\nAge 32, wearing well-made but understated noble attire. His converso heritage is known but rarely remarked upon—his family has been Christian for two generations and he's proven himself in both court and field. Dark beard, intelligent eyes, the bearing of someone comfortable in multiple worlds. You also met him three days ago, tasking him to observe court factions.\n\nLope de Barrientos (seated, studying a manuscript):\nAge ~38, Dominican robes marking him clearly. From Salamanca, he has the bearing of a scholar—slightly disheveled, but with penetrating eyes that suggest a mind always working. He looks up as you enter, and there's something reassuring in his direct gaze. No courtly polish, but clear intelligence.\n\nÍñigo López de Mendoza (standing with perfect posture):\nAge ~28, perhaps the youngest in the room after yourself. From the powerful Mendoza family, but not the head of it. Fine clothing showing wealth and taste. There's poetry in how he moves, and his eyes observe everything with the attention of someone who will later put it into verse. Handsome, cultured, but you sense steel beneath the refinement.\n\nRodrigo Manrique (near the door):\nAge ~40, scarred face, practical frontier clothing under a well-worn cloak. A soldier through and through, from a respected military family. He looks slightly uncomfortable indoors, like a wolf brought into a sitting room. His hand rests habitually near where a sword would hang. Blunt, capable, dangerous.\n\nÁlvaro de Luna stands to one side, having orchestrated this gathering but now deliberately remaining peripheral. Captain Fernán has taken a post by the door—close enough to hear, far enough to show this is not his meeting.\n\nAll eyes turn to you.\n\nThe room holds its breath, waiting to understand why these particular five men—so different in background and expertise—have been summoned by their young king on the very day he returned from meeting the Infantes de Aragón.\n\nWhat do you wish to say or do?"

I can not be everywhere nor see or hear everything. That is where you come in. I need opinions on how the clergy regards my rule and how they might view my pilgrimage for instance. I also need to have the commoner's perspective. I want to understand my subjects.\n\n\nI am looking forward to getting to know you all, but first of all, do you accept this position?

          "text": "1. **Juan de Daza** - Commoner, treasury official. Would be honored but also pragmatic. He knows money doesn't grow on trees and the treasury is strained. He'd likely accept but might have practical concerns.\n\n2. **Diego Gómez de Sandoval** - Converso noble. This is a significant opportunity for someone whose family faces occasional discrimination. Would likely be very interested but cautious.\n\n3. **Lope de Barrientos** - Dominican scholar from Salamanca. Church networks. Would care more about influence and purpose than money. Might want to understand the role better.\n\n4. **Íñigo López de Mendoza** - Young Mendoza. This is politically significant - being in the king's inner circle. But his family is powerful and he needs to be careful about family politics.\n\n5. **Rodrigo Manrique** - Frontier soldier. Direct, blunt. Would want to know what he's actually supposed to do.\n\nThe promise of \"all the prestige you want and all the money you need\" is quite generous - perhaps too generous given the treasury situation. Some of these men would know that. It's also a bit naive - prestige doesn't come from promises, it comes from association with power and success.\n\nI should have them respond in character. Some acceptance, some questions, some concerns. They would need to understand what this actually means - what are their duties, what authority do they have, what risks are they taking by associating closely with the king?\n\nAlso, Juan just came back from meeting with the Infantes. These men might wonder what that meeting produced and how it affects their positions.\n\nThe First Cabinet Meeting\n\nYour words hang in the air. The five men exchange glances—some quick, others more lingering. There's a moment of collective assessment as each measures not just your offer, but each other.\n\nRodrigo Manrique breaks the silence first, his frontier bluntness cutting through the formality:\n\n\"Your Majesty, I'm a soldier. I know how to scout, how to read enemy movements, how to kill Moors and stay alive doing it.\" He shifts his weight, uncomfortable but direct. \"What you're describing—this 'cabinet'—what exactly do you want me to do? Attend meetings? Write reports? I'm not a courtier.\"\n\nLope de Barrientos sets down his manuscript, his scholar's mind already working:\n\n\"Your Majesty asks about how the clergy views your rule and your pilgrimage.\" He pauses, choosing words carefully. \"But prestige and money are not what move the Church. Purpose moves the Church. Authority moves the Church. Legitimacy moves the Church.\" His eyes are sharp. \"What authority would we wield in your name? Are we to observe and report? To advise in private? To act as your representatives in our respective... spheres?\"\n\nJuan de Daza clears his throat, ink-stained fingers drumming once on the table:\n\n\"Your Majesty, I am honored beyond measure. Truly.\" His tone is respectful but carries the careful precision of a man who works with numbers. \"You say 'all the money you need'—the treasury currently runs at perhaps two million maravedís surplus in good years. If I may speak plainly... what resources are actually available for this enterprise? And...\" he hesitates, then continues, \"...what protection do we have? Men who advise kings sometimes become targets for those who would prefer the king receive... different counsel.\"\n\nDiego Gómez de Sandoval steps forward from the window, his nobleman's grace evident:\n\n\"My family has served Castile for generations, Your Majesty. I accept, of course.\" He bows. \"But Count Manrique's question deserves answer. What specifically do you require of each of us? And—\" he glances at the others, \"—do the Infantes de Aragón know you are building this... cabinet?\"\n\nÍñigo López de Mendoza speaks last, his cultured voice measured:\n\n\"Your Majesty, I am young, and my uncle the Marquis de Santillana is the head of our house. I would be honored to serve you personally.\" He pauses delicately. \"But I must ask: is this service to you, or to your Constable?\" A meaningful glance toward Álvaro de Luna. \"My family will want to know where loyalties lie. No offense intended to Don Álvaro, who serves brilliantly, but... the nobility speaks much these days of who truly governs Castile.\"\n\nÁlvaro de Luna remains perfectly still by the wall, his face unreadable. Captain Fernán watches with a soldier's alertness, hand resting on his sword hilt.\n\nThe five men haven't refused—but they're asking the hard questions. What exactly is this position? What power comes with it? What danger? Whose creature will they be seen as—yours, or Álvaro's?\n\nAnd underlying it all: they can sense something has happened today. You've returned from meeting the Infantes, and now you're suddenly forming this inner council. They want to know what storm is coming, and whether standing close to you will provide shelter or make them targets.\n\nHow do you respond to their questions?"

Rodgigo asks how killing Moors can possibly be of help. I will tell you Rodrigo. When I have a meeting with my nobles, everyone is suddenly an expert in killing Moors, even those who have yet to see one bearing arms. Among all this clutter, I would like to have someone who I can actually trust and knows what he is talking about. That will be your task. \nSome of you also ask about your compensation. Let me assure you the crown is more than capable to pay you fairly for your services. But this is no money grab. The money you NEED, not want. \nAs for concerns for your safety; yes there will be danger. I will not hide you away from anyone, especially not the infantes. Anyone hurting you will be hurting the crown. The protection offered to me extends to you as well. But if you fear death more than this opportunity, you clearly are not the right man."

          "text": "This is quite bold for an 18-year-old king. He's speaking with authority and a bit of edge. The men will react to this based on their personalities. Some will respect the directness, others might be concerned about the danger he's admitting, some will appreciate the clarity.\n\nLet me think about each character's likely response:\n- Rodrigo Manrique: Soldier, blunt. Will probably respect the straight talk and the practical role.\n- Juan de Daza: Careful, practical. Might be reassured by clarity but still concerned about specifics.\n- Lope de Barrientos: Scholar, thoughtful. Will want to understand the purpose more deeply.\n- Diego Gómez de Sandoval: Noble, sophisticated. Will appreciate the clear lines of loyalty.\n- Íñigo López de Mendoza: Young noble, poet. His Mendoza family question has been addressed but he'll need to consider family politics.\n\nThe challenge about \"if you fear death\" is quite pointed. It's essentially calling out anyone who hesitates as a coward. That's a strong move - could backfire or could earn respect.\n\nThe Cabinet Accepts\n\nThe room's temperature seems to shift with your words. You've laid down a challenge, drawn a clear line, and made the stakes explicit. No one can mistake this for a ceremonial position or a sinecure.\n\nRodrigo Manrique barks a short, harsh laugh—the first genuine sound of amusement in the room:\n\n\"Hah! Finally, someone who admits most nobles couldn't tell a Moorish cavalry charge from a donkey cart.\" He steps forward and drops to one knee with surprising grace for a scarred veteran. \"Your Majesty, I've faced death on the frontier for twenty years. I don't fear it—I just wanted to know the terms.\" He looks up, eyes hard and honest. \"You want someone who knows war and Moors and won't bullshit you? You have him. I accept.\"\n\nJuan de Daza relaxes slightly, the tension leaving his shoulders:\n\n\"'Need, not want.' That is... clarifying, Your Majesty.\" He bows, more at ease now. \"I apologize if I seemed grasping. In my world, one learns to establish terms clearly before beginning work.\" A slight smile. \"I accept. You will have accurate information about where the crown's money flows, and where it... doesn't arrive as intended.\" There's steel in that last phrase—he's already thinking about corruption.\n\nDiego Gómez de Sandoval moves forward with a nobleman's practiced grace, but there's real conviction in his voice:\n\n\"Your Majesty, you answer the question my family would ask. We serve the crown, not factions.\" He kneels smoothly. \"And you're right—if the Infantes see us as your men, that is what we are. Better to stand in clear daylight than skulk in shadows pretending neutrality. I accept, and I will observe and report on the court factions with clear eyes.\"\n\nLope de Barrientos rises from his seat, his Dominican robes rustling:\n\n\"Your Majesty, the Church teaches that wisdom comes from counsel, and that a king who seeks advice shows strength, not weakness.\" He bows his tonsured head. \"You ask about the clergy's view of your pilgrimage—I accept this charge. I will tell you what the bishops whisper, what the monasteries pray for, and whether Rome will see your devotion as genuine or political.\" He pauses. \"And I accept the danger. Dominican martyrs are numerous. We do not flinch.\"\n\nÍñigo López de Mendoza remains standing, and the room's attention focuses on him. He's the one with the most to lose—the Mendoza family is powerful, and being seen as the king's creature without family approval could be dangerous.\n\nHe takes a breath, and when he speaks, it's with the precision of a poet choosing exactly the right words:\n\n\"Your Majesty, I am the youngest son of a powerful house. My elder brothers will lead our family. My cousins command armies. What am I to do with my life—write verses and attend banquets?\"\n\nHe steps forward, and there's something almost fierce in his cultured face:\n\n\"You offer me purpose. You offer me a role that matters. Yes, my uncle will be concerned. Yes, the Infantes will note this. Yes, there is danger.\" He kneels, and his voice drops but doesn't lose intensity. \"But you are my king, anointed by God and crowned by the Church. If I cannot serve you because powerful men might disapprove, then what kind of man am I? What kind of poetry would I write—verses about cowardice?\"\n\nHe looks up:\n\n\"I accept. I will observe the nobility as you command. And I will tell my uncle the Marquis that I serve Castile's rightful king, and that this service honors our house, not shames it.\"\n\nAll five men are now committed. Some kneel, some stand, but all have crossed the threshold.\n\nÁlvaro de Luna finally moves from his position by the wall. He doesn't smile—that would be unlike him—but something eases in his bearing:\n\n\"Your Majesty has chosen well,\" he says quietly. \"And now they know the truth: you are building something real.\"\n\nCaptain Fernán by the door nods once, approvingly. These are men who've committed despite the danger, not because they were promised safety.\n\nRodrigo Manrique, still kneeling, looks up with soldier's pragmatism:\n\n\"So, Your Majesty, what do you need to know first? About the frontier? The Granada situation? Or...\" he glances at the others, \"...whatever happened at Medina del Campo today that made you suddenly need advisors you can trust?\"\n\nThe question hangs in the air. They've accepted. They've committed. Now they want to know what they've gotten themselves into.\n\nDo you tell them about the Infantes meeting and the agreement you've reached? Do you reveal the pilgrimage plan? Or do you start with something else?"

          "text": "Now he's asking Rodrigo about the frontier and the military orders. This is a crucial area - the Granada frontier, the ongoing Reconquista, and the powerful military orders (Santiago, Calatrava, Alcántara) are major factors in Castilian politics and military power.\n\nLet me have Rodrigo give him a realistic, blunt assessment of:\n1. The current state of the Granada frontier\n2. Military order politics and their relationship with the crown\n3. The actual military situation vs. what nobles at court might say\n\nThis should be informative and help Juan understand the real military/frontier situation, which will be important for his crusade plans.\n\nThe Frontier Reality\n\nRodrigo rises as you clasp his shoulder, and there's genuine respect in how he straightens. A king who touches a scarred soldier as an equal has already earned something.\n\nHe moves to the map of Castile on the wall, his scarred hand tracing the southern frontier:\n\n\"The frontier, Your Majesty, is not one thing. It's five hundred miles of border from the Portuguese frontier to Murcia, and every stretch has its own reality.\"\n\nHe taps different sections as he speaks, his voice taking on the cadence of a man who's lived what he describes:\n\nThe Frontier Situation\n\n\"The Western Frontier - Jaén, Úbeda, Baeza:\"\n\n\"This is where I've spent most of my years. Constant raiding both ways. The Moors come out of Granada in spring and summer—hit a village, take livestock, capture Christians for ransom or slavery. We do the same to them. It's... organized chaos. Both sides know the game.\"\n\nHe glances at you directly:\n\n\"Here's what the nobles in Valladolid won't tell you: most frontier lords have informal truces with their Moorish counterparts. They raid each other's peasants, yes, but there are rules. Messengers pass safely. Ransom negotiations happen. Sometimes they even warn each other about bigger threats.\"\n\n\"Why? Because total war would devastate everyone. The land would become worthless. So it's this... permanent low-intensity conflict. Enough to justify the frontier nobles' importance and income, not enough to actually threaten Granada's existence or cost the frontier lords everything.\"\n\n\"The Eastern Frontier - Murcia:\"\n\n\"Quieter. More trade actually. The Kingdom of Murcia has been Christian longer, the population is more mixed. Still Muslim villages paying tribute, Christian lords who've been there for generations. The raiding is less intense. Some might say it's more civilized.\" A slight sneer suggests what he thinks of \"civilized.\"\n\n\"The Central Frontier - Around Granada itself:\"\n\n\"The most fortified. The vega of Granada—their richest farmland—is heavily defended. Major fortresses on both sides. This is where any real campaign would have to focus. And Your Majesty, here's the hard truth: Granada's walls are strong. Their cavalry is excellent. And they're not divided like we are—Muhammad IX al-Aysar rules effectively right now.\"\n\nHe turns from the map:\n\n\"Any noble who tells you Granada could be conquered in one campaign season is either lying or ignorant. It would take years, enormous resources, and unified command. Things Castile hasn't had in living memory.\"\n\nThe Military Orders\n\nRodrigo's expression darkens slightly:\n\n\"The Orders—Santiago, Calatrava, Alcántara—here's what you need to know:\"\n\n\"They should be your most reliable military force. Knight-monks, sworn to the Reconquista, theoretically loyal to the crown and the Pope. Wealthy—they own vast estates across Castile. They can field thousands of trained knights and men-at-arms.\"\n\nHe pauses, choosing words carefully:\n\n\"But they've become political players. The Masters of the Orders aren't chosen by God or the Pope anymore—they're chosen by whoever has the most influence. And right now...\"\n\nJuan de Daza interjects quietly from his position:\n\n\"The Master of Santiago is Luis de Guzmán, isn't he? Allied with the Infantes' faction?\"\n\nRodrigo nods grimly:\n\n\"Exactly. And Calatrava's Master, García López de Padilla, plays all sides. Only Alcántara's Master, Gutierre de Sotomayor, might be genuinely neutral—and even that's because Alcántara is the smallest and poorest Order.\"\n\nHe faces you directly:\n\n\"Your Majesty, the Orders could be the spine of a crusade against Granada. But right now? They're noble factions in monastic robes. If you called for a crusade tomorrow, you'd have to ask yourself: would they follow your command, or would their Masters use it as leverage for political concessions?\"\n\nLope de Barrientos speaks up from his seat, his scholarly voice adding context:\n\n\"The Orders were founded for holy war, Your Majesty. Their original purpose was pure. But generations have passed, and they've become... complicated. Rich, politically entangled, focused on preserving their privileges as much as fighting Moors.\"\n\nDiego Gómez de Sandoval adds from the window:\n\n\"And the frontier nobles depend on the existence of the Moorish threat. If Granada fell tomorrow, what would justify their special privileges? Their military exemptions? Their frontier subsidies?\" He lets that hang. \"Some frontier lords profit more from eternal conflict than they would from actual victory.\"\n\nRodrigo crosses his arms, summarizing bluntly:\n\n\"So here's your reality, Your Majesty: The frontier is active but controlled—more profitable as eternal border war than as conquest. The Military Orders are militarily powerful but politically compromised. The frontier nobles talk crusade at court but practice coexistence at home. And Granada is strong, unified, and not going anywhere unless someone commits to real war.\"\n\nHe leans forward:\n\n\"Now, if you're planning something—and I'm guessing you are, given this sudden cabinet—tell me: are you thinking of actual conquest? Or are you thinking of using the idea of crusade for something else?\"\n\nThe veteran's eyes are sharp. He's seen through to the political dimension.\n\nThe other cabinet members are watching your reaction carefully. They've just heard an assessment that contradicts much of what's said publicly at court. Rodrigo has essentially told you that the Reconquista has become performative politics rather than genuine holy war.\n\nHow do you respond? Do you share your crusade plans with this new cabinet?"

But the others might chime in too with their perspectives - Lope on religious/crusade aspects, Juan de Daza on financing, Diego on political feasibility, Íñigo on noble sentiment.\n\nThis should be a realistic assessment of what it would actually take to conquer Granada in 1430. Historically, Granada didn't fall until 1492, so this is 62 years early. It would be genuinely difficult but not impossible.\n\nKey factors:\n- Military: Need unified command, sustained campaign over multiple years, siege warfare capability\n- Financial: Enormous cost, need reliable funding\n- Political: Need noble unity or at least compliance, prevent backstabbing during campaign\n- Religious: Papal support would help immensely (crusade bull, indulgences, international participation)\n- Diplomatic: Prevent Aragon or others from interfering, possibly neutralize Morocco/North African support for Granada\n- Strategic: Need to take key fortresses sequentially, can't just march on Granada city\n\nRodrigo should give a sobering but not impossible assessment. He's a practical military man.\n\nThe Reality of Conquest\n\nRodrigo takes a breath, clearly organizing his thoughts. This is a question he's probably considered many times on cold frontier nights. He returns to the map, and the other cabinet members lean in—this is why they're here, to hear truth instead of courtly platitudes.\n\n\"Your Majesty asks the right question. Not should we conquer Granada, but how.\" He traces the frontier line. \"I've spent twenty years fighting Moors. Here's what it would actually take.\"\n\nMilitary Requirements\n\n\"First: Unified Command\"\n\n\"This is the biggest problem. Every frontier noble thinks he's a military genius. Every Master of the Military Orders wants glory. Everyone wants to command their own forces their own way.\" His finger stabs the map emphatically. \"Granada survives because we are divided and they are united.\"\n\n\"You'd need one supreme commander—not a council of nobles arguing while the Moors fortify. Someone with absolute authority over all forces, answerable only to you. And Your Majesty...\" he looks at you directly, \"...the nobles would hate this. They'd see it as tyranny.\"\n\n\"Second: A Real Army\"\n\n\"Not feudal levies that go home for harvest. Not knights who show up for forty days and leave. A professional force that can campaign for years if needed.\"\n\nJuan de Daza interjects, his treasurer's mind already calculating:\n\n\"That means paying soldiers. Continuously. For years. Your Majesty, our current annual revenue barely covers peacetime expenses...\"\n\nRodrigo nods grimly:\n\n\"He's right. You'd need money. Lots of it. But more on that later.\"\n\nHe continues:\n\n\"Realistically, you'd need fifteen to twenty thousand men minimum. Infantry, cavalry, siege engineers, supply train. And they'd need to be sustained—fed, paid, equipped, replaced when they die. The Moors will make us bleed for every fortress.\"\n\n\"Third: Siege Capability\"\n\n\"Granada isn't one city. It's dozens of fortresses protecting the capital. Each one would need to be besieged and taken.\" He points to locations on the map:\n\n\"Málaga. Almería. Baza. Guadix. Ronda. Each is heavily fortified. Each could hold out for months. You'd need siege engines, engineers who know their craft, patience, and willingness to accept losses.\"\n\nLope de Barrientos adds quietly:\n\n\"The Moorish fortifications are formidable. They've learned from centuries of war. This would not be like raiding—this would be systematic reduction of prepared defenses.\"\n\nStrategic Approach\n\nRodrigo traces a path on the map:\n\n\"If I were planning this—truly planning it, not court fantasy—here's what I'd do:\"\n\n\"Phase One: Secure the Western Approaches (1-2 years)\"\n\n\"Start here.\" He points to the western frontier. \"Take the fortresses west of Granada—Alhama, Zahara, Ronda. These cut Granada off from potential Moroccan reinforcement across the strait. And they're further from Granada's main strength.\"\n\n\"This also tests your army. Builds experience. Shows the nobles you're serious. And most importantly—early victories bring in more support and funding.\"\n\n\"Phase Two: Strangle the Economy (2-3 years)\"\n\n\"Granada is rich because of the vega—the farmland around the capital. You systematically take or destroy it. Cut their food supply. Raid their trade routes. Make every caravan from North Africa run a gauntlet.\"\n\n\"This is brutal, unglamorous work. Burning crops, killing peasants or driving them into the city. The nobles won't like it—no glory in burning wheat fields. But it's how you win.\"\n\n\"Phase Three: Eastern Fortresses (2-3 years)\"\n\n\"While Granada starves, take Baza, Guadix, Almería. Surround them. At this point, if you've done everything right, Granada city is isolated, weakened, and running out of food.\"\n\n\"Phase Four: The Final Siege (1-2 years)\"\n\n\"Only then do you besiege Granada itself. And even then, it could take a year or more. Their walls are magnificent. They'll fight street by street.\"\n\nHe steps back from the map:\n\n\"Total timeline? Eight to ten years minimum. More likely twelve to fifteen if things go badly—and things always go badly in war.\"\n\nThe Hard Requirements\n\nDiego Gómez de Sandoval speaks up, his nobleman's perspective adding political reality:\n\n\"Rodrigo's timeline assumes noble cooperation for a decade. Your Majesty, most nobles can barely cooperate for a single campaign season. After one or two years, they'd start demanding rewards, honors, arguing over spoils, going home...\"\n\nJuan de Daza adds the financial dimension:\n\n\"Your Majesty, current annual revenue is roughly thirty million maravedís. A campaign of this scale would cost...\" he calculates mentally, \"...twenty to thirty million per year just for the army, not counting fortifications, equipment losses, contingencies. You'd need to double royal revenue and sustain it for a decade.\"\n\nLope de Barrientos provides the religious angle:\n\n\"A Papal crusade bull would help immensely. It would provide religious legitimacy, allow you to levy special crusade taxes, attract foreign knights seeking indulgences. Without papal backing, this is just another border war. With it, it becomes a holy cause that can inspire and finance itself.\"\n\nÍñigo López de Mendoza adds thoughtfully:\n\n\"And the Infantes de Aragón would need to either support this crusade or be neutralized. If they oppose it, they can paralyze recruitment, block funding, and ensure failure. If they support it...\" he pauses, \"...they'll demand command positions and credit for victories.\"\n\nRodrigo's Assessment\n\nThe veteran crosses his arms and delivers his conclusion:\n\n\"Your Majesty, here's the truth: Granada can be conquered. But it requires things Castile hasn't had in generations:\n\nOne: Unified political will for a decade or more\nTwo: Sustained, reliable funding \nThree: Professional military organization under single command\nFour: Willingness to prosecute total war, not chivalric raiding\nFive: Either neutralization or cooperation of the great nobles\n\n\"Without all five? You'll have another expensive, bloody failure like so many before. A few fortresses taken, lots of glory claimed, Granada still standing, treasury empty, and nobles more fractious than ever.\"\n\nHe looks at you directly:\n\n\"Can it be done? Yes. Will it be easy? Absolutely not. Should you try? That depends on whether you can create the political and financial conditions to sustain it. Otherwise, you're just getting good men killed for nothing.\"\n\nThe room is silent. You've asked for truth, and you've received it. Conquering Granada is possible but would require transforming Castile's entire military, financial, and political structure—exactly the kind of transformation the great nobles would resist.\n\nJuan de Daza ventures carefully:\n\n\"Your Majesty, if I may... the meeting with the Infantes today. Does it relate to these thoughts about Granada? Are you seeking their cooperation for a crusade? Or...\" he hesitates, \"...is the crusade a means to another end?\"\n\nThe cabinet is beginning to see the larger picture. They're wondering what you're really planning.\n\nHow do you respond? Do you reveal your Rome plan and the agreement with the Infantes? Do you share the full strategy, or keep some cards close?"

There is no crusade bull currently in effect for Iberia, nor any signals from Rome that Pope Martin V is considering one.\"\n\nHe folds his hands, settling into explanation mode:\n\n\"The current Pope—Martin V, elected in 1417 after the Council of Constance finally ended the Great Schism—has been focused primarily on rebuilding papal authority after forty years of competing popes. His priorities have been Italian politics, restoring Rome itself, and reestablishing the Church's temporal power.\"\n\nJuan de Daza adds a practical observation:\n\n\"Rome also remembers that Iberian crusade bulls have been... inconsistently successful. The money raised sometimes stays in Castile rather than flowing to Rome. Past bulls were issued, taxes collected, and then the campaigns fizzled.\"\n\nLope nods:\n\n\"True. The last significant crusade bull for Granada was decades ago under Benedict XIII—but he was the Avignon antipope during the Schism, so his bulls are of questionable validity anyway. Martin V has issued no new one.\"\n\nHe looks at you directly:\n\n\"If Your Majesty were to seek such a bull, you would need to petition Rome directly. Send an embassy, or...\" he pauses thoughtfully, \"...in rare cases, monarchs have traveled personally to demonstrate their sincerity. But such a bull is not simply granted. The Pope would want assurances: that you're serious, that funds raised would be properly used, that you have the means to actually prosecute a campaign.\"\n\nDiego Gómez de Sandoval speaks up from his position by the window:\n\n\"Your Majesty, if I may observe—you ask detailed questions about how to conquer Granada, then clarify you have no intention of crusade.\" A slight smile. \"This is either royal curiosity, or you're testing us to see what we know before revealing your true thoughts.\"\n\nRodrigo Manrique grunts:\n\n\"Or he's being smart. A king who announces plans before he's ready is a king who gives his enemies time to prepare.\" The veteran looks at you with approval. \"I don't need to know your intentions, Your Majesty. I need to give you accurate information so whatever you do decide is based on reality, not fantasy.\"\n\nÍñigo López de Mendoza adds with a poet's careful phrasing:\n\n\"And perhaps Your Majesty wishes to understand the full landscape before committing to any course. Wise kings consider many options before choosing one.\" He glances at the others. \"We are here to provide counsel, not to demand confidence before it's earned.\"\n\nJuan de Daza, ever the practical administrator, ventures:\n\n\"Your Majesty, if I may redirect slightly—you mentioned wanting to understand constraints and options. Beyond Granada and crusades, what other information would be valuable? The treasury situation? Noble factions? Trade and taxation? The more we understand what you need to know, the better we can serve.\"\n\nLope de Barrientos adds:\n\n\"Or Church matters beyond crusades? The state of the dioceses, the bishops' loyalties, relations with the religious orders? These things affect royal authority as much as military matters.\"\n\nThey're probing gently, trying to understand what you really need without demanding you reveal plans you're not ready to share. They've accepted that you're playing a careful game—they just want to know how to be useful within it.\n\nÁlvaro de Luna, who has been silent throughout, finally speaks from his position by the wall:\n\n\"Your Majesty demonstrates wisdom. A king who asks 'how would this work' before committing to action is rarer than one might hope.\" There's the slightest emphasis on those words—he's reinforcing your caution while subtly telling the cabinet that yes, there are plans, but they'll be revealed when appropriate.\n\nCaptain Fernán by the door remains watchful, but you catch the briefest nod of approval. You're handling this well.\n\nThe cabinet waits. You've established that you gather information carefully before acting. You've tested their knowledge about Rome and crusades without revealing your intentions. You've learned that there's no current papal crusade, but that such a thing could be sought—with effort.\n\nWhat other information do you want from your new cabinet?

Diego Gómez de Sandoval (the nobleman) and possibly Íñigo López de Mendoza would have good insight into royal family relations. Lope de Barrientos might know about diplomatic history.\n\nThe key tension here is that Juan just made an agreement with the Infantes de Aragón, who are literally from the Aragonese royal family. An alliance with Aragon proper could either strengthen his position or complicate things depending on how Alfonso V views his brothers' activities in Castile.\n\nForeign Relations - Aragon and Portugal\n\nDiego Gómez de Sandoval steps forward, this being clearly his domain as a nobleman familiar with royal lineages and diplomacy:\n\n\"Your Majesty, the situation with Aragon is... complicated by the very men you met today.\"\n\nHe moves to the map, pointing to the eastern kingdoms:\n\nThe Aragon Situation\n\n\"King Alfonso V of Aragon—Alfonso the Magnanimous, they're calling him—is your cousin. He's about thirty-four years old, ambitious, and currently obsessed with Italian affairs. He wants Naples, dreams of Mediterranean empire, spends more time thinking about Italy than Iberia.\"\n\nÍñigo López de Mendoza adds his knowledge:\n\n\"And the Infantes de Aragón—Juan and Enrique—are King Alfonso's younger brothers. Juan is actually King of Navarre through marriage. They have significant estates here in Castile through inheritance from their mother, Queen Eleanor.\"\n\nDiego continues:\n\n\"Here's the fundamental problem, Your Majesty: King Alfonso has not reined in his brothers. Whether he can't or won't is debated. Some say he's content to let them build power in Castile while he focuses on Italy. Others say he's lost control of them entirely.\"\n\nHe pauses, choosing words carefully:\n\n\"An alliance with Aragon? Possible in theory. You share blood. But what would it mean in practice? Would Alfonso order his brothers to stop interfering in Castile? Would he even want to? Or would 'alliance' simply mean formalizing Aragonese influence here?\"\n\nLope de Barrientos interjects with historical context:\n\n\"The Crown of Aragon and Castile have been rivals for centuries, Your Majesty. Sometimes allies against common enemies, yes, but fundamentally competing for dominance in Iberia. Any alliance would need to clearly define what Aragon gains and what Castile doesn't lose.\"\n\nDiego nods:\n\n\"Marriage alliance is the traditional route. You're eighteen and unmarried—Alfonso has sisters, though I'd need to check their current status. Or there might be suitable Aragonese noblewomen. But...\" he hesitates.\n\n\"Your Majesty, any marriage alliance negotiated now, while the Infantes are actively maneuvering in Castile, would be negotiated from weakness. Alfonso would demand concessions. The Infantes would demand guarantees for their position here. You'd be formalizing their power rather than limiting it.\"\n\nThe Portugal Situation\n\nDiego shifts his attention westward on the map:\n\n\"Portugal is different. King João I is elderly now—seventy-three years old, nearing the end of a very long and successful reign. He's focused on his sons' expeditions—they're exploring down the African coast, taking Ceuta, building an ocean-going empire.\"\n\n\"Relations with Castile are... correct. Not warm, but not hostile. The wars of succession from the 1380s are old history now. There's trade, there's peace, but there's also Portuguese wariness of Castilian power.\"\n\nJuan de Daza adds a merchant's perspective:\n\n\"Portugal trades extensively with Flanders, England, and increasingly with Africa. They're becoming wealthy from this trade. An alliance might open commercial opportunities—or might threaten their independence, which they guard jealously.\"\n\nDiego continues:\n\n\"Marriage alliance is possible here too. King João has several children and grandchildren. His son Duarte will inherit soon—he has daughters who might be suitable. Or there are Portuguese noblewomen.\"\n\nHe pauses thoughtfully:\n\n\"Portugal has an advantage as an ally: they're outside Castile's internal politics. An alliance with Portugal doesn't immediately strengthen any particular Castilian faction. It's external support without domestic complications.\"\n\nÍñigo López de Mendoza adds:\n\n\"Though the Portuguese are proud. They won their independence from Castile and won't forget it. Any alliance would need to respect their sovereignty absolutely. They'd rather stay neutral than become subordinate.\"\n\nStrategic Assessment\n\nRodrigo Manrique, the soldier, offers his practical view:\n\n\"Your Majesty, from a military standpoint: Aragon shares a long border with us, has significant military power, and their nobles hold lands in both kingdoms. They're entangled whether we like it or not. Portugal shares a shorter border, has a smaller but professional military, and stays out of our internal mess.\"\n\n\"If you're thinking about Granada: Aragon has Mediterranean interests and Italian distractions. They're not going to commit seriously to Reconquista—they're looking east, not south. Portugal is exploring Africa and might actually be interested in cooperative campaigning against Moorish territories, though they'd want separate commands and clear division of spoils.\"\n\nÁlvaro de Luna speaks from the wall, his voice quiet but carrying weight:\n\n\"Your Majesty, the question is not just alliance, but timing. Any negotiation with Aragon right now happens in the shadow of your agreement with the Infantes. Any approach to Portugal will be interpreted through the lens of Castilian internal politics—are you seeking external support because you're weak domestically?\"\n\nHe lets that hang in the air.\n\nDiego Gómez de Sandoval summarizes:\n\n\"To answer your question directly, Your Majesty:\n\nAragon: Alliance is possible but complicated by the Infantes' position. King Alfonso might be receptive, but what would he demand? And would alliance help you control his brothers, or give them more legitimacy? This requires careful diplomacy and probably negotiation from a position of greater strength than you currently hold.\n\nPortugal: Alliance is possible and cleaner—fewer domestic complications. They're cautious but rational. A marriage alliance could be negotiated relatively straightforwardly if you offer respect and mutual benefit. They won't save you from internal threats, but they won't make them worse either.\n\nNeither alliance would solve your immediate problems with the nobility. Both would require concessions. And both would be interpreted differently depending on when and how you pursue them.\"\n\nThe cabinet watches your reaction. You've asked about foreign alliances, and they've given you the uncomfortable truth: you're negotiating from weakness right now, and foreign powers know it.\n\nJuan de Daza ventures carefully:\n\n\"Your Majesty, if I may observe—foreign alliances are typically most valuable when pursued from strength, not necessity. They amplify power; they rarely create it from nothing. The question might be: what would make Castile strong enough that Aragon or Portugal seek alliance with us, rather than us seeking it from them?\"\n\nA subtle but important reframing.\n\nWhat other questions do you have for your cabinet? Or do you wish to reveal more about your plans?"

But Alfonso V's wife wouldn't work (already married). Alfonso's sisters might exist but wouldn't put Juan in the succession unless their children inherited. The most realistic path would be if somehow Juan's children could inherit, but that would require Alfonso V and all his brothers to die without heirs - unlikely but theoretically possible.\n\n**Portugal:** Similar situation - he'd need to marry into the line of succession, but Duarte has male heirs, so it's very unlikely.\n\nThe cabinet members would know this and would give realistic assessments. Diego would be the expert here.\n\nDynastic Possibilities\n\nDiego Gómez de Sandoval pauses, clearly considering the question's implications. The other cabinet members lean in slightly—this is a bold question that reveals strategic ambition.\n\n\"Your Majesty, that is... a far-reaching question.\" Diego moves back to the map, his mind clearly working through lineages. \"Let me address each crown separately.\"\n\nThe Crown of Aragon\n\n\"King Alfonso V is thirty-four and married to Maria of Castile—your own sister, Your Majesty, though the marriage is... not fruitful so far. No children after several years.\"\n\nÍñigo López de Mendoza adds quietly:\n\n\"There are whispers at court that the marriage is unconsummated or at least unsuccessful. Alfonso spends most of his time in Italy. The Queen remains in Aragon.\"\n\nDiego continues:\n\n\"If Alfonso were to die without legitimate heirs, the succession would pass to his brothers—the Infantes Juan and Enrique. Juan is already King of Navarre through his marriage to Blanca. Enrique is unmarried.\"\n\nHe pauses, calculating:\n\n\"For you to inherit Aragon through marriage... you would need to marry someone in the direct line of succession. Alfonso has sisters, but they're not in the direct line—their children wouldn't inherit ahead of Alfonso's brothers unless all the brothers died without heirs.\"\n\nLope de Barrientos interjects with canonical knowledge:\n\n\"The Church would need to approve any such marriage carefully. Marrying into the Aragonese royal family given your existing blood ties would require dispensations for consanguinity. Possible, but Rome would scrutinize it.\"\n\nDiego delivers the assessment:\n\n\"Realistically, Your Majesty? Inheriting Aragon through marriage is extremely unlikely. You'd need Alfonso and all his brothers to die without legitimate male heirs, and you or your sons to have married into the line. Possible in theory over generations, but not a practical short-term strategy.\"\n\nHe pauses, then adds carefully:\n\n\"Though if you had sons who married Aragonese princesses, and if the Aragonese succession failed... your grandchildren might unite the crowns. Dynastic politics works over generations, not years.\"\n\nThe Crown of Portugal\n\n\"King João I is seventy-three. His heir, Duarte, is in his late thirties and already has children—including sons. The Portuguese succession is secure for at least two generations.\"\n\nDiego shakes his head:\n\n\"Inheriting Portugal through marriage is even less likely than Aragon, Your Majesty. Duarte has legitimate male heirs. You'd need catastrophic dynastic failure—plague, warfare, multiple deaths—for the succession to become vulnerable.\"\n\n\"You could marry a Portuguese princess, certainly. That would create alliance and potential future claims for your children if Portuguese succession failed. But expecting to personally inherit Portugal? No, that's not realistic.\"\n\nThe Broader Picture\n\nÍñigo López de Mendoza speaks up, his poet's mind seeing patterns:\n\n\"Your Majesty, if I may... personal unions of crowns are generational projects. Ferdinand and Isabella might unite Castile and Aragon someday if the right marriages and successions align. But it takes time, patience, and usually requires multiple dynastic accidents.\"\n\nJuan de Daza, the practical administrator:\n\n\"And Your Majesty, even if you could inherit another crown, consider the complications. Aragon has its own Cortes, its own laws, its own nobility. Portugal fiercely guards its independence. A personal union might give you titles, but could you actually govern multiple kingdoms effectively?\"\n\nRodrigo Manrique adds bluntly:\n\n\"You can barely control the nobles here in Castile, Your Majesty—no offense meant. Adding Aragonese or Portuguese nobility to manage? That's not strength, that's asking for rebellions in multiple kingdoms.\"\n\nÁlvaro de Luna finally speaks, his voice measured:\n\n\"Your Majesty asks the right questions, but perhaps for the wrong reasons. Dynastic inheritance is about legacy and future generations. It's not a solution to present challenges.\"\n\nHe steps forward slightly:\n\n\"If you want to strengthen Castile's position relative to Aragon or Portugal, the path is not through inheriting their crowns. It's through making Castile strong enough that they must respect us, alliance or no alliance.\"\n\nDiego Gómez de Sandoval summarizes:\n\n\"To answer directly, Your Majesty:\n\nAragon: Theoretically possible if catastrophic succession failure occurs, but highly unlikely in your lifetime. A marriage alliance might position your descendants for eventual union, but that's generations away.\n\nPortugal: Even more unlikely. Their succession is secure. Marriage creates alliance, not inheritance prospects.\n\nPractical conclusion: Dynastic marriages are valuable for alliances, dowries, and long-term positioning. But if you're thinking about inheriting foreign crowns as a solution to current problems... that's not realistic strategy.\"\n\nHe pauses, then adds carefully:\n\n\"Unless, Your Majesty, you're thinking much longer term? Building a legacy over decades? In which case, yes—the right marriages now could position your children or grandchildren to unite Iberian crowns eventually.\"\n\nThe cabinet is watching you carefully. You've asked about inheritance, which suggests either very long-term thinking or perhaps misunderstanding how dynastic politics works. They're trying to determine which.\n\nLope de Barrientos ventures:\n\n\"Your Majesty, the greatest kings think in generations. But they also address the challenges of today. Perhaps the question is: what marriages or alliances serve both immediate stability and long-term dynastic prospects?\"\n\nHow do you respond? Are you thinking long-term dynasty building, or were you hoping for a quicker solution?"

          "text": "- Alfonso V of Aragon is about 34, married to Maria of Castile (Juan II's sister), no children\n- His younger brothers are the Infantes Juan and Enrique\n- Juan is King of Navarre through marriage to Blanca\n- Enrique is unmarried\n\nThe user is asking specifically about whether Juan (the married one) has children. This is an important detail I should provide. Let me think about the historical context.\n\nHistorically, Juan II of Aragon (the Infante Juan in our story) did have children, including Ferdinand II who would later marry Isabella and unite the crowns. But we're in 1430, so I need to figure out what the situation would be at this time.\n\nJuan married Blanca of Navarre in 1420, so by 1430 they could have children. Historically, their son Carlos (Charles, Prince of Viana) was born in 1421, so he'd be about 9 years old in 1430. They had other children too.\n\nSo yes, Infante Juan would have children by 1430, which means the Aragonese succession through him is actually reasonably secure. This is an important detail that affects Juan II of Castile's strategic calculations.\n\nLet me have Diego provide this information clearly.\n\nThe Aragonese Succession\n\nDiego Gómez de Sandoval nods, understanding your focus:\n\n\"Exactly right, Your Majesty. Let me clarify the complete picture.\"\n\nHe counts on his fingers:\n\n\"Infante Juan de Aragón—the elder of the two brothers you met today—is King of Navarre through his marriage to Blanca of Navarre. They married in 1420, so ten years ago.\"\n\nHe pauses significantly:\n\n\"And yes, they have children. A son, Carlos—he'd be about nine years old now. Born in 1421. There may be other children as well; I'd need to confirm the complete details, but the crucial point is: Infante Juan has a legitimate male heir.\"\n\nÍñigo López de Mendoza adds:\n\n\"Young Carlos is being raised in Navarre. He's the Prince of Viana—that's his title as heir to Navarre. Reportedly a serious, studious boy.\"\n\nDiego continues:\n\n\"So the Aragonese succession, if Alfonso dies without heirs, would be:\n\nFirst: Infante Juan becomes King of Aragon (while remaining King of Navarre)\nSecond: Upon Juan's death, his son Carlos inherits\nThird: Only if both Juan's and Enrique's lines fail completely would the succession become uncertain\"\n\nHe looks at you directly:\n\n\"Your Majesty, this means the Aragonese succession is actually quite secure. Alfonso has two younger brothers. One of those brothers already has a son. For you to inherit Aragon through marriage, you would need:\n\nAlfonso to die without heirs\n\nJuan to die without legitimate heirs (but he already has Carlos)\n\nEnrique to die without heirs\n\nCarlos to die without heirs\n\nAnd you'd need to have married into the line somehow\n\nThat's... a lot of deaths, Your Majesty. And frankly, some would look suspicious.\"\n\nRodrigo Manrique grunts:\n\n\"And even if all those men dropped dead tomorrow—which they won't—Aragon would likely choose one of their own nobles over a Castilian king. They're proud. They'd find some cousin with Aragonese blood rather than accept Castilian rule.\"\n\nLope de Barrientos adds soberly:\n\n\"There's also the matter that the Church frowns upon... convenient dynastic deaths. If heirs started dying suspiciously and you benefited, Rome would investigate. Poisoning rumors destroyed Pope Alexander VI's reputation. You don't want that shadow over your reign.\"\n\nJuan de Daza speaks practically:\n\n\"Your Majesty, I think what you're really asking is: 'Can I use the Aragonese succession as leverage?' And the answer is... perhaps, but not through inheritance.\"\n\nHe leans forward:\n\n\"Here's a different angle: Infante Juan has a son who will inherit Navarre and potentially Aragon. That boy is nine years old. In ten years, he'll be making his own alliances and marriage decisions. Your relationship with the Infantes now might position you to influence that boy's future choices.\"\n\nDiego nods thoughtfully:\n\n\"Or consider this: you have no heir yet, Your Majesty. Neither does Alfonso. You're both young. If you married and had children, and Alfonso remained childless, there might be future discussions about uniting the crowns through your children's generation—with Aragonese consent, not through conquest or forced inheritance.\"\n\nÁlvaro de Luna speaks from his position, his voice carrying a warning:\n\n\"Your Majesty, I must counsel caution in this line of thinking. The Infantes are here, in Castile, now, with armies and noble support. Speculating about inheriting their potential future kingdoms while they're actively maneuvering against you is... dangerous.\"\n\nHe pauses:\n\n\"They would view any such discussion as proof you see them as obstacles to be removed rather than relatives to work with. If word spread that you were calculating their deaths and succession rights... well, that's how civil wars start.\"\n\nCaptain Fernán shifts by the door, his soldier's instinct clearly agreeing with Álvaro's warning.\n\nDiego Gómez de Sandoval concludes:\n\n\"To summarize, Your Majesty:\n\nThe Reality: Aragonese succession is secure through Infante Juan and his son Carlos. You cannot realistically expect to inherit Aragon.\n\nThe Opportunity: Long-term dynastic positioning—your children might marry into Aragonese or Portuguese lines, creating future union possibilities.\n\nThe Danger: If you're seen as viewing the Infantes' deaths as beneficial to you, that poisons all relations and might even make them move against you preemptively.\n\nThe Recommendation: Think generationally about dynasty, but focus practically on securing your own throne first.\"\n\nHe looks at you carefully:\n\n\"Your Majesty, may I ask what prompted this line of inquiry? Are you thinking about marriage alliances generally, or is there a specific strategic concern we should address?\"\n\nThe cabinet is clearly trying to understand your thinking. Are you looking for long-term dynastic strategy, or were you hoping to find some leverage against the Infantes through succession politics?\n\nWhat do you tell them?"

          "text": "Historical context:\n- Juan II was actually married to Maria of Aragon (his cousin) in 1418, but since we've adjusted his age and the scenario, we're treating him as unmarried\n- Marriage alliances in this period were crucial for diplomacy\n- Options would include: Portuguese princesses, French princesses, English princesses, Italian nobility, German princesses, other Iberian nobility\n\nLet me have the cabinet discuss this realistically, considering:\n1. Diplomatic advantages\n2. Dowry/financial aspects\n3. Factional implications domestically\n4. Religious considerations\n5. Age and fertility considerations\n\nThe cabinet should provide various perspectives based on their expertise.\n\nMarriage Prospects for a Young King\n\nThe cabinet members relax slightly at your clarification. The tension that arose from discussing inheritance and deaths eases.\n\nDiego Gómez de Sandoval nods approvingly:\n\n\"A wise question, Your Majesty. Marriage is perhaps the most important political decision a king makes—it affects succession, alliances, domestic politics, everything.\" He settles into analysis mode:\n\nIberian Options\n\n\"Portuguese Alliance\"\n\n\"As we discussed, Portugal is stable and outside Castilian factional politics. King João I's son Duarte has daughters who will be of marriageable age soon, or there are other Portuguese noblewomen.\"\n\nAdvantages:\n\n\"Clean\" alliance without domestic complications\n\nWealthy trading partner\n\nPotential cooperation on African/Moorish matters\n\nThe Portuguese royal house is respected and legitimate\n\nDoesn't strengthen any Castilian faction\n\nDisadvantages:\n\nPortugal is small—doesn't dramatically shift power balance\n\nPortuguese are fiercely independent; won't intervene in Castilian politics\n\nLimited military support for your domestic challenges\n\nDiego continues: \"This would be a safe choice. Respectable, uncontroversial, diplomatically sound. But it doesn't solve immediate problems.\"\n\n\"Aragonese Alliance\"\n\n\"King Alfonso's sisters or other Aragonese noblewomen. Given that your own sister Maria is married to Alfonso, another Aragonese connection might strengthen ties.\"\n\nAdvantages:\n\nBlood ties formalized\n\nPotential to influence Aragonese policy\n\nMight moderate the Infantes' behavior if you're family in both directions\n\nDisadvantages:\nJuan de Daza interjects: \"Your Majesty, forgive my bluntness, but marrying into the Aragonese royal family right now would be seen as capitulation to the Infantes. Every noble in Castile would interpret it as you becoming their creature.\"\n\nDiego nods reluctantly: \"He's right. The timing is terrible. An Aragonese marriage would need to happen from a position of strength, not during their current maneuvering.\"\n\n\"Navarrese Alliance\"\n\n\"Navarre is small but strategic, sitting between Castile, Aragon, and France. Though currently ruled by Infante Juan through marriage...\"\n\nRodrigo Manrique interrupts: \"That's a non-starter. Juan is King of Navarre. Marrying into Navarre now just tangles you further with the Infantes.\"\n\nForeign Options\n\nÍñigo López de Mendoza speaks up, his cosmopolitan knowledge showing:\n\n\"Your Majesty, you could look beyond Iberia. European royal houses are always interested in Spanish alliances.\"\n\n\"French Alliance\"\n\n\"King Charles VII of France is fighting the English in the Hundred Years' War. He has daughters, relatives, noble houses.\"\n\nAdvantages:\n\nFrance is powerful\n\nBrings prestige and potential military support\n\nTraditional Castilian-French friendship against England\n\nFrench culture is prestigious at court\n\nDisadvantages:\nLope de Barrientos adds: \"France is currently losing to England—or was until recently with this peasant girl Joan leading their armies. Their situation is unstable. Also, a French marriage might alarm Aragon, which has Italian and Mediterranean interests that conflict with France.\"\n\nDiego: \"And French princesses come with French advisors, French factions, French influence at your court. Are you prepared for that?\"\n\n\"English Alliance\"\n\n\"King Henry VI of England—though he's only eight years old. But there are English noble houses, or waiting until a suitable match emerges.\"\n\nAdvantages:\n\nEngland is wealthy from wool trade\n\nMilitary prowess (currently winning in France)\n\nPrestigious alliance\n\nDisadvantages:\nJuan de Daza: \"England is far away and focused on France. They won't help with Granada or domestic politics. And wool trade might benefit England more than Castile.\"\n\nRodrigo: \"And English nobles would expect military adventures. They'd push for wars that benefit England, not Castile.\"\n\n\"Italian Alliance\"\n\n\"A princess from Milan, Florence, Venice, or Naples. King Alfonso of Aragon wants Naples—there are connections there.\"\n\nAdvantages:\n\nWealthy Italian city-states\n\nBanking connections (useful for financing campaigns)\n\nCultural prestige\n\nMediterranean trade benefits\n\nDisadvantages:\nDiego: \"Italian politics are byzantine—forgive the term. You'd be buying into feuds between city-states, papal politics, and Alfonso's ambitions. Complex and potentially costly.\"\n\n\"German/Imperial Alliance\"\n\n\"The Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund is elderly, but there are German princesses, Habsburg connections, other imperial houses.\"\n\nAdvantages:\n\nImperial prestige\n\nPotential papal influence (Emperor has sway in Rome)\n\nGerman wealth and resources\n\nDisadvantages:\nLope: \"The Empire is fractured—hundreds of princes and free cities, all squabbling. An Imperial alliance means little in practice. And German nobles would be completely lost in Castilian politics.\"\n\nDomestic Considerations\n\nJuan de Daza raises his hand:\n\n\"Your Majesty, may I address something everyone is dancing around?\" He waits for your nod. \"Any marriage you make will be interpreted domestically through the lens of your struggle with the nobility.\"\n\n\"If you marry foreign, the Castilian nobles will complain you're bringing in outsiders and foreign influence. They'll demand that her household be staffed by Castilians—meaning their clients and spies.\"\n\n\"If you marry Castilian nobility—say, a daughter from Mendoza, Velasco, or another great house—you dramatically strengthen that family and alarm all the others. The Infantes would see it as choosing sides.\"\n\nDiego Gómez de Sandoval adds:\n\n\"The traditional solution is to marry foreign but not too foreign. Close enough to be relevant, far enough to not bring overwhelming external influence. Portugal fits this perfectly—Iberian, Catholic, understood by Castilian nobles, but Portuguese enough to be neutral in our politics.\"\n\nPersonal Considerations\n\nLope de Barrientos speaks gently:\n\n\"Your Majesty, there's also the matter of... personal compatibility. You will have to live with this woman, produce heirs with her, perhaps even trust her. A political marriage need not be loveless, but it should at least not be miserable.\"\n\nHe continues carefully:\n\n\"A young bride can be educated to Castilian ways and attached to you personally. An older, politically experienced princess might have her own agenda. Youth suggests fertility for heirs but also malleability. Age suggests immediate diplomatic maturity but potential conflict.\"\n\nÍñigo López de Mendoza adds with a poet's sensibility:\n\n\"And Your Majesty, you are young—only eighteen. You have time. Rushing into marriage now, while facing political challenges, means your bride and her family become immediate targets or assets in ongoing struggles. Waiting even a year or two until your position strengthens might allow you to negotiate from better terms.\"\n\nÁlvaro de Luna's Assessment\n\nYour Constable finally speaks from his position:\n\n\"Your Majesty, marriage is the second most important decision you'll make—after how you handle the nobility. The two are connected.\"\n\n\"My counsel: don't marry until you've secured your position domestically. Every potential bride's family will assess your strength before agreeing to terms. Marry from weakness, and you'll pay dearly in concessions—her family will demand positions, influence, guarantees.\"\n\n\"But marry from strength—after you've established yourself—and you can negotiate as an equal. Your bride brings alliance and resources, but you're not dependent on them.\"\n\nHe pauses:\n\n\"That said, if you see a specific strategic opportunity—a marriage that actively strengthens your position against the Infantes—that might be worth considering sooner.\"\n\nSummary\n\nDiego Gómez de Sandoval provides the conclusion:\n\n\"Your Majesty, my recommendation based on current circumstances:\n\nBest immediate option: Portuguese princess—safe, respectable, neutral in domestic politics, creates useful alliance without complications.\n\nBest long-term option: Wait 1-2 years until your position strengthens, then reassess. French, English, or even Aragonese options become more attractive when negotiating from strength.\n\nAvoid now: Aragonese (looks like capitulation to Infantes), Castilian nobility (creates immediate factional problems), anything too exotic that brings unpredictable complications.\n\nWildcard: If a truly exceptional opportunity emerges—a princess who brings massive dowry, crucial alliance, and political advantage—consider it. But don't force it.\"\n\nHe looks at you directly:\n\n\"The honest answer, Your Majesty? You don't need to marry right now. You need to secure your throne. Marriage can wait six months, a year, even two years. You're eighteen—you have time. Use it wisely.\"\n\nThe cabinet waits for your reaction. They've laid out options but are essentially counseling patience—secure your position first, then marry from strength.\n\nDo you have thoughts on their assessment? Or other questions for your cabinet?"

They've just been recruited, and now they're learning their king is about to leave on pilgrimage with a regency council (presumably including the Infantes) in place. This would be alarming to them.\n\nI should show their reactions - surprise, concern, questions about:\n- What is this regency council?\n- Who is on it?\n- How long will he be gone?\n- What authority does it have?\n- What happened at the Medina del Campo meeting?\n- Are they in danger from the Infantes while he's gone?\n- Can they work with Álvaro?\n- Why is he going on pilgrimage now of all times?\n\nThis is a big reveal and should be treated as such. The cabinet would need to process this information and ask clarifying questions.\n\nThe Pilgrimage Revealed\n\nThe room goes very still.\n\nDiego Gómez de Sandoval is the first to react, his nobleman's composure cracking slightly:\n\n\"Your Majesty... a regency council? And you're leaving on pilgrimage?\" He exchanges glances with the others. \"This... this is what was decided at Medina del Campo today?\"\n\nJuan de Daza leans forward, his administrator's mind immediately grasping implications:\n\n\"Your Majesty, forgive me, but—you've just formed this cabinet, and now you're announcing you'll be absent? For how long? Who sits on this regency council?\"\n\nRodrigo Manrique speaks bluntly, his scarred face showing concern:\n\n\"The Infantes. They're on this council, aren't they? Your Majesty, you just asked me about Granada and borders, and now you tell me you're leaving while giving the Infantes formal authority?\" He doesn't quite raise his voice, but the alarm is clear.\n\nÍñigo López de Mendoza stands, his courtly polish slipping:\n\n\"Your Majesty, my family—the Mendozas—are we represented on this council? Or will we be subject to decisions made by...\" he pauses carefully, \"...others?\"\n\nLope de Barrientos asks the theological question:\n\n\"A pilgrimage, Your Majesty? Where? For what purpose? How long?\" His scholarly mind is working. \"Santiago de Compostela is traditional, but that's perhaps a month round trip. Are you going further?\"\n\nÁlvaro de Luna remains silent, watching you carefully. He knows the plan, but the cabinet doesn't, and their concern is mounting rapidly.\n\nCaptain Fernán has moved slightly closer to you, his soldier's instinct responding to the sudden tension in the room.\n\nJuan de Daza speaks again, his voice controlled but urgent:\n\n\"Your Majesty, you ask if we can serve each other and Don Álvaro while you're gone. But we need to understand the situation we're being asked to navigate.\" He counts on his fingers:\n\n\"One: You're forming a regency council—who has what authority?\nTwo: You're going on pilgrimage—for how long and where?\nThree: You're leaving Don Álvaro in charge—but under what constraints?\nFour: We've just been recruited—are we known to this regency council? Are we targets? Are we protected?\"\n\nDiego Gómez de Sandoval adds firmly but respectfully:\n\n\"Your Majesty, we accepted positions in your cabinet. We pledged to serve you. But you're now telling us that within days, you'll be absent, and we'll be serving Don Álvaro under the supervision of a regency council that—I assume—includes the very Infantes you've been maneuvering against.\"\n\nHe spreads his hands:\n\n\"We need to understand what we've truly agreed to. What is the actual situation?\"\n\nRodrigo Manrique is more direct:\n\n\"Your Majesty, are you running away? Or is this some strategy I'm not seeing? Because from here, it looks like you've just negotiated your own irrelevance and are fleeing before it gets worse.\"\n\nThe veteran's bluntness is shocking, but there's genuine concern rather than disrespect in his voice.\n\nÍñigo López de Mendoza says quietly:\n\n\"Or perhaps His Majesty is being very clever, and we simply don't yet understand the full plan.\" He looks at you. \"Your Majesty, if you expect us to serve effectively in your absence, we need to know what we're serving. What is the true purpose of this pilgrimage? What did you actually agree to with the Infantes? And what do you expect to achieve?\"\n\nAll five men are watching you intently. Álvaro remains still, clearly leaving this to you—it's your decision whether to reveal the full strategy or keep them partially in the dark.\n\nThe cabinet is concerned, confused, and slightly alarmed. They've just committed to you, and now you're announcing you'll be absent under circumstances that sound dangerous. They want—need—to understand what's really happening.\n\nHow much do you tell them? Do you reveal:\n\nThe full Rome plan and crusade strategy?\n\nJust the basic facts about the regency council?\n\nSomething in between?\n\nDo you explain your reasoning, or keep them on a need-to-know basis?"

It's been his dream to go on pilgrimage\n2. Strategic purpose: present as devout, test waters for crusade, confer with clergy\n3. No immediate crusade plan, but gathering information\n4. Regency council structure: Infante Juan, Infante Enrique, Archbishop of Toledo, Íñigo López de Mendoza\n5.

The men settle back, though concern doesn't entirely leave their faces.\n\nLope de Barrientos nods slowly, his scholar's mind working:\n\n\"A pilgrimage to gauge Church support for potential crusade... that makes theological and political sense, Your Majesty. Santiago de Compostela? Or further—perhaps visiting multiple shrines, multiple bishops, multiple monasteries?\" He's clearly trying to map your route and timeline.\n\nDiego Gómez de Sandoval absorbs the regency council structure:\n\n\"Infante Juan, Infante Enrique, the Archbishop of Toledo, and Íñigo López de Mendoza the elder—your family's Marquis de Santillana.\" He glances at the younger Íñigo in the room. \"That's... actually balanced, Your Majesty. Two Aragonese princes, one churchman, one powerful but cautiously loyal Castilian noble. They'll check each other.\"\n\nJuan de Daza is already calculating:\n\n\"Expenditures over 200,000 maravedís require approval. That's... significant but workable. Most routine administration falls below that threshold. Don Álvaro can maintain basic functions.\" He pauses. \"Though any major initiative would need council approval. They've effectively given themselves veto power over ambition.\"\n\nRodrigo Manrique grunts, still wary:\n\n\"Military deployments over 1,000 men. That means the Infantes must approve any significant military action. They can't easily stage a coup—you've given them legal authority instead, which satisfies their ambition without immediate violence.\" He nods grudgingly. \"Clever, if it holds. You've bought time.\"\n\nÍñigo López de Mendoza (the younger) looks thoughtful:\n\n\"My uncle—the Marquis—on the council. That's... good for my family's position, but it also means I must be careful. If I'm seen as your man while he sits on the regency council, that creates... complexity.\" He meets your eyes. \"I can manage it, but I'll need to be discreet in how I report and serve.\"\n\nDiego Gómez de Sandoval asks the practical question:\n\n\"Your Majesty, how long do you expect this pilgrimage to last? A month? Two? More?\"\n\nLope de Barrientos adds:\n\n\"And where specifically? Different shrines, different bishops—each tells us something about what information you're gathering and who you're cultivating relationships with.\"\n\nJuan de Daza focuses on his domain:\n\n\"During your absence, Your Majesty, you want us to serve Don Álvaro. What specifically should we be doing? Continue intelligence gathering as assigned? Report to Don Álvaro? And...\" he hesitates, \"...do the regency council members know we exist? Are we official, or are we... discreet?\"\n\nRodrigo Manrique is more direct:\n\n\"Your Majesty, you're testing Church support for crusade and presenting yourself as devout. Good. But four to six months away—and it will be that long if you're visiting multiple shrines and bishops—that's time for the Infantes to consolidate. What's our role in preventing that? What can we actually do with you gone?\"\n\nÁlvaro de Luna finally speaks, his voice measured:\n\n\"Gentlemen, His Majesty has made a calculated decision. He's given the Infantes formal authority to prevent them from seizing informal control. He's going on pilgrimage that serves genuine piety and strategic information-gathering. And he's built this cabinet to provide intelligence and support during his absence.\"\n\nHe looks at each of them:\n\n\"Your role is simple: continue gathering information in your assigned areas. Report to me. Help me understand what the nobility, the Church, the common people, the military, and the treasury are actually doing—not what they claim to be doing. The regency council will handle grand decisions. We handle reality.\"\n\nHe pauses:\n\n\"And no, you are not officially announced. You are the King's personal advisors, assembled quietly. The regency council may learn of you eventually, but they don't control you. You serve His Majesty, through me in his absence.\"\n\nDiego Gómez de Sandoval asks carefully:\n\n\"Don Álvaro, what happens if the regency council objects to our existence? If they demand we be dismissed or replaced with their own appointees?\"\n\nÁlvaro's eyes are hard:\n\n\"They may object. But His Majesty appointed you before leaving. You are established fact. And the regency council's authority covers major military, financial, and diplomatic decisions—not the King's right to have personal advisors.\" A slight pause. \"Though we should be prepared for them to test that boundary.\"\n\nLope de Barrientos ventures:\n\n\"Your Majesty, may I suggest something? If your pilgrimage includes visiting multiple bishops and discussing crusade prospects, I could provide introductions, letters of recommendation. The Dominican network is extensive. Knowing which bishops are sympathetic, which are political, which are genuine—that information could make your journey more productive.\"\n\nJuan de Daza adds:\n\n\"And Your Majesty, if you're gone for months, Don Álvaro will need accurate financial information to work within the 200,000 maravedí threshold. I can ensure he has daily updates on treasury status, so decisions don't accidentally trigger regency council review.\"\n\nRodrigo Manrique:\n\n\"If you're discussing crusade with military orders and frontier commanders, I can tell you who actually knows warfare and who's a political appointee. Save you from wasting time on fools who talk well but fight poorly.\"\n\nThey're beginning to see their roles. Not grand political maneuvering—that's locked down by the regency council—but intelligence, information, and support for Álvaro's administration.\n\nÍñigo López de Mendoza says quietly:\n\n\"Your Majesty, one concern. The Royal Council meeting in November, in Seville—six months hence. That's after you return from pilgrimage?\" At your confirmation, he continues: \"So the sequence is: you leave, the Infantes govern through regency council for months, then you return and immediately convene a grand council where permanent structures are debated?\"\n\nHe looks thoughtful:\n\n\"They'll use those months to build support for their vision of governance. Cultivate allies, distribute favors, demonstrate effectiveness. When the Royal Council convenes, they'll arrive with momentum and support. You'll need to return with something equally compelling to counter their position.\"\n\nHis eyes meet yours:\n\n\"That's why the pilgrimage isn't just piety, is it? You're building your own legitimacy and support—religious authority, crusade possibility, whatever you learn from bishops and clergy. You'll return with spiritual authority to counter their temporal authority.\"\n\nHe's close to grasping the full plan, even without knowing about Rome.\n\nHow do you respond? Do you:\n\nConfirm you'll be visiting Santiago and perhaps other Spanish shrines?\n\nReveal the Rome destination?\n\nKeep the specifics vague?\n\nAddress their concerns about serving during your absence?\n\nGive them specific instructions for what to do while you're gone?"

Candles flicker before a simple but beautiful crucifix. The evening light streams through stained glass windows depicting saints of Castile. The scent of incense lingers faintly.\n\nFray Hernando de Talavera waits by the altar, and your first impression is of intensity.\n\nHe's thirty-two, but his face has the weathered quality of someone who's lived austerely. His Hieronymite robes are clean but worn—not shabby, but clearly belonging to a man who takes his vow of poverty seriously. Dark hair tonsured in the monastic style, deep-set eyes that seem to look through surfaces to something deeper. His hands are calloused—he's done manual labor, not just scholarly work.\n\nWhen he sees you enter, he drops to his knees immediately, head bowed:\n\n\"Your Majesty.\" His voice is surprisingly deep, with the accent of someone from humble origins—Talavera, a town of no particular distinction. \"I am unworthy of this honor. To serve as confessor to the Lord's anointed...\" He trails off, seemingly overwhelmed.\n\nCaptain Fernán takes position outside the chapel door, closing it to give you privacy.\n\nFray Hernando rises slowly, and you see something in his bearing—genuine humility, but also fierce conviction. This is a man who takes his faith with absolute seriousness.\n\n\"Your Majesty, I... forgive me, I have never confessed royalty before. I confess farmers, artisans, my brother monks. I do not know the courtly forms, the proper protocols.\" He meets your eyes, and there's no dissembling there. \"But I know sin, and I know God's mercy. If Your Majesty will accept a simple priest's service, I am yours to command.\"\n\nHe gestures to the confessional—a traditional wooden booth with screens for anonymity, though in private royal confession, such formality is often dispensed with.\n\n\"Shall we proceed in the traditional manner, Your Majesty? Or...\" he seems uncertain about protocol, \"...how does Your Majesty wish to conduct confession?\"\n\nThere's something refreshing about his complete lack of courtly polish. He's genuine, perhaps to a fault. You can see why Álvaro suggested him—this man has no political connections, no agenda beyond serving God. But you can also see the challenge: he will take his role as spiritual advisor seriously. He won't play games with your soul.\n\nHow do you wish to proceed with your first confession with Fray Hernando? Do you:\n\nUse the traditional confessional format?\n\nSpeak to him directly, face to face?\n\nWhat do you confess—and what do you carefully omit?\n\nHow do you establish your relationship with this man who will accompany you to Rome?"

The humble uncertainty vanishes, replaced by something far more formidable:\n\n\"Your Majesty.\" His voice is firm, carrying the weight of centuries of Church doctrine. \"The seal of confession is absolute and inviolable. It is not merely my word—it is sacred law, established by Holy Mother Church and enforced under pain of excommunication.\"\n\nHe steps closer, his intense eyes fixed on yours:\n\n\"If the Holy Inquisition itself demanded I reveal what you tell me in confession, I would refuse. If they tortured me, I would die before speaking. If they threatened my life, my family, my brothers in faith—still I would remain silent.\" His voice drops but loses none of its intensity. \"The seal of confession is not a courtesy, Your Majesty. It is a sacred trust between penitent, priest, and God alone.\"\n\nHe pauses, and his expression shifts slightly—concern mixing with resolve:\n\n\"That Your Majesty feels the need to ask suggests what you will tell me carries great weight. Perhaps great danger.\" He meets your eyes directly. \"I understand. Men have been murdered for secrets before. Kings have been betrayed by those they trusted.\"\n\nHis hand moves unconsciously to the wooden cross hanging from his rope belt:\n\n\"But know this: I am a simple monk. I own nothing but these robes and my faith. I have no family to threaten, no wealth to seize, no ambitions to leverage. If someone wishes to torture or kill me for what you say in confession, they will find only silence.\" A slight, grim smile. \"The Hieronymites have produced martyrs before. We can do so again if God wills it.\"\n\nHe kneels before you, his voice taking on the formal cadence of an oath:\n\n\"Before God, before His Son Jesus Christ, before the Virgin Mary and all the saints, I swear: whatever Your Majesty confesses to me shall remain between us and God alone. No power on earth, no threat, no inducement, no command shall break that seal. I would die first.\"\n\nHe looks up, and there's steel in those deep-set eyes:\n\n\"You have my word, Your Majesty. But more than that—you have God's law protecting you. The seal is not mine to break, even if I wished to. It belongs to the Church, to Christ Himself.\"\n\nHe rises slowly:\n\n\"Now... shall we begin? And Your Majesty,\" he adds quietly, \"whatever burden you carry, whatever secret weighs upon your soul—confession is meant to lighten that burden, not increase it. Trust in God's mercy. Trust in the seal. And speak freely.\"\n\nHe gestures toward the confessional, or toward the simple chairs near the altar if you prefer face-to-face confession.\n\nThe chapel feels very quiet, very safe. This man will not betray you—not from fear of consequences, but from absolute conviction in his sacred duty.\n\nHow do you proceed? What do you tell Fray Hernando in this first confession?"

But it's also clearly sincere - Juan isn't just manipulating his confessor, he's expressing real spiritual struggle.\n\nFray Hernando's Response\n\nThere's a long silence from the other side of the screen. When Fray Hernando finally speaks, his voice carries deep emotion - not judgment, but something like recognition:\n\n\"Your Majesty...\" He pauses, corrects himself to the proper form: \"My son, what you describe is not sin. It is the burden of kingship.\"\n\nYou hear him shift in the confessional, leaning closer to the screen:\n\n\"You speak of God's kingdom on earth. Of wanting purity. Of being sickened by the corruption around you.\" His voice strengthens. \"Do you know what I hear? I hear a young king who has not yet had his soul corrupted by power. I hear someone who still sees the rot, who still feels revulsion at it. That is grace, my son. That is the Holy Spirit preserving your conscience.\"\n\nHe takes a breath:\n\n\"King David - the Lord's anointed, a man after God's own heart - had to make alliances with his enemies. He had to navigate the politics of Saul's court. He had to dance, as you say, with men who wanted him dead. And yet God loved David, because David's heart remained pure even when his actions had to be... strategic.\"\n\nA pause, then more gently:\n\n\"You say you feel tainted. Tell me - when you play this game, when you negotiate with proud nobles and make compromises, what is in your heart? Do you do it for your own glory? For your own power? Or do you do it because you see no other way to eventually build something good?\"\n\nThrough the screen, you can see his silhouette - he's leaning forward intently, waiting for your answer.\n\n\"The difference between a righteous king and a corrupt one is not whether they engage in politics - they must. The difference is why. A corrupt king plays the game to aggrandize himself. A righteous king plays it as a necessary evil, a means to an eventual good end, and he hates that he must do so.\"\n\nHis voice drops, becoming almost intimate:\n\n\"Your Majesty - my son - you describe feeling sick at having to be an accomplice in the nobles' farce. Do you know what that tells me? That your soul is still healthy. The day you stop feeling sick, the day you start enjoying the manipulation and deception - that is when you should worry. But now? Your conscience still works. Your heart still yearns for purity.\"\n\nAnother pause, then:\n\n\"Jesus Christ himself had to navigate the politics of the Pharisees, the Sadducees, the Roman occupation. He spoke in parables specifically because direct truth would have gotten him killed before his mission was complete. He was strategic. He was careful. And yet he was sinless.\"\n\nYou hear him settle back slightly:\n\n\"Now, let me ask you this, and answer honestly: when you engage in these political games, these deceptions with the nobles - have you done so with cruelty? Have you destroyed innocent people? Have you lied under oath before God? Have you broken sacred vows? Or have you simply... been wise as serpents while trying to remain innocent as doves?\"\n\nHis question hangs in the air. He's trying to determine whether your political maneuvering has crossed into actual sin, or whether it's simply the necessary prudence of a king trying to survive in a corrupt environment.\n\n\"Tell me, my son - in your dealings with these nobles, with the Infantes, with all who surround you - have you committed specific sins? Actual transgressions against God's law? Or do you confess a feeling, a spiritual burden, rather than concrete wrongdoing?\"\n\nHow do you respond? Do you:\n\nAdmit to specific deceptions (the performance at Medina del Campo)?\n\nConfess your plan to \"manage confessions\" regarding Rome?\n\nClaim only the burden of feeling tainted, not specific sins?\n\nReveal more about your actual intentions and plans?"

          "text": "That last question is particularly interesting. Why would Juan ask this? A few possibilities:\n- He's testing whether Fray Hernando would believe a claim of divine vision\n- He's genuinely asking because he's had some kind of spiritual experience\n- He's laying groundwork to potentially claim divine inspiration for the crusade\n- He's thinking about Joan of Arc and her visions (she's active right now in France)\n- He's considering how to present his pilgrimage/crusade plans in spiritual terms\n\nThis is a clever young king probing to understand how religious authority works. Fray Hernando would be cautious here - false claims of divine visions are serious business, but genuine spiritual experiences are also real in medieval Catholic theology.\n\nFray Hernando should:\n1. Address the deception issue first\n2. Then carefully address the question about visions\n3. Be both theologically sound and pastorally sensitive\n4. Perhaps probe gently about why Juan is asking\n\nThis is a delicate moment where Juan might be testing how much he can use religious language for political ends, or genuinely exploring his own spiritual experiences.\n\nThe Question of Visions\n\nFray Hernando is quiet for a long moment. When he speaks, his voice is thoughtful:\n\n\"First, let me address your deceptions. That you do not fully trust even your advisors - this is prudence, not sin. A king must guard certain knowledge. Discretion is wisdom.\" He pauses. \"But tell me - in these deceptions, do you claim falsehoods as divine truth? Do you swear lies in God's name? Do you use the sacraments as tools of manipulation?\"\n\nHe waits for your response, then continues:\n\n\"If not, then you walk a narrow path - but it is a path that righteous kings have walked before. Keep your conscience sharp. The moment deception becomes comfortable rather than necessary, examine yourself.\"\n\nAnother pause, then his tone shifts - becomes more careful, more probing:\n\n\"Now... your question about visions and divine communication.\" There's a weight to how he says this. \"My son, this is not an idle theological question, is it? Why do you ask?\"\n\nThrough the screen, you sense him leaning closer:\n\n\"I will answer you honestly, because you deserve truth. But first, understand: this is dangerous territory. False claims of divine vision are grave sin - they use God's name to deceive. The Church investigates such claims carefully, sometimes harshly. Joan of Valois claims visions even now in France, and the theologians debate whether she speaks for God or deludes herself or worse.\"\n\nHe takes a breath:\n\n\"That said - divine communication takes many forms. The theologians distinguish between several types:\n\nMiraculous visions - what you describe. Burning bushes, thunderclaps, angels appearing in glory. These are rare, reserved for prophets and saints. Most Christians never experience them. When they do occur, they are unmistakable, overwhelming, often witnessed by others.\n\nIntellectual illumination - this is more common among the faithful. You pray, you struggle with a problem, and suddenly clarity comes. Not a voice, not a vision, but a profound knowing. The answer feels placed in your mind by something beyond yourself. Saint Thomas Aquinas experienced this often.\n\nConsolation and conviction - the Holy Spirit working through prayer. You pray earnestly, and you feel peace about a particular course of action. Or you feel deep unease about another. Not dramatic, but persistent and clear.\n\nProphetic insight - rare, but documented. A sudden understanding of future events or hidden truths that proves accurate. This can be divine, but could also be natural intuition or even diabolic deception. Very difficult to discern.\"\n\nHe pauses significantly:\n\n\"The Church teaches that we must test such experiences. Saint Paul says 'test the spirits.' Saint Ignatius teaches discernment of spirits. How do we know if something comes from God, from our own mind, or from darker sources?\"\n\nHis voice becomes almost pedagogical:\n\n\"Signs it may be from God:\n\nIt leads toward humility, charity, and obedience to Church teaching\n\nIt brings peace, even if the path is difficult\n\nIt aligns with Scripture and doctrine\n\nIt serves others' good, not just your own ambition\n\nIt remains consistent over time, growing stronger in prayer\n\nIt bears good fruit in your life and others'\n\nSigns it may be false:\n\nIt puffs up pride - 'God chose me specially'\n\nIt contradicts Church teaching\n\nIt serves primarily your own interests\n\nIt brings agitation rather than peace\n\nIt changes frequently or disappears under scrutiny\n\nIt isolates you from spiritual counsel\"\n\nThere's a long pause, then very gently:\n\n\"My son... have you experienced something you believe might be divine communication? Is that why you ask?\"\n\nHis voice carries no judgment, only pastoral concern and sharp curiosity.\n\n\"If you have, you should tell me. Not because I doubt you, but because you need spiritual discernment. If God truly speaks to you, that is a great gift - but also a great burden. You would need guidance to understand it properly, to avoid self-deception or manipulation by others.\"\n\nThrough the screen, you sense him waiting - this humble monk who just explained that he would recognize the difference between genuine divine inspiration and political manipulation disguised as piety.\n\n\"Why do you ask about visions, Your Majesty? What prompts this question in the middle of your confession?\"\n\nHow do you respond? Do you:\n\nClaim you've had some kind of spiritual experience?\n\nSay you're just curious about Joan of Arc's visions?\n\nAdmit you're trying to understand how to legitimize your crusade plans?\n\nDeflect the question?\n\nTell him something closer to the truth about your strategic thinking?"

He's being somewhat honest - he does seem genuinely pious, and is mixing real devotion with political strategy\n5.

When Fray Hernando finally speaks, his voice is careful, measured:\n\n\"My son... what you describe is not miraculous vision. But it may be something more valuable - spiritual sensitivity. The ability to see beyond surface appearances to the deeper reality of grace and sin.\"\n\nHe shifts in the confessional:\n\n\"Many people walk through life blind to these glimpses you describe. They see a mother and child, but not the love of God reflected there. They see death and only feel horror, not the beauty of a soul returning home. That you notice these things, that you feel them deeply - this suggests a contemplative soul, one attuned to spiritual realities.\"\n\nA pause, then more cautiously:\n\n\"But I must ask you difficult questions now, because this is precisely where self-deception enters. Where our own desires become confused with God's will.\"\n\nHis voice becomes firmer, more probing:\n\n\"You say you feel a 'pull' toward Santiago, but also toward Rome. A terrifying thought, you say, because you'd be leaving your kingdom for some time.\" He lets that hang in the air. \"My son, let me be direct: why Rome specifically? Santiago de Compostela is one of Christendom's holiest sites. It would fulfill any pilgrimage vow, demonstrate piety, and take perhaps a month. Rome would take four to six months, possibly more.\"\n\nThrough the screen, you sense his intense focus:\n\n\"When you feel this 'pull' toward Rome - what accompanies it? Is it peace? Or is it also... ambition? Calculation? The knowledge that a personal audience with the Holy Father might accomplish certain political goals?\"\n\nThe question is not accusatory, but genuinely probing.\n\n\"I ask because the human heart is complex. We can experience both genuine spiritual calling and worldly calculation at the same time. Sometimes they intertwine so thoroughly we cannot separate them ourselves. Saint Ignatius teaches this - that we must examine not just what we desire, but why we desire it.\"\n\nHe leans closer to the screen:\n\n\"Tell me honestly - and remember, this is confession, between you, me, and God alone - when you think of going to Rome, what do you hope to find there? What do you hope to accomplish?\"\n\nA pause, then more gently:\n\n\"I am not accusing you of false piety. I believe your devotion is genuine. I see it in how you speak, in your anguish at the corruption around you. But genuine devotion can still become entangled with political necessity. The question is: are you going to Rome primarily to seek God's will? Or are you going to seek the Pope's support for something you've already decided to do?\"\n\nHis voice softens further:\n\n\"There is no shame in the latter, understand. Kings must think politically. A pilgrimage can serve both spiritual and temporal purposes - David's journey to the Tabernacle served his kingship even as it served his faith. But you must be honest with yourself about your motivations, or you risk using God's name to baptize your own ambitions.\"\n\nThrough the screen, you hear him take a breath:\n\n\"So I ask again: Why Rome? What specifically do you believe God is calling you to seek there? And...\" a significant pause, \"...what would you seek from the Holy Father if you went?\"\n\nHe's given you an opening - he's not dismissing your spiritual experience, but he's also not letting you hide political calculation behind mystical language. He wants the truth, or at least as much truth as you're willing to give in the confessional.\n\n\"And understand, my son - if you tell me you're going to Rome to seek a crusade bull, to gain papal legitimacy for your rule, to position yourself against rivals - that is not necessarily sin. Kings must do such things. The question is whether you're being honest about it, especially with yourself.\"\n\nHis voice drops to almost a whisper:\n\n\"The gravest danger is not that you mix piety with politics. It's that you deceive yourself into thinking political calculation is divine calling. That way lies madness - or worse, becoming like those corrupt nobles you despise, using God's name to justify ambition while telling yourself it's holy.\"\n\nHe waits for your response, and you can sense both challenge and compassion in his silence.\n\nHow do you respond? Do you:\n\nAdmit the political calculations openly?\n\nMaintain that it's primarily spiritual calling?\n\nTry to explain how the two are genuinely intertwined for you?\n\nDeflect or keep some cards close?\n\nAsk him directly if he would support the Rome journey?"

Pastoral and supportive, not just judgmental\n\nGiven Juan's honesty and the genuine mix of spiritual and political motivations, Fray Hernando would likely:\n- Acknowledge the honesty\n- Offer to help with discernment through prayer\n- Perhaps probe a bit more about whether Juan has truly considered all consequences\n- Maybe ask about the specific nature of the \"feeling\" that it's right\n\nI should keep this SHORT per the user's feedback. Just one or two brief responses, then a question.\n\nFray Hernando's Counsel\n\n\"Fear can be wisdom, my son. Or it can be the Holy Spirit warning you.\" A pause. \"When you say you 'feel' this is right - describe that feeling. Is it peace? Conviction? Or is it more like... determination? Resolve?\"\n\nHe waits for your answer."

Banners of Castile and León hang from the vaulted ceiling alongside the standards of the great houses. Candles burn in iron stands despite the morning light streaming through high windows. The air smells of incense, beeswax, and the nervous sweat of gathered nobles.\n\nPerhaps sixty witnesses have assembled - a carefully curated audience:\n\nThe great nobles: Representatives from Mendoza, Velasco, Estúñiga, and other major houses. They stand in small clusters, watching everything with calculating eyes.\n\nChurch hierarchy: Bishops and abbots, their rich vestments making them unmistakable. They murmur among themselves.\n\nCity representatives: From Valladolid, Burgos, Toledo, Seville. Merchants and town officials in fine but practical clothing.\n\nThe Infantes' faction: Perhaps a dozen nobles who've aligned themselves clearly with Juan and Enrique. They look almost triumphant.\n\nAt the center of it all, a raised dais has been prepared with five chairs. Four are arranged in a semi-circle facing the assembled witnesses. The fifth - the throne - sits slightly elevated and centered.\n\nThe Ceremony Begins\n\nÁlvaro de Luna stands to one side of the dais, his constable's chain of office gleaming. His face is perfectly composed, showing nothing. Captain Fernán and the royal guard line the walls in their new equipment - an impressive display.\n\nThe four council members stand before their chairs:\n\nInfante Juan de Aragón - dressed in rich but dignified clothing, every inch the senior prince. His expression is solemn, appropriate for the occasion.\n\nInfante Enrique de Aragón - martial bearing evident even in courtly dress. He looks less comfortable with ceremony than his brother.\n\nThe Archbishop of Toledo, Juan Martínez de Contreras - Age ~50, imposing in full episcopal regalia. His face is weathered, intelligent, politically astute. A powerful churchman who's navigated court politics for decades.\n\nÍñigo López de Mendoza, Marquis de Santillana - Age ~50, patriarch of the Mendoza family. Distinguished, cultured, wearing the understated elegance of old money and older nobility. He's watching you with particular intensity.\n\nYou enter from the private royal chambers. The assembly rises as one. You're dressed in full royal regalia - crown, scepter, robes of state. Every inch a king, despite your eighteen years.\n\nYou take your seat on the throne.\n\nThe room settles into expectant silence.\n\nWhat do you say to open this ceremony? How do you frame what's about to happen?"

I intend to take my time and travel where the lord takes me before returning home. Like I said, my journey is not known to me fully, but I do intend to visit Santiago along the way.\n\n\nIn order to secure the kingdom in my absence, I have seen fit to install a regency council to rule in my stead. Don Alvaro will rule in my stead and is assisted by a council that will provide oversight and provide guidance on important decisions. I am very grateful to the Mendoza family, the honoured archbishop and my cousins who have seen fit to accept the position on this council. The details of the council are written down in this document here and copies are to be distributed among you. In essence, it comes down to that I effectively let the council rule by three fourth majority temporarily. As soon as I return from my pilgrimage, the regency council is disbanded immediately.\n\n\nFinally, we will see each other again in half a year in Sevilla when I have seen fit to convene a council to assist me in facing the realm's challenges. Now, please join me in prayer for the realm and please pray for me when I am on my journey."

The Archbishop - a churchman would approve of pilgrimage on religious grounds, but might have concerns about the political implications.\n\n3. The Mendoza patriarch - his family is represented on the council, which is good for them, but he's probably assessing what this means for the balance of power.\n\n4. Other nobles - probably mixed reactions. Some might be alarmed that the Infantes are getting formal power. Others might see this as the king being weak.\n\n5. Álvaro de Luna - publicly he must show nothing, but this is a difficult moment for him.\n\nThe user also wants me to keep responses shorter and more conversational, stopping at natural interaction points. So I should describe the immediate reactions and then pause for the prayer or next action, not write a huge monologue.\n\nLet me write the immediate reactions to the announcement, then stop at the prayer moment.\n\nThe Announcement\n\nYour words echo through the great hall. The silence that follows is profound - everyone processing what they've just heard.\n\nInfante Juan steps forward first, dropping to one knee with practiced grace:\n\n\"Your Majesty honors us beyond measure. We accept this sacred trust and will guard your realm as our own.\" His voice carries throughout the hall. \"May God guide your pilgrimage and return you safely to us.\"\n\nInfante Enrique follows suit, kneeling beside his brother. More martial, less eloquent, but the gesture is clear.\n\nThe Archbishop of Toledo raises his hand in blessing:\n\n\"The Church rejoices that our young king seeks spiritual guidance through holy pilgrimage. We will pray daily for your safe journey and swift return.\" His eyes are sharp though - he's a political creature assessing implications.\n\nThe Marquis de Santillana - the elder Íñigo López de Mendoza - kneels last:\n\n\"The house of Mendoza is honored to serve Castile in this capacity. Your Majesty's trust will not be misplaced.\"\n\nThroughout the hall, reactions ripple:\n\nThe Infantes' faction looks pleased, even triumphant. Whispers of satisfaction.\n\nOther nobles show mixed expressions - concern, calculation, some looking alarmed.\n\nThe bishops seem genuinely approving of the pilgrimage announcement.\n\nCity representatives appear uncertain what this means for them.\n\nÁlvaro de Luna stands perfectly still, his face a mask. Only someone who knows him well would catch the tightness around his eyes.\n\nYou've called for prayer. The Archbishop steps forward:\n\n\"Shall I lead us in prayer for His Majesty's journey and the realm's protection, Your Majesty?\"\n\nWhat do you do?"

The assembly follows your lead - nobles, churchmen, merchants, soldiers - all kneeling. The great hall fills with the rustle of fabric and creak of joints.\n\nThe Archbishop's voice rises, formal and sonorous:\n\n\"Almighty and everlasting God, who hast set Thy servant Juan upon the throne of Castile and León, we beseech Thee to watch over him as he undertakes this holy pilgrimage.

Nobles NOT in the Infantes' faction who now see the Infantes with formal power\n2. Álvaro's known supporters who worry about his position\n3. Smaller nobles/cities who fear being squeezed out\n4. Perhaps some churchmen worried about secular power dynamics\n\nI should present a few different worried parties for Juan to approach, showing different types of concerns. Keep it conversational and dynamic.\n\nReading the Room\n\nAs you rise and begin moving through the assembly, the crowd parts respectfully. You can immediately identify several clusters of concern:\n\nNear the Western Wall\n\nPedro de Velasco, a count from the Velasco family (rivals to the Mendozas), stands with two other northern nobles. They're not openly hostile, but their body language is tense. When you approach, Velasco bows:\n\n\"Your Majesty.\" He hesitates, then speaks carefully. \"May I speak plainly?\"\n\nAt your nod:\n\n\"Six months is a long time. And a three-quarters majority on the council...\" He glances toward where the Infantes stand accepting congratulations. \"The two brothers vote together. They need only one more vote to control any decision. The Archbishop, or the Marquis.\"\n\nOne of his companions adds quietly:\n\n\"What happens to those of us not represented on the council, Your Majesty? Do we petition the Infantes for justice? For royal favor?\"\n\nThere's real anxiety here - nobles worried about being shut out of power.\n\nBy the Southern Columns\n\nRepresentatives from Seville and Córdoba - wealthy southern cities - are speaking in low, urgent tones. When you approach, they bow deeply.\n\nThe elder, a merchant named García Fernández, speaks:\n\n\"Your Majesty, the southern cities rejoice at your choice of Seville for the Royal Council. But...\" He looks uncomfortable. \"Forgive me, but who speaks for the cities during your absence? The regency council is princes, church, and high nobility. What of urban concerns? Trade disputes? Tax matters?\"\n\nHis companion from Córdoba adds:\n\n\"And Your Majesty, the frontier cities depend on royal justice between nobles and townsmen. Will the council hear our cases? Or will we be at the mercy of local lords for six months?\"\n\nThey're worried about being trampled by noble interests without royal protection.\n\nNear the Eastern Entrance\n\nJuan de Silva, a mid-ranking noble known to be in Álvaro's network of supporters, stands somewhat isolated. When you approach, he bows stiffly:\n\n\"Your Majesty performs his devotions, and we are honored.\" His tone is neutral but his eyes are worried. \"Don Álvaro serves brilliantly, but...\" He looks around to ensure he's not overheard. \"The constable has enemies who now sit on the council that oversees him. What protection does he have if they move against him? If they block his every decision?\"\n\nHe's essentially asking: have you just hung Álvaro out to dry?\n\nIn a Quiet Corner\n\nFray Lope de Barrientos, your new cabinet member, has positioned himself discreetly. When you catch his eye, he approaches and bows:\n\n\"Your Majesty.\" Very quietly: \"Several bishops are asking me privately about the nature of your pilgrimage. How long. Where exactly. Whether you carry papal correspondence.\" He pauses. \"Should I tell them you're simply following God's guidance? Or is there more they should know?\"\n\nHe's asking how much to reveal about your actual plans.\n\nWhich group do you wish to address first? Or do you speak to someone else entirely?"

Given his earlier strategic thinking, it's probably the latter - he can't show doubt publicly about the arrangement he just announced.\n\nJuan de Silva would likely be somewhat taken aback by this response, but as a subordinate noble, he can't really push back against the king's stated optimism.

Remote enough that you can disappear from there without witnesses.\"\n\nHe marks a spot on the map:\n\n\"Your hiding place - there's an abandoned shepherd's hut in the hills west of the city, perhaps an hour's ride. I can have supplies placed there discreetly. When the council convenes, I'll send a rider.\"\n\nHe looks up:\n\n\"Your father's sword is in the treasury vault.

He looks both excited and anxious.\n\nFour servants managing supplies and pack horses.\n\nA royal secretary to handle any correspondence.\n\nAbout thirty people total - enough to be properly royal, not so many as to be unwieldy.\n\nA small crowd has gathered to witness the departure. Nobles, palace officials, common folk from the city. Word spread quickly that the king departs on pilgrimage.\n\nÁlvaro de Luna stands at the palace steps. He bows formally:\n\n\"May God guide Your Majesty's journey and return you safely to your realm.\"\n\nHis eyes meet yours briefly - only you know what the next three days will truly hold.\n\nThe disguise is packed discreetly in your personal baggage.\n\nThe map to the hermitage of San Millán is memorized.\n\nThe shepherd's hut location is fixed in your mind.\n\nCaptain Fernán approaches:\n\n\"Your Majesty, we're ready.

The Infantes would need very good intelligence and quick reactions to have learned about this. But it's not \"High probability\" because there were some suspicious elements (the unusual prayer request, Fray Hernando's suspicions).\n\n**How aggressive will the Infantes be?**\n\nThis depends on several factors:\n- They believe Juan is truly gone (if the subterfuge worked)\n- This is their FIRST meeting - they want to establish precedent and momentum\n- But they're also politically sophisticated - they know going too far too fast could backfire\n\n- They have a strategic window of 6 months to carefully consolidate power\n- Their goal is to appear reasonable while subtly expanding their influence\n- They'll balance between seeming responsible and making calculated power moves\n\nI anticipate they'll likely choose a moderate approach - making a few strategic appointments and subtle restrictions, but avoiding any dramatic overreach that might provoke immediate backlash or intervention.\n\nThe messenger's report of prepared documents suggests they've thoughtfully planned their initial moves. Their confidence implies they're ready to test boundaries and establish new precedents, making a substantive power play quite probable.\n\nThe likelihood of success seems high, with their political sophistication guiding them to make meaningful yet not overtly aggressive changes during this critical first day of regency.\n\nProbability Assessment - The Subterfuge\n\nAction 1: Has your deception remained secret?\n\nAssessment: Likely to succeed\n\nFactors supporting success:\n\nExtremely tight circle of knowledge (only you, Álvaro, and the two guards know the full plan)\n\nThe two guards only learned the truth this morning - too late for leaks\n\nYour public departure looked completely legitimate to dozens of witnesses\n\n\"Divine inspiration\" explanation was consistent with your pious reputation\n\nShort timeline (only 3 days) limited opportunity for intelligence gathering\n\nRemote hiding location, pre-positioned supplies done discreetly\n\nThe Infantes left Valladolid believing you were departing\n\nFactors against success:\n\nFray Hernando suspects something beyond simple prayer - he's perceptive and knows you from confession\n\nCaptain Fernán was visibly troubled and might have expressed concerns to others\n\nThe request to stay alone at a remote hermitage was highly unusual\n\nThe Infantes have their own intelligence networks in Valladolid\n\nPalace servants gossip, and Álvaro's preparations (supplies to the hut) could have been noticed\n\nIf anyone in Álvaro's household is compromised, word could have reached the Infantes\n\nConclusion: Likely to succeed - Your preparations have been careful and the knowledge circle tight, but there were some suspicious elements that sharp observers might have noted.\n\nAction 2: Will the Infantes make significant moves in this first meeting?\n\nAssessment: Likely to succeed (that they WILL make meaningful moves)\n\nFactors suggesting they'll act boldly:\n\nThey believe you're truly gone for months - this is their window\n\nThe messenger reported they're \"eager and confident\" with \"prepared documents\"\n\nFirst meetings set precedent - they want to establish their authority immediately\n\nThey've waited years for this opportunity and have clear grievances against Álvaro\n\nInfante Juan is politically sophisticated and will want to move quickly while momentum favors them\n\nThey have 6 months ahead, but consolidating power early makes the rest easier\n\nFactors suggesting they'll be cautious:\n\nThey're politically experienced and know overreach can backfire\n\nThe regency agreement gives them time - no need to rush everything into one meeting\n\nThey want to appear reasonable and responsible to other nobles\n\nGoing too far too fast could unite opposition against them\n\nÁlvaro is present and will resist openly bad-faith moves\n\nConclusion: Likely to succeed - They will almost certainly make some significant moves (appointments, restrictions on Álvaro, establishing procedures that favor them), but probably won't attempt a complete power grab in one meeting. The \"prepared documents\" suggests substantive action planned.\n\nPlease roll for both actions and tell me the results:\n\nSubterfuge remaining secret: Great Success / Success / Failure / Catastrophic Failure\n\nInfantes making significant moves: Great Success / Success / Failure / Catastrophic Failure"

This is great for Juan because he'll catch them being extremely overreaching. Maybe they're not just making reasonable administrative moves, but actually trying to:\n- Remove or replace key Álvaro loyalists\n- Seize control of royal finances beyond what the agreement allows\n- Make appointments that should require Juan's approval\n- Perhaps even discussing how to prevent Juan's return or limit his power when he comes back\n- Maybe they're being overconfident because they think he's gone and are revealing their true intentions\n\nThe combination is interesting: they have SOME inkling something might be off (status quo on secrecy) but they're so eager and confident that they're proceeding with aggressive moves anyway.

The crown settles on your head - familiar weight, reminder of authority. You strap your father's sword to your belt, giving truth to the excuse you'll use.\n\nSergeant García checks your appearance:\n\n\"Every inch a king, Your Majesty.\"\n\nCorporal Rodrigo is already saddling the horses.\n\nYou wait perhaps another twenty minutes - letting the meeting get well underway - then mount up and ride.\n\nThe Palace - Approaching the Council Chamber\n\nYou enter through a side gate, your guards flanking you. Palace servants do double-takes - wasn't the King supposed to be gone? - but you move with such purpose they simply bow and scramble out of your way.\n\nAs you approach the council chamber, you hear raised voices. Álvaro's voice, sharp with barely controlled anger:\n\n\"—absolutely exceeds the council's authority! The agreement specified—\"\n\nInfante Juan's voice, smooth but firm:\n\n\"The agreement gives us oversight of major decisions. Replacing a compromised treasury official certainly qualifies.\"\n\nThe Archbishop's deeper tone:\n\n\"Gentlemen, perhaps we should document this properly before—\"\n\nYou're nearly at the door. The guards posted outside look shocked to see you. One starts to announce you, but you shake your head - you want to hear more first.\n\nInfante Enrique's voice, more aggressive:\n\n\"And the royal guard needs restructuring. Too many men loyal to the Constable personally rather than the crown. We should appoint—\"\n\nÁlvaro, cutting in:\n\n\"You mean loyal to the King. Or have you forgotten who actually rules Castile?\"\n\nA tense silence, then Infante Juan again:\n\n\"Which brings us to the final matter. The Marquis and I have discussed this.

That's a significant constitutional change. The other nobles would need to—\"\n\nInfante Enrique, bluntly:\n\n\"The other nobles will accept it if presented correctly. 'Ensuring stable governance,' 'preventing rash decisions,' 'protecting the realm from youthful impulse.' It's for Castile's good.\"\n\nInfante Juan again:\n\n\"Exactly.

The King is anointed by God. Permanent restrictions on his authority would require papal approval and—\"\n\nInfante Juan, smoothly:\n\n\"Which is why we don't call them 'restrictions.' We call it 'wise counsel that the King graciously accepts.' We formalize what already exists informally. And by November, with six months of successful governance under our direction, the assembled nobles will see the wisdom—\"\n\nA pause, then Infante Enrique:\n\n\"Brother, are we certain he won't return early? That business at the hermitage—Captain Fernán seemed troubled when he arrived in the city yesterday.\"\n\nInfante Juan, dismissively:\n\n\"Divine inspiration, the Captain said.

That seems a reasonable compromise - Daza continues his duties, the council receives the information they need for oversight.\"\n\nInfante Enrique looks frustrated but nods grudgingly:\n\n\"That would be... acceptable. If we receive the same financial information.\"\n\nHe's conceding the point. The attempt to remove Daza has failed.\n\nThe Archbishop looks relieved at the compromise:\n\n\"Then are we agreed?

Nothing requiring immediate council attention.\"\n\nThe Archbishop raises a hand:\n\n\"Your Majesty, there is one matter.

Not a long monologue.\n\nPrivate Conversation with Fray Hernando\n\nThe monk walks with you away from the firelight, into the darkness at the edge of camp. When he speaks, his voice is quiet but firm:\n\n\"Your Majesty, you told everyone back there that you used prayer and divine guidance as... a cover. For political maneuvering.\"\n\nHe turns to face you:\n\n\"I am glad you were honest with them about that. But Your Majesty, do you remember what we discussed in confession? About the danger of confusing your own will with God's voice?\"\n\nHis eyes are intense in the darkness:\n\n\"You deceived your companions, set a trap for your enemies, threatened a prince's life, then returned and admitted it was all calculation. Was any of it genuine? The prayer at the hermitage? The claim that God showed you the way?\"\n\nHe's not accusing - he's asking. Genuinely trying to understand where your soul stands.\n\n\"Because if you use prayer as theater, as political tool, you poison the well of your own faith. Eventually you won't be able to tell the difference anymore.\"\n\nHe waits for your answer.\n\nHow do you respond?"

But he's also a Hieronymite monk - a relatively new order (founded in 14th century) focused on contemplation, scholarship, and austere living. He would have a sophisticated understanding of prayer.\n\nFray Hernando's Answer\n\nThe monk is quiet for a moment, considering your question seriously:\n\n\"When I pray, Your Majesty... I seek to empty myself. To quiet my own thoughts, my own desires, my own cleverness.\" He looks up at the stars. \"Sometimes I succeed. More often I fail.\"\n\nHe turns back to you:\n\n\"My thoughts wander constantly. I think about the monastery accounts, about a passage of Scripture I'm struggling with, about whether I said something foolish to a brother monk. Sometimes I'm reciting prayers while mentally arguing with someone from three years ago.\"\n\nA slight, rueful smile:\n\n\"Prayer is hard work, Your Majesty. It's the struggle to distinguish between God's voice and the endless chatter of my own mind. Saint John of the Cross calls it 'the dark night' - when you cannot hear God at all, only yourself.\"\n\nHe steps closer:\n\n\"But when I do hear something beyond myself - it's not words. It's... clarity. Peace about a direction. Or profound unease about another. A knowing that doesn't come from reasoning.\"\n\nHe pauses:\n\n\"Is that what you experienced, Your Majesty? When you prayed at the hermitage and decided to return - was it calculation, or was it that deeper knowing?\"\n\nHe's asking you to be honest with yourself as much as with him.\n\nHow do you answer?"

I have never heard anything beyond myself like you have.\n\n\nI spent a good hour thinking about where I was, what I was about to do and how to do it. And how it would serve God. Then I got up and did it. I stayed behind because I needed an excuse to stay behind. I could also have said I needed to take an enourmous shit. Or that I needed to go hunting or anything else.

He doesn't separate his faith from his politics - they're intertwined\n\nFray Hernando needs to respond to this. He's a spiritual director trying to guide a young king who is both genuinely pious and politically calculating. This is exactly the kind of spiritual complexity that real confessors dealt with.\n\nHernando should:\n- Acknowledge the honesty\n- Recognize the genuine piety mixed with calculation\n- But also warn about the dangers\n- Not condemn, but guide\n- Show understanding but maintain his role as spiritual guardian\n\nKeep it concise - just Hernando's response, then ask what Juan does.\n\nFray Hernando's Response\n\nThe monk is silent for a long moment. When he speaks, his voice is thoughtful:\n\n\"Your Majesty, what you describe is... honest. Painfully honest.\" He pauses. \"Most powerful men lie to themselves. They dress ambition in holy robes and call it God's will. You at least see clearly what you're doing.\"\n\nHe looks at you directly:\n\n\"But Your Majesty, there's danger in what you describe.

We pray to align ourselves with God's will - not to use God as justification for our own plans.\"\n\nA pause:\n\n\"The glimpses of heaven you describe - the dying woman's peace, the children playing - those are real. God showing you what goodness looks like. But then you take those glimpses and say 'therefore I must scheme, manipulate, trap my enemies.' Do you see? The leap from vision to action may be your will, not His.\"\n\nHe steps closer:\n\n\"I believe your piety is genuine, Your Majesty. I believe you truly want God's kingdom. But wanting a holy end doesn't make every means holy. That path leads to the Inquisition - people who torture in God's name because they're certain their purpose is righteous.\"\n\nHe meets your eyes:\n\n\"Will you let me guide you? Not to stop you from acting, but to help you discern when you're serving God and when you're serving yourself while calling it God?\"\n\nHow do you respond?"

Keep it conversational and authentic to a humble but theologically informed monk.\n\nFray Hernando's Challenge\n\nFray Hernando considers this carefully:\n\n\"Your Majesty asks if converting Granada to Christendom is God's will. The answer is... yes, of course God desires all souls to come to Him. But now let me ask you questions:\"\n\nHe holds up a finger:\n\n\"Is it God's will that they convert through the sword? Through conquest and force? Or through genuine faith born of witnessing Christian virtue?\"\n\nA second finger:\n\n\"Is it God's will that you unite your fractious nobility under this banner primarily to save souls, or primarily to consolidate your power?\"\n\nA third:\n\n\"If you conquer Granada, will you truly bring them to Christ? Or will you create a population of false converts who resent their conquerors and practice Islam in secret?\"\n\nHe drops his hand:\n\n\"Your Majesty, the goal may be holy. But that doesn't mean every path to it serves God. Saint Augustine wrestled with this - can Christians wage just war? Perhaps. But Augustine also warned against using piety to dress up ambition.\"\n\nHe looks at you intently:\n\n\"So tell me honestly: if you could achieve a stable, unified Castile without crusade against Granada, would you still pursue the crusade?

Perhaps point out that if it's truly God's will, He can make the impossible possible\n5. Distinguish between \"this is hard so I won't try\" vs \"this is hard but I tried everything first\"\n\nThe monk should be realistic but not cynical. He understands the world but won't compromise on moral principles just because they're inconvenient.\n\nFray Hernando's Response\n\nFray Hernando doesn't flinch from the question:\n\n\"Remotely possible? Perhaps not. Granada has held for centuries. The Nasrid sultans show no signs of voluntary conversion. Peaceful missionary work has achieved... little.\"\n\nHe pauses:\n\n\"But Your Majesty, 'nearly impossible' is not the same as 'therefore violence is justified.' The question is: have you tried? Have you sent embassies offering genuine peace and religious dialogue? Have you supported missionaries? Have you demonstrated Christian virtue so compelling that even Muslims might be moved?\"\n\nHis voice is gentle but firm:\n\n\"Or do you skip directly to 'it's impossible, therefore crusade is the only way' because crusade also serves your political needs? That's my concern, Your Majesty. Not that you pursue crusade - but that you haven't first exhausted every peaceful alternative.\"\n\nHe spreads his hands:\n\n\"Christ could have called down legions of angels to force conversion. He didn't. He preached, He healed, He suffered. Most rejected Him anyway. Does that failure justify the Inquisition's tortures? Does difficulty justify shortcuts?\"\n\nA pause:\n\n\"If you tell me you've tried everything peaceful and failed, then perhaps just war doctrine applies.
