          "text": "1. This is a historical RPG set in 1430 Castile\n2. The player controls King Juan II (age 18)\n3. The game has progressed through 17 chapters already\n4. The current situation: Juan has recalled Fray Hernando and the qadi to travel to Rome to deliver letters and reports to the Pope\n5. Currently, two advisors (likely \"Met\" is a typo for someone, and Álvaro de Luna) are discussing travel companions and safe conduct guarantees\n\nI need to:\n1. Search the project knowledge to understand the current state of the story\n2. Find out who the key characters are\n3. Understand what happened in Chapter 17 (or the most recent chapter)\n4. Understand the context of why Hernando and the qadi are being sent to Rome\n5. Set the scene appropriately\n\nLet me search for the most recent chapter information and key details about the current situation.\n\nI'll search the project knowledge to understand the current state of affairs at the end of Chapter 17 and set up Chapter 18 properly.\n\nGood! I have information about Chapter 17. Let me search for more specific details about what's happening at the end of Chapter 17 or beginning of Chapter 18, particularly around the decision to send Hernando and the qadi to Rome.\n\nFrom what I've read:\n- At the end of Chapter 17, Juan has decided to send Fray Hernando and Ahmad al-Zarqali (the converted qadi) to Rome\n- They're carrying an official military report and a personal letter to Pope Martin V\n- The letters report the victory at Alcalá, the conversions, and position Juan as a perpetual crusader\n- Ahmad is living proof of the conversion success\n- Timeline is mid-April 1431\n\nNow I need to understand who \"Met\" is - this might be a typo. Let me search for more context about advisors and who might be discussing this with Álvaro.\n\nI don't see \"Met\" as a character. This must be a typo. Looking at the cabinet members and advisors, the most likely people who would be discussing this with Álvaro would be from the cabinet:\n- Juan de Daza (Treasury official)\n- Diego Gómez de Sandoval (Count of Castro, converso noble)\n- Lope de Barrientos (Dominican scholar)\n- Íñigo López de Mendoza (young Mendoza, poet)\n- Rodrigo Manrique (Frontier soldier)\n\nOr it could be someone else entirely. However, given the context of discussing travel companions and safe conduct for a diplomatic mission to Rome, this seems like it might be a strategic/political discussion. \n\nActually, wait - the user might have meant \"Mendoza\" and abbreviated it as \"Men\" which got autocorrected to \"Met\"? Or it could be someone else.\n\nI should just ask for clarification rather than guess. But actually, looking more carefully at the user's message, they say \"Met and Alvaro are discussing...\" - this suggests two people discussing together. Given the context, this is likely a cabinet member or advisor. I'll just refer to them generically as one of Juan's advisors and let the scene play out naturally, allowing the user to clarify if needed.\n\nLet me search for more information about the current situation at the end of Chapter 17.\n\nGood! Now I have a much better picture. Chapter 18 begins in mid-April 1431. The key facts:\n\n1. Juan has decided to send Fray Hernando and Ahmad al-Zarqali (the converted qadi) to Rome\n2. They're carrying an official military report and a personal letter to Pope Martin V\n3. Currently, advisors are discussing travel companions and guarantees of safe conduct\n4. Isabel is likely pregnant (conceived early March, it's now mid-April)\n5. The campaign is ongoing - Íllora under siege, Vélez-Málaga taken\n6. Guerrilla warfare is proving effective for Granada\n\nThe user says \"Met and Alvaro are discussing...\" - I think \"Met\" might be a typo. It could be:\n- Mendoza (Íñigo López de Mendoza)\n- Or possibly a reference I'm missing\n\nLet me just proceed with the scene, treating \"Met\" as one of Juan's advisors having a discussion with Álvaro about the travel arrangements. I'll set the scene naturally and let the user clarify if needed.\n\nSetting: Jaén Fortress, mid-April 1431. Juan has summoned the discussion about preparing Hernando and Ahmad's journey to Rome.\n\nChapter 18: The Road to Rome\n\nJaén Fortress, Mid-April 1431\n\nThe late afternoon sun slanted through the narrow windows of the council chamber, casting long shadows across the maps and documents spread upon the oaken table. The sounds of the military camp beyond the walls—hammering, shouted orders, the ring of steel on steel—formed a constant backdrop to the discussion within.\n\nDon Álvaro de Luna stood with one hand resting on the table, his dark eyes sharp as he considered the question at hand. Across from him, one of Juan's senior advisors leaned forward, frowning at the list of names they'd been compiling.\n\n\"The journey to Rome is no small matter,\" Álvaro said, his voice measured. \"Fray Hernando and the qadi—Ahmad—will be carrying documents that could shape the next decade of Christendom's understanding of this crusade. We cannot simply send them on the road like wandering friars.\"\n\nHe glanced toward where Juan sat at the head of the table, then continued: \"The converted qadi especially presents... complications. A Muslim scholar who chose baptism after witnessing our victory—Rome will be fascinated, certainly. But the journey itself? There are risks.\"\n\nThe other advisor nodded slowly. \"Through Aragon, then Provence, then into Italy. Four, perhaps five weeks of travel. We need men who can protect them, but also men who won't draw excessive attention. A large armed escort might suggest we fear for their safety—which could undermine the message that Ahmad chose conversion freely.\"\n\nÁlvaro's fingers drummed against the table. \"And then there's the question of credentials. Safe conduct from us is one thing. But through Aragonese territory? King Alfonso might view this embassy with... interest. Especially after the Infantes' failed revolt.\"\n\nHe paused, meeting Juan's gaze directly. \"Your Majesty, we need to consider several questions. First: who travels with them? Fray Hernando is respected, but he's a spiritual advisor, not a diplomat. Ahmad is... well, he's learned and speaks Latin, but he's newly Christian and unfamiliar with European politics. Do we send a secular companion? Someone with diplomatic experience?\"\n\n\"Second,\" he continued, ticking off on his fingers, \"what guarantees can we provide? Letters bearing your seal certainly. Cardinal Capranica's contacts would help—his network in Rome is extensive, and his associates could watch over them. But what about passage through Aragon? Do we approach King Alfonso directly for safe conduct, or do we rely on our existing diplomatic channels?\"\n\nThe other advisor interjected: \"And timing, Your Majesty. Pope Martin is elderly and unwell. If we delay too long...\" He left the implication hanging.\n\nÁlvaro nodded grimly. \"Yes. Every week we wait is a week the Holy Father might not have. Yet if we rush and something goes wrong—if Ahmad is attacked by bandits, or if Fray Hernando falls ill, or if they're detained at some border crossing—the entire purpose is defeated.\"\n\nHe gestured to the documents on the table. \"We have your official report of the victory at Alcalá—seventy conversions, the destruction of the Sultan's army, the fortresses taken. We have your personal letter pledging perpetual crusade service beyond Granada. These are powerful documents. They need to arrive intact, carried by credible witnesses who can testify to what they've seen.\"\n\n\"So the question before us, Your Majesty,\" Álvaro concluded, \"is how do we ensure that happens?\"\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the composition of the embassy and the arrangements for their protection?"

          "role": "gm",
          "text": "Juan is making sensible decisions here:\n1. Making it a formal diplomatic mission\n2. Small escort (3 guards) - not too large to draw attention, enough for basic protection\n3. A noble diplomat to handle any political issues\n4. Credentials and letter to the Pope's advisor (Cardinal Orsini, mentioned in Chapter 3)\n\nNow Álvaro needs to suggest candidates. Looking at the documents:\n- Need someone with diplomatic experience\n- Trusted by Juan\n- Not critical to the campaign\n- Has the rank/status to be credible in Rome\n- Ideally someone who might benefit from being away from Castile during the campaign\n\nFrom Chapter 1-2, the cabinet members included:\n- Juan de Daza (treasury official, commoner)\n- Diego Gómez de Sandoval, Count of Castro (converso noble)\n- Lope de Barrientos (Dominican scholar)\n- Íñigo López de Mendoza (young Mendoza, poet)\n- Rodrigo Manrique (frontier soldier - now commanding western army)\n\nOther nobles mentioned:\n- Various military commanders are committed to the campaign\n- The Infantes are integrated into command\n- Need someone not essential to military operations\n\nI should have Álvaro suggest 1-2 candidates with pros/cons, allowing Juan to make the choice. Perhaps:\n1. Someone from the original cabinet who isn't military-critical\n2. A younger noble who would benefit from the experience\n3. Maybe someone whose absence during the campaign might actually be politically useful\n\nLet me create a realistic conversation where Álvaro considers the options.\n\nÁlvaro's expression brightened slightly at the decisiveness of the response. \"Three guards—yes, that strikes the right balance. Enough to deter casual bandits, not so many as to look like we're sending Ahmad under armed escort.\" He paused, considering. \"We'll want steady men. Veterans who can handle themselves but also know when discretion is the better part of valor.\"\n\nHe moved to the window, looking out over the camp as he thought. \"As for the noble companion...\" He turned back, his fingers steepled. \"We need someone with sufficient rank to be taken seriously in Rome, but also someone whose absence won't cripple our campaign efforts here. And ideally, someone with at least some diplomatic experience—or the wit to navigate unfamiliar waters.\"\n\nÁlvaro began pacing slowly. \"I have two thoughts, Your Majesty. The first is Diego Gómez de Sandoval, Count of Castro.\" He glanced at Juan to gauge the reaction. \"From your cabinet—you'll remember him. Converso background, which actually might work in our favor here. He's observed court factions for you, so he understands politics. Intelligent, cautious, and his rank as Count gives him sufficient standing. He's not involved in military command, so his absence won't affect the campaign.\"\n\nHe held up a hand. \"The consideration there is his converso heritage. In Rome, that could be... interesting. Some might view it as poetic—a man from a family that converted from Judaism now escorting a Muslim convert to meet the Pope. Others might be less charitable. But Cardinal Capranica's network would likely protect him from any significant issues.\"\n\nÁlvaro resumed pacing. \"The second option is Íñigo López de Mendoza—the younger one, not his father the Marquis. Also from your cabinet, a poet and observer. House Mendoza carries enormous weight, and his family connections would open doors across Europe. He's cultured, speaks passable Latin, and has the education to engage with Rome's intellectual circles. At twenty-eight, he's young enough to benefit enormously from the experience, but old enough to be taken seriously.\"\n\nHe paused by the table, looking at the maps. \"The risk with young Íñigo is that he's... well, a poet and a thinker more than a man of action. If they encounter serious trouble, he might not respond as decisively as we'd hope. But for navigating the complexities of papal politics and presenting our case eloquently? He'd excel.\"\n\nÁlvaro met Juan's eyes. \"Both men are loyal. Both are competent. Sandoval is steadier and more worldly; Mendoza has better connections and more natural charm. Either could serve well.\"\n\nHe crossed his arms. \"There's also a third possibility I should mention, though it's less conventional. We could send Lope de Barrientos—the Dominican scholar from Salamanca, also in your cabinet. He's Church, not secular nobility, but that's not necessarily a disadvantage in Rome. He knows theology, he's brilliant, and he could engage with cardinals and church officials on their own terms. The complication is he's a Dominican, and Fray Hernando is already providing spiritual guidance. Two clergy might seem redundant.\"\n\nÁlvaro spread his hands. \"Those are my thoughts, Your Majesty. Sandoval for steady competence, Mendoza for connections and eloquence, or Barrientos if you want to emphasize the theological dimensions of the embassy. Any of them could succeed. The question is which qualities you value most for this mission.\"\n\nWho do you choose?"

          "text": "Juan has chosen Diego Gómez de Sandoval, the converso Count of Castro. This is an interesting choice - there's a certain poetry to it, having a converso escort a Muslim convert to Rome. Álvaro approved of this option, noting Diego's steadiness and worldly experience.\n\nThe practical arrangements:\n- Diego Gómez de Sandoval (noble diplomat)\n- Fray Hernando (spiritual advisor, witness)\n- Ahmad al-Zarqali (converted qadi, living testimony)\n- 3 guards (veterans, discreet)\n- Letters of safe conduct from Juan\n- Letter to Cardinal Orsini (Pope's advisor, from the earlier chapters)\n- Official report + personal letter to Pope Martin V\n\nJuan's advice about Ahmad not wearing Muslim icons is wise - they need to present him as a genuine convert, not someone clinging to his old faith.\n\nNow I need to stage the scene where Juan summons them before departure. This should be:\n1. A formal but intimate gathering\n2. Juan giving final instructions and blessing\n3. The weight of the mission made clear\n4. Each person's role defined\n5. The documents handed over\n6. Perhaps some personal moments\n\nLet me set this in Jaén, probably in Juan's private chamber or a small council room. The party would be: Fray Hernando, Ahmad, Diego Gómez de Sandoval, and the three guards. Álvaro might be present as well.\n\nI should make this feel significant - this embassy could shape how Rome views the crusade for decades. Pope Martin V is dying, so timing is critical.\n\nÁlvaro nodded with clear approval. \"An excellent choice, Your Majesty. Diego has the temperament for it—careful but not timid, observant without being paralyzed by complexity. And as I said, there's a certain... symmetry to it. A converso escorting a Muslim convert. Rome will notice that detail.\"\n\nHe made a note on the parchment before him. \"I'll have the letters of safe conduct prepared immediately—bearing your seal and stating their diplomatic status. We'll also include Cardinal Capranica's letter of introduction, which should smooth their path considerably once they reach Italy. And I'll draft instructions for Diego regarding the route and who to contact at key points along the way.\"\n\n\"As for the guards,\" Álvaro continued, \"I recommend three men from Captain Fernán's original company—veterans from your journey to Rome two years ago. They know the route, they've proven their loyalty, and they're experienced enough to avoid trouble rather than seek it.\"\n\nHe paused, then added more quietly: \"Your advice about Ahmad is wise. The conversion must appear genuine and complete—which it is, of course, but appearances matter in these things. Perhaps suggest he dress in modest Christian garb for the journey. Nothing ostentatious, but clearly not Muslim. When he arrives in Rome, let the cardinals see a man who has embraced Christ, not one clinging to his former life.\"\n\nTwo Days Later - Jaén Fortress, Private Chamber\n\nThe room was smaller than the grand council hall, more intimate. Late afternoon light filtered through a single window, illuminating the dust motes hanging in the still air. A table had been prepared with wine and bread—simple hospitality for a momentous occasion.\n\nJuan stood near the window as they assembled. Fray Hernando entered first, his gray Franciscan habit dusty from the camp, his weathered face showing the strain of recent weeks but also a quiet determination. Behind him came Ahmad al-Zarqali, dressed now in plain Christian garb—a simple tunic and cloak, no longer the elegant robes he'd worn as qadi. His beard was neatly trimmed, and he carried himself with the dignity of a scholar, though his eyes showed the uncertainty of a man about to walk into an unknown world.\n\nDiego Gómez de Sandoval, Count of Castro followed, a man of perhaps forty years with the careful, watchful eyes of someone who'd learned to read shifting political winds. His dress was appropriate for a diplomatic mission—fine but not ostentatious, marking him as a man of rank without unnecessary display.\n\nFinally came the three guards: weathered veterans in traveling gear, swords at their sides but no heavy armor. Men who could blend into the road traffic of Europe while still being capable of violence if needed.\n\nÁlvaro de Luna closed the door behind them and took a position by the wall, witnessing but not central to the moment.\n\nJuan gestured for them to approach the table. \"Please, all of you. Sit if you wish, or stand as you prefer. This isn't a formal court ceremony—it's a conversation between men about to undertake something of great importance.\"\n\nHe waited until they'd settled, then continued. \"You leave tomorrow at first light for Rome. The journey will take four to five weeks if the weather and roads cooperate. You carry with you documents that will shape how Christendom understands this crusade—not just this year, but for decades to come.\"\n\nJuan picked up a sealed leather case from the table. \"This contains three items. First, my official military report to His Holiness Pope Martin V. The victory at Alcalá, the conversions, the fortresses taken. The facts of what we've accomplished.\"\n\nHe set it down and picked up a smaller, more ornate case. \"Second, my personal letter to the Holy Father. Sealed separately, marked for his eyes only. In it, I've pledged myself to perpetual crusade service—not just completing the reconquista, but carrying the Church's banner wherever it's needed after Granada falls. To Africa, against the Ottomans, wherever Christ's cause requires champions.\"\n\nHis eyes moved to each of them in turn. \"These letters mean nothing without credible witnesses. That's why you travel together—not just as couriers, but as testimony itself.\"\n\nHe turned to Fray Hernando. \"Father, you've been with me since before Rome. You witnessed my audience with Pope Martin, you carried the True Cross into battle at Alcalá, you saw the Sultan's army broken and the conversions that followed. When you speak to the cardinals, you speak as one who was there. They'll believe you because you have no reason to lie and every reason to tell the truth carefully.\"\n\nFray Hernando bowed his head slightly. \"I will testify to what I have seen, Your Majesty. Nothing more, nothing less.\"\n\nJuan nodded, then looked at Ahmad. The former qadi met his gaze steadily, though there was nervousness there too.\n\n\"Ahmad,\" Juan said quietly, \"you are the living proof of what this crusade can achieve. A qadi who led morning prayers for the Sultan's victory, then chose baptism after witnessing God's judgment. When Rome sees you, hears your story, understands your journey—they'll know this is more than just warfare. It's transformation.\"\n\nHe paused, choosing his words carefully. \"But I'll be honest with you. The journey will be difficult in ways you may not expect. You'll travel through Christian lands where many have never met a converted Muslim. Some will be fascinated. Some will be suspicious. A few may be hostile, though Diego and the guards will protect you.\"\n\n\"My advice,\" Juan continued, \"is to present yourself as you are now—a Christian. Not a Muslim wearing a thin Christian veneer, but a man who has embraced the faith genuinely. The clothing you wear now is appropriate. Speak openly about your journey, your doubts, your reasons for choosing Christ. Don't hide your past, but don't cling to it either. When Rome meets you, let them see a man transformed, not a man divided.\"\n\nAhmad's voice was quiet but firm. \"I understand, Your Majesty. I... I am still learning what it means to be Christian. But I chose this path freely. That much I can testify to without any doubt.\"\n\n\"That's all anyone can ask,\" Juan said gently. Then he turned to Diego Gómez de Sandoval.\n\n\"Count Diego. You're the head of this embassy. Fray Hernando provides spiritual guidance, Ahmad provides living testimony, but you navigate the political waters. You make the decisions about routes, about when to speak and when to stay silent, about which doors to knock on and which to avoid.\"\n\nDiego inclined his head. \"I understand, Your Majesty. I've prepared as best I can—studied the route, memorized Álvaro's contacts, reviewed what we know of the current situation in Rome. But I'll be honest: much will depend on circumstances we can't predict.\"\n\n\"That's why I chose you,\" Juan replied. \"You have the judgment to adapt. A few things to remember: Pope Martin is elderly and ill. Time is critical—don't dawdle, but don't rush so much you attract suspicion or risk the documents. Cardinal Orsini is the Pope's closest advisor; present yourselves to him first. He knows me from my visit two years ago. Trust his guidance on how to approach the Holy Father.\"\n\nHe picked up another sealed letter. \"This is for Cardinal Orsini specifically, reminding him of our meeting and asking him to facilitate your audience. Cardinal Capranica's network will also help—Álvaro will give you the relevant names and locations.\"\n\nDiego accepted the letter with both hands. \"We'll treat these documents as we'd treat relics, Your Majesty. They'll reach Rome intact, or we won't reach Rome at all.\"\n\nJuan smiled faintly. \"I'd rather you reach Rome intact as well, Diego. Don't be reckless. These letters are important, but you're also valuable—all of you.\"\n\nHe turned to address all of them together. \"You have letters of safe conduct bearing my seal, declaring you to be on official diplomatic mission to the Holy See. In most circumstances, that should be sufficient. But if you encounter serious trouble—if someone powerful tries to detain you, if Aragonese authorities create difficulties—use your judgment. The mission is important, but your lives matter too.\"\n\nJuan paused, then added more quietly: \"One more thing. You're traveling through Aragon. King Alfonso... well, his brothers tried to rebel against me and failed. He may view this embassy with interest, or suspicion, or both. My advice is to be respectful if you encounter his officials, but don't volunteer more information than necessary. You're traveling to Rome on crusade business. That's true, and it's all they need to know.\"\n\nHe looked at each of them again. \"Do any of you have questions? Concerns? Now is the time to voice them.\"\n\nWhat does Juan's embassy say, if anything, before they depart?"

When he's asked a question or expected to react, I'll stop and wait for you to tell me what he says or does.\n\nThere's a moment of silence as the group absorbs Juan's words.\n\nFray Hernando speaks first, his voice measured. \"Your Majesty, one practical question. When we reach Rome and present ourselves to Cardinal Orsini—should we request a private audience with His Holiness, or would it be more appropriate to present our testimony before a gathering of cardinals? I ask because the conversions at Alcalá have theological implications that the Curia will want to examine.\"\n\nDiego Gómez de Sandoval adds, \"And related to that, Your Majesty—if Cardinal Orsini or others wish to question Ahmad extensively about his conversion, about Islamic theology, about his observations of the battle... do we have your authority to speak freely? Or are there matters we should avoid discussing?\"\n\nAhmad himself remains silent, though his hand unconsciously touches the simple wooden cross hanging at his neck—a gesture that seems to steady him.\n\nThe three guards stand quietly, awaiting orders. They appear to have no questions—veterans who understand their role requires no clarification."

And may He continue to guide your hand in this crusade.\" The old Franciscan's eyes are bright with emotion—he's leaving the king he's served since before the pilgrimage, venturing into uncertain waters.\n\nAhmad steps forward and, somewhat awkwardly, performs a formal bow—still learning Christian courtly manners. \"Your Majesty, I...\" He pauses, searching for words. \"Two months ago, I was qadi in Alcalá, serving the Sultan. Now I travel to meet the Pope as your ambassador. I do not fully understand how God brought me to this moment, but I will honor the trust you place in me.\"\n\nThe three guards clasp fists to hearts in the soldier's salute, silent but resolute.\n\nÁlvaro opens the door for them. As they file out into the corridor, the sound of their footsteps gradually fades. The Count of Castro's measured stride, Fray Hernando's shuffle in his worn sandals, Ahmad's careful steps, the veterans' practiced quiet—all moving toward whatever awaits them on the long road to Rome.\n\nThe Following Morning - Jaén, Eastern Walls\n\nThe embassy departed at first light, as planned. From the fortress walls, one could watch them until they disappeared into the olive groves heading northwest—five travelers on horseback, a packhorse carrying supplies and the precious sealed letters, becoming smaller and smaller until the morning mist swallowed them entirely.\n\nNow, mid-morning, Álvaro finds Juan in the war room. The camp beyond continues its organized chaos—thousands of troops drilling, supply wagons arriving, the constant activity of an army preparing for imminent deployment.\n\n\"They're away cleanly,\" Álvaro reports. \"No incidents, good weather for travel. With fortune, they'll reach Zaragoza in four days, then into Navarre and France beyond.\"\n\nHe sets down a new stack of dispatches on the table. \"But we have more immediate matters requiring your attention, Your Majesty. Three items, in order of urgency.\"\n\nHe picks up the first document. \"Master of Calatrava's latest report from the Íllora siege. He's... frustrated. The fortress is proving more difficult than anticipated. He's requesting additional siege equipment or permission to attempt an assault. His exact words were 'sitting here bleeding men to guerrilla raids while accomplishing nothing is poor use of fifteen thousand troops.'\"\n\nThe second dispatch. \"From Rodrigo at Vélez-Málaga. He's secured the port and asks for strategic direction—should he consolidate his position, or does he have permission to push toward another target? He notes the fleet is still in excellent condition and his men are eager.\"\n\nThe third document is a letter bearing an unfamiliar seal. \"This arrived yesterday from Granada. It's... unusual. A personal letter addressed to you from someone claiming to be a senior merchant in the Sultan's court. He requests safe passage to Jaén to discuss 'matters of mutual benefit.' Could be genuine, could be an intelligence probe, could be an assassination plot. But it's written in quite good Latin and shows detailed knowledge of our recent movements.\"\n\nÁlvaro sets the documents down and looks at Juan directly. \"Your Majesty, the campaign is reaching a decision point. Íllora is bleeding us slowly. Vélez-Málaga offers opportunities but needs direction. And this merchant letter... well, that requires your judgment on whether to even respond.\"\n\nHe spreads his hands. \"Which fire do you wish to address first?\""

          "text": "**Context:**\n- Pope Martin V is elderly (~72-73) and in poor health\n- Juan visited Rome in 1430, received the crusade bull personally\n- The Pope invested heavily in Juan - gave him True Cross fragment, Saint James bone, 20,000 florins, letters to monarchs\n- Juan promised to complete the Reconquista\n- Now Juan sends: official military report of crushing victory at Alcalá, 70+ conversions including a qadi, personal letter pledging perpetual crusade service beyond Granada\n- Ahmad al-Zarqali - converted qadi - traveling as living proof\n- Fray Hernando - witnessed everything, credible spiritual advisor\n- Diego Gómez de Sandoval - converso noble leading the embassy\n\n**Factors in Favor:**\n- Pope Martin personally blessed this crusade - has huge stake in its success\n- Crushing military victory validates his investment\n- Mass conversions are exactly what Rome wants to hear (spiritual victory, not just military)\n- Ahmad as living proof is powerful - a Muslim scholar choosing Christianity\n- Juan's personal letter pledging perpetual crusade is Pope's dream\n- Cardinal Orsini knows Juan from 1430 visit, can vouch for him\n- Cardinal Capranica's network supporting the embassy\n- Timing: This could be one of Martin V's last great triumphs before death\n- Juan delivered on his promise quickly (less than a year since campaign started)\n- The conversions validate the crusade theologically\n- Rome loves dramatic stories and Ahmad's journey is incredibly dramatic\n\n**Factors Against/Complications:**\n- Pope Martin is very ill - might be too sick for extensive audiences\n- Papal politics: cardinals positioning for next conclave, some might be skeptical\n- Ahmad is newly converted - some might question authenticity\n- Some cardinals might be jealous of Juan's success or skeptical of his ambitions\n- Church bureaucracy can be slow\n\n- Potential skepticism about Juan's ambitious \"perpetual crusade\" pledge\n- Political tensions with Aragonese-aligned cardinals\n- Uncertainty about the genuine nature of conversions\n\nI see potential challenges, but the overwhelming narrative is one of triumph. The unprecedented conversion of a prominent Muslim qadi and the decisive military victory create a compelling story that could reshape perceptions of the Reconquista. Ahmad's personal journey represents more than just a military conquest - it's a spiritual transformation that Rome will find irresistible.\n\nThe papal court will carefully analyze this development, recognizing its strategic and symbolic significance. Juan's commitment of perpetual service offers a politically astute gesture that could strengthen the church's position and momentum in the ongoing religious conflict.\n\nRome's Response to Juan's Embassy - D100 Table\n\nLet me evaluate the situation in Rome (late May/early June 1431):\n\nFactors Strongly in Favor:\n\nPope Martin V personally invested in this crusade (True Cross fragment, 20k florins, letters)\n\nCrushing victory at Alcalá validates his judgment\n\n70+ conversions including a qadi - exactly the spiritual victory Rome craves\n\nAhmad as living proof is unprecedented and dramatic\n\nJuan's pledge of perpetual crusade service is the Pope's dream\n\nCardinal Orsini knows Juan from 1430, can vouch for credibility\n\nThis could be Martin V's final great triumph (he's dying)\n\nValidates crusading ideology at crucial moment\n\nStory is compelling and will spread across Christendom\n\nFactors Against/Complicating:\n\nPope Martin very ill - may be too weak for extensive audiences\n\nCardinals positioning for conclave - some skeptical or politically opposed\n\nAhmad's conversion might be questioned (coerced vs genuine?)\n\nSome cardinals allied with Aragon might be wary after Infantes' rebellion\n\nChurch bureaucracy and politics could slow response\n\nJuan's \"perpetual crusade\" ambition might seem like youthful overreach to some\n\nDiego's converso background might create minor prejudice in some quarters\n\nRealistic Assessment: This is massive good news for a Pope who bet heavily on Juan. The victory, conversions, and Ahmad's presence are exactly what Rome wanted. Most likely outcome: enthusiastic reception with political complications around papal health and succession politics.\n\nD100 Table: Rome's Reception of the Embassy\n\n1-3: Catastrophic Failure\nPope Martin V dies before they arrive or immediately after. Embassy caught in conclave chaos. Letters acknowledged but lost in political turmoil. Ahmad questioned harshly, some cardinals openly skeptical of conversion authenticity. Embassy must navigate succession politics with no clear papal response.\n\n4-10: Poor Reception\nPope too ill to grant audience, or grants only brief formal meeting. Cardinals divided - some enthusiastic, others skeptical. Ahmad faces intense theological interrogation, some hostility. Questions raised about conversion authenticity. Bureaucratic delays. Response is acknowledgment but not enthusiastic endorsement. Takes weeks to get any formal reply.\n\n11-25: Mixed Reception\nPope Martin grants audience but is visibly very ill, can't engage deeply. Cardinals interested but divided. Ahmad examined extensively - some fascinated, some suspicious. Theological debates about forced vs. free conversion. Political factions complicate response. Eventually positive but muted acknowledgment. Some formal blessing but not the enthusiastic endorsement hoped for.\n\n26-50: Adequate Reception\nPope Martin receives them despite illness, clearly moved by news. Cardinals generally positive, though some political skepticism. Ahmad's testimony well-received by most, though subjected to thorough examination. Formal papal blessing and letters of commendation granted. Response is positive and validates Juan's efforts, though not overwhelming. Standard diplomatic success.\n\n51-75: Strong Positive Reception\nPope Martin deeply moved, grants substantial audience despite health. Calls it validation of his papal legacy. Cardinals largely enthusiastic - Ahmad's story captivates Rome. Theological examination of Ahmad goes well, most convinced of genuine conversion. Formal papal letter praising Juan's success and spiritual leadership. Rome begins spreading the story across Christendom. Clear endorsement and support.\n\n76-90: Exceptional Reception\nPope Martin grants multiple audiences, calls this one of his papacy's great triumphs. Cardinals enthusiastic - Ahmad becomes sensation in Rome. Artistic commissions already being discussed about the qadi's conversion. Papal letter not just praising but elevating Juan as model crusader king. Cardinal Orsini ensures maximum political support. Promises of additional resources/support. Rome actively promoting Juan's crusade across Europe.\n\n91-100: Triumph Beyond Expectations\nPope Martin, despite illness, treats this as capstone of his papacy. Public ceremony with Ahmad presenting testimony before assembled cardinals. Overwhelming enthusiasm - story spreads like wildfire through Rome and beyond. Pope writes extraordinary letter declaring Juan exemplar of Christian kingship and perpetual crusade champion. Cardinals compete to associate with success. Substantial additional financial/political support pledged. Ahmad offered position in Rome if desired (which he can decline). Juan's reputation in Rome elevated to legendary status. Some cardinals already speaking of Juan as potential leader of wider crusade against Ottomans after Granada falls.\n\nReady for you to roll."

This should be realistic - not over-the-top but genuinely positive and meaningful for Juan's position.\n\nKey elements to include:\n1. The audience with Pope Martin V\n2. Ahmad's reception and examination\n3. The cardinals' response\n4. What formal documents/letters they receive\n5. Political implications\n6. When they depart and what message they carry back\n\nThe user wants me to describe what MESSAGE or RESULTS the delegation leaves Rome with - so focus on what they're bringing back to Juan.\n\nI should NOT generate any dialogue or actions for Juan - this is just describing what happened in Rome and what the delegation returns with.\n\nRome - Late May to Mid-June 1431\n\nThe embassy's five weeks in Rome proved extraordinary, though not without complexity.\n\nThe Papal Audience\n\nPope Martin V, though visibly weakened by illness and age, received the embassy three days after their arrival. Cardinal Orsini facilitated the audience personally, and his presence signaled to the Curia that this was a matter of importance.\n\nThe meeting took place in a private chamber rather than formal audience hall—a concession to the Pope's frailty, but also creating intimacy that worked in the embassy's favor. Martin V sat propped by cushions, his breathing labored, but his mind remained sharp.\n\nFray Hernando presented the official military report first, describing the Battle of Alcalá in measured terms. The Pope listened intently, occasionally asking clarifying questions about tactics and casualties. When Hernando reached the account of the Sultan's army breaking and fleeing, Martin V's eyes brightened.\n\nThen came the conversions. The Pope leaned forward as Hernando described the seventy warriors choosing baptism, the qadi's theological crisis, the spontaneous professions of faith. \"Seventy souls,\" Martin V whispered. \"Seventy Muslims who saw God's judgment and chose truth.\"\n\nDiego presented Juan's personal letter—sealed, marked for the Pope's eyes only. Martin V broke the seal himself and read in silence, his weathered hands trembling slightly as he held the parchment. When he finished, he looked up with tears in his eyes.\n\n\"He pledges himself to perpetual crusade,\" the Pope said quietly to Cardinal Orsini. \"Not just Granada. Africa. The Ottomans. Wherever the Church needs champions. This... this is what we prayed for. A king who understands.\"\n\nThe audience lasted nearly two hours—far longer than the Pope's physicians recommended. He asked detailed questions about the campaign, the conversions, Juan's character and faith. Fray Hernando's testimony carried enormous weight; the Pope remembered him from Juan's 1430 visit and trusted his judgment.\n\nBefore dismissing them, Martin V spoke directly to the embassy: \"Tell your king that he has our complete confidence and blessing. Tell him that God's hand is clearly upon this crusade. Tell him that we will ensure all Christendom knows what he has accomplished.\"\n\nAhmad's Examination\n\nThe Curia's response to Ahmad al-Zarqali was fascination mixed with intense scrutiny.\n\nOver ten days, Ahmad was examined by various cardinals, theologians, and church scholars. They questioned him about Islamic theology, his reasons for conversion, whether he'd been coerced, his understanding of Christian doctrine, his intentions going forward.\n\nAhmad handled it remarkably well. He was honest about his doubts, his intellectual crisis after the battle, his genuine search for truth. He didn't claim perfect understanding of Christianity—only that he'd recognized Islam's answers were insufficient and chosen to seek truth in Christ. His scholarly background and evident sincerity convinced most questioners.\n\nSeveral cardinals became genuine advocates. Cardinal Domenico Capranica (who'd helped Juan in 1430) was particularly enthusiastic, seeing Ahmad as proof that crusade could achieve spiritual transformation rather than just military conquest. Others saw propaganda value—a converted qadi was a powerful symbol.\n\nThere were skeptics, certainly. A few cardinals questioned whether the conversion would last, whether Ahmad truly understood Christianity, whether he might revert to Islam once away from Christian authority. But even the skeptics acknowledged his testimony was compelling and his presence in Rome generated enormous interest.\n\nBy the second week, Ahmad had become something of a sensation. Scholars wanted to debate theology with him. Artists sketched him. Chroniclers interviewed him. The story of the qadi who led prayers for the Sultan's victory, then converted after witnessing God's judgment, spread through Rome like wildfire.\n\nThe Curia's Response\n\nCardinal Orsini orchestrated a broader presentation before an assembly of cardinals in the third week. Diego, Fray Hernando, and Ahmad all spoke. The response was overwhelmingly positive.\n\nSeveral factors worked in Juan's favor:\n\nPolitical Timing: With Pope Martin clearly dying, cardinals were thinking about legacy. Supporting a successful crusade made them look good and aligned them with what might be Martin V's final great accomplishment.\n\nThe Conversion Narrative: Ahmad's story provided exactly what Rome wanted—proof that crusade could save souls, not just conquer territory. It validated the entire crusading ideology at a moment when some questioned its relevance.\n\nJuan's Reputation: The cardinals remembered the 18-year-old king who'd stripped naked before the Pope and pledged everything to the crusade. That he'd actually delivered on his promises impressed them deeply.\n\nStrategic Implications: A successful reconquista would free Castilian military power for other crusades—potentially against North Africa or even supporting eastern campaigns against the Ottomans. Cardinals saw Juan as a long-term asset.\n\nNot everyone was enthusiastic. Cardinals with Aragonese connections were more reserved, conscious of the political complications between Juan and King Alfonso V. A few questioned whether Juan's ambitions were sustainable or represented youthful overreach. But the majority were clearly supportive.\n\nWhat the Embassy Brings Back\n\nAfter five weeks in Rome, the embassy departed in mid-June 1431 with substantial results:\n\n1. Formal Papal Letter (Public)\n\nA letter from Pope Martin V to King Juan II, written in the Pope's own hand despite his weakness, suitable for public circulation:\n\nThe letter praises Juan's victory at Alcalá in effusive terms, calling it \"a triumph not merely of arms but of faith.\" It commends the conversions as evidence of divine favor and describes Juan as \"a model of Christian kingship in an age that desperately needs such examples.\"\n\nCritically, it explicitly validates Juan's broader crusading ambitions: \"Just as you have shown yourself faithful in the reconquest of Iberia, so too do we trust you shall prove faithful in carrying Christ's banner wherever the Church has need—to Africa, against the Ottoman threat, and in defense of Christians everywhere.\"\n\nThe letter grants additional indulgences for those serving in Juan's crusade and encourages other Christian monarchs to support his efforts. It's written for maximum political impact—Rome actively promoting Juan's legitimacy and authority.\n\n2. Private Letter to Juan (Sealed)\n\nA shorter, more personal letter from Martin V to Juan alone:\n\nThe tone is warm, almost fatherly. The Pope expresses profound gratitude that Juan kept his word and delivered results beyond what Martin dared hope. He acknowledges his own approaching death and says seeing this crusade succeed gives him peace.\n\nMost significantly, he writes: \"You have proven yourself worthy of the trust we placed in you. Continue as you have begun, and history will remember you as among the greatest of Christian kings. We shall pray for you until our final breath, and we trust God will guide you in the years after we are gone.\"\n\nIt's a dying man's blessing to someone he believes will carry forward his legacy.\n\n3. Letters of Commendation\n\nCardinal Orsini provides separate letters of commendation that Diego can use in future diplomatic contexts—essentially Rome's official stamp of approval on Juan's character and crusade. These will be valuable for negotiations with other monarchs or securing future church support.\n\n4. Financial Commitment\n\nWhile no immediate additional funds are provided (the papal treasury is stretched), Cardinal Orsini privately assures Diego that the next Pope—whoever he may be—will inherit correspondence showing Juan as a proven crusader worthy of support. Several cardinals hint they would support financial assistance in future if Juan continues delivering results.\n\n5. Ahmad's Status\n\nAhmad was offered a position in Rome—essentially to stay and serve as a scholar/translator and living example of successful conversion. He politely declined, saying he wished to return to Castile and continue learning Christianity where his journey began. This actually impressed the cardinals more—it suggested genuine faith rather than opportunism.\n\nThe Curia provides Ahmad with a letter confirming his baptism and conversion as authentic and freely chosen, signed by multiple cardinals who examined him. This serves as protection against any future accusations of apostasy or false conversion.\n\n6. The Broader Impact\n\nPerhaps most importantly, the story is now spreading. Rome's chroniclers are writing about it. Letters are going out to other courts. Within months, all of Christendom will know about King Juan II of Castile's victory, the converted qadi, and the crusade that's actually achieving spiritual transformation.\n\nDiego reports that multiple cardinals specifically mentioned they're watching Juan's career with great interest. If he continues succeeding, if he actually completes the reconquista, Rome will have enormous interest in deploying him elsewhere—North Africa, supporting crusades in the East, wherever a proven crusader-king is needed.\n\nThe Journey Home\n\nThe embassy departs Rome in mid-June 1431, traveling back through Italy, France, and Aragon. The return journey takes another 4-5 weeks, putting their arrival back in Castile around late July/early August 1431.\n\nThey carry with them not just letters and documents, but also something less tangible: Rome's validation. Juan is no longer just a young king with ambitious plans. He's now recognized by the Church as a proven crusader delivering real results. That changes the political calculus for everyone—nobles, other monarchs, even his enemies.\n\nStatus Summary:\n\nEmbassy Status: Successful beyond minimum hopes, though not quite the legendary triumph of a 90+ roll. Pope deeply moved, cardinals largely enthusiastic, Ahmad's story captivating Rome, formal blessing and endorsement secured, Juan's reputation significantly elevated.\n\nTimeline: Embassy departed Jaén late April, arrived Rome late May, departed Rome mid-June, will return to Castile late July/early August 1431.\n\nCurrent Date in Jaén: Mid-April 1431 (embassy just left, results unknown to Juan)\n\nÁlvaro still stands in the war room, waiting for Juan's attention to return to the three pressing matters: the Íllora siege frustrations, Rodrigo's request for strategic direction at Vélez-Málaga, and the mysterious merchant letter from Granada.\n\nWhich issue does Juan wish to address first?"

          "text": "**Context from Project Knowledge:**\n- Master of Calatrava (Don Pedro González de Padilla) has 15,000 troops besieging Íllora\n- This started in mid-April 1431 (current time)\n- Granada has switched to guerrilla warfare tactics\n- Granada is fielding about 14,000 troops by mid-July (but not all at Íllora)\n- Moroccan reinforcements arriving (2,200-2,500)\n- Granada hiring mercenaries (3,500)\n- Granada's professional army is about 7,500-8,000\n- Castile has artillery (5 bombards with Pietro Calabrese, but they were sent to Jaén for the eastern army)\n- Master of Calatrava is frustrated and requesting additional siege equipment or permission to assault\n\n**Factors in Favor of Castilian Success:**\n- 15,000 troops is a substantial force\n- Master of Calatrava is experienced military commander\n- Íllora is not one of Granada's largest fortresses\n- Castile has resources and supply lines\n- Recent victory at Alcalá should provide morale boost\n- Professional Military Order troops (Calatrava knights and soldiers)\n- Can maintain siege for extended period\n\n**Factors Against Castilian Success:**\n- Granada using guerrilla tactics effectively\n- Fortress is well-defended and prepared\n- No heavy artillery deployed with this force (bombards are with Pietro at Jaén)\n- Guerrilla raids disrupting supply lines and bleeding troops\n- Granada motivated after Alcalá defeat\n- Siege warfare is slow and costly\n- Spring/early summer weather could complicate operations\n- Defenders can be resupplied or reinforced by guerrilla forces\n- Muslim fortresses in Iberia are notoriously well-built\n- Garrison knows relief might come\n \nThe siege presents a challenging military scenario. I see significant obstacles preventing a quick Castilian victory. The lack of heavy artillery creates a critical weakness, with the Master's own words revealing mounting frustration. Despite numerical superiority, the 15,000-strong force faces constant harassment from Granada's mobile forces. A prolonged engagement seems most likely, with substantial casualties and minimal territorial gains.\n\nSiege of Íllora Progress Assessment - D100 Table\n\nLet me evaluate the situation for the Master of Calatrava's siege (15,000 troops, mid-April 1431, approximately 2-3 weeks into the siege):\n\nFactors Strongly in Favor:\n\n15,000 troops is substantial force for siege\n\nMaster of Calatrava is experienced Military Order commander\n\nProfessional Calatrava knights provide quality core\n\nSupply lines from Jaén maintained\n\nMorale boost from Alcalá victory still present\n\nCan maintain prolonged siege with these numbers\n\nÍllora is mid-sized fortress, not Granada's strongest\n\nFactors Against:\n\nNO HEAVY ARTILLERY - bombards are with Pietro at Jaén for eastern campaign\n\nGranada's guerrilla tactics actively disrupting operations\n\nFortress well-prepared and provisioned after Alcalá warning\n\nGarrison motivated and determined after recent defeat\n\nSupply line raids bleeding resources and men\n\nSpring weather can complicate siege operations\n\nMuslim fortifications in Iberia are exceptionally well-built\n\nWithout artillery, options are: starve them out (months), mine walls (dangerous/slow), or assault (very costly)\n\nGarrison likely 400-800 defenders in strong position\n\nPossible relief attempts by Granada forces\n\nRealistic Assessment: Without siege artillery, this is a grinding, frustrating operation. The Master's complaint about \"bleeding men to guerrilla raids while accomplishing nothing\" suggests serious problems. Most likely outcome: minimal progress, mounting casualties from raids, growing frustration.\n\nD100 Table: Siege of Íllora Progress (3 weeks in)\n\n1-8: Disaster\nSiege failing catastrophically. Major guerrilla raid penetrates camp, destroys supplies, causes 200-400 casualties. Morale collapsing. Multiple breaches in siege line allowing resupply of fortress. Possible relief force approaching. Master of Calatrava considering withdrawal or desperate assault. Some troops deserting or refusing orders. Total casualties so far: 600-900 dead/wounded.\n\n9-20: Severe Setback\nSiege going very poorly. Constant guerrilla harassment causing 100-200 casualties. Several failed assault attempts repulsed with heavy losses. Fortress showing no signs of weakening. Supply lines seriously disrupted. Morale declining sharply. Troops exhausted and frustrated. No visible progress on breaching walls. Total casualties: 400-600 dead/wounded.\n\n21-40: Stalemate with Heavy Bleeding\nSiege essentially stalled. Fortress contained but not threatened. Guerrilla raids constant - killing 5-15 men daily, disrupting supplies, preventing mining operations. Without artillery, no way to breach walls. Assault attempts too costly. Fortress well-provisioned, can hold for months. Morale deteriorating. Master increasingly frustrated and requesting either artillery support or permission to withdraw. Total casualties: 250-400 dead/wounded.\n\n41-60: Slow Progress, High Cost\nSiege maintaining pressure but progress minimal. Fortress contained, some outworks taken, but main defenses intact. Guerrilla raids ongoing but somewhat contained (still 3-8 casualties daily). Mining operations attempted but dangerous and slow. Garrison determined. Some supply stress on defenders but not critical. No breakthrough imminent without artillery or months more siege. Morale declining but holding. Total casualties: 150-250 dead/wounded.\n\n61-75: Grinding Progress\nSiege making slow but real progress. Fortress investment complete, outworks captured, some damage to outer walls from mining/trebuchets. Guerrilla raids contained to manageable levels (2-5 casualties daily). Garrison still strong but showing some stress. Supply situation for defenders deteriorating slowly. Possible breakthrough in 4-8 weeks if pressure maintained, or sooner with artillery. Morale stable but troops weary. Total casualties: 100-180 dead/wounded.\n\n76-88: Significant Progress\nSiege progressing better than expected despite lack of artillery. Effective counter-guerrilla operations reducing raids significantly. Mining operations successful - one section of wall undermined and collapsed. Garrison forced to abandon outer bailey, concentrated in inner keep. Supply stress on defenders evident. Possible surrender in 2-4 weeks if pressure maintained. Morale good despite hardships. Total casualties: 60-120 dead/wounded.\n\n89-95: Major Success\nSiege going exceptionally well. Counter-guerrilla operations very effective - raids minimal. Successful mining collapsed major wall section. Defenders demoralized and low on supplies. Garrison commander requesting terms for surrender. Could fall within 1-2 weeks without assault. Master of Calatrava managed siege brilliantly despite lack of artillery. Total casualties: 40-80 dead/wounded.\n\n96-100: Unexpected Breakthrough\nExtraordinary success. Combination of factors (excellent mining, garrison supply failure, clever tactics, defender morale collapse, possible internal betrayal) leads to imminent fall. Garrison requesting immediate surrender terms, or keep about to fall to assault. Minimal casualties due to tactical brilliance. Total losses: 20-50 dead/wounded. Fortress will be in Castilian hands within days.\n\nThis table reflects that without artillery, a siege against a well-defended Muslim fortress in Iberia is extremely difficult. The most likely outcomes (41-75 range) involve slow, costly progress or stalemate. Higher rolls require exceptional leadership and luck.\n\nReady for you to roll."

          "text": "You're absolutely right. Let me check the project knowledge more carefully.\n\nLooking back at Chapter 14, I see:\n\n\"**Artillery Inspection**\n\nMaster Gunner Pietro Calabrese presents the artillery status:\n\n**Artillery Readiness:**\n- **5 medium bombards operational** (one rejected due to casting flaw)\n- Each fires 40-50 pound stone balls, 300-400 yard range\n- Rate of fire: 10-12 shots/day if pressed, 6-8 if careful\n- **5 trained crews** (6 men each = 30 gunners total)\n- **3 master gunners** (Pietro + 2 assistants)\n- Adequate gunpowder and hundreds of stone shot prepared\n- 40 oxen trained for transport\n\n**Pietro's Concerns and Needs:**\n- Good reconnaissance before siege commitments\n- Extra oxen teams (10 per gun vs 8, plus spares) for mountain terrain\n- Guaranteed infantry/cavalry protection during operations\n- Weather-protected powder transport\n- Authority to advise against tactically unsound sieges\n\n**Deployment Change:**\nJuan redirected the artillery to the **eastern army** (originally planned for western). Pietro will march toward Jaén in early March, arriving by month's end. He understands the eastern campaign is more opportunistic, requiring greater mobility and flexibility.\"\n\nSo yes - the 5 bombards were supposed to go with the eastern army under the Master of Calatrava. I made an error in my assessment. The Master of Calatrava DOES have the bombards with him for the siege of Íllora.\n\nThis changes the assessment significantly. With 5 medium bombards, the siege of Íllora should be progressing much more favorably than I described. Let me correct this.\n\nYou're absolutely correct, and I apologize for the error. Let me review the correct situation:\n\nEastern Army (Master of Calatrava): 15,000 troops advancing toward Granada, besieging Íllora, WITH the 5 bombards under Pietro Calabrese\n\nWestern Army (Rodrigo Manrique): 12,000 troops with naval support, has taken Vélez-Málaga\n\nReserve Force (Infante Enrique): 5,000 troops at Alcalá la Real\n\nYou're right - in Chapter 14, Juan specifically redirected the artillery to the eastern army. Pietro and the 5 bombards marched to Jaén in late March and would be with the Master of Calatrava's force.\n\nLet me completely redo the siege assessment table with the correct situation - the Master of Calatrava HAS the bombards, which dramatically changes the siege dynamics.\n\nSiege of Íllora Progress Assessment - D100 Table (CORRECTED)\n\nLet me re-evaluate with artillery present:\n\nFactors Strongly in Favor:\n\n15,000 troops is substantial force\n\n5 medium bombards with trained crews - can breach walls systematically\n\nPietro Calabrese's expertise in siege warfare\n\nMaster of Calatrava experienced commander\n\nProfessional Calatrava knights provide quality core\n\nSupply lines from Jaén maintained\n\nMorale from Alcalá victory\n\nArtillery can destroy defensive works methodically\n\nÍllora is mid-sized fortress, not Granada's strongest\n\nFactors Against:\n\nGranada's guerrilla tactics disrupting operations\n\nFortress well-prepared after Alcalá warning\n\nGarrison motivated after recent defeat\n\nSupply line raids bleeding resources\n\nMuslim fortifications well-built\n\nBombards are slow (6-12 shots/day per gun)\n\nWeather can affect powder and operations\n\nGarrison likely 400-800 defenders\n\nRealistic Assessment: WITH artillery, this siege should be progressing. The bombards can methodically breach walls. Main question is how effectively counter-guerrilla operations are going and how much the harassment is slowing things down.\n\nD100 Table: Siege of Íllora Progress (3 weeks in, WITH ARTILLERY)\n\n1-5: Disaster\nDespite artillery, siege failing. Major guerrilla raid destroyed powder supplies or damaged bombards. Artillery crews taking casualties from raids. Multiple breaches attempted but repulsed. Relief force approaching or major resupply succeeded. Morale collapsing. Total casualties: 400-600 dead/wounded. Master requesting immediate reinforcement or withdrawal.\n\n6-15: Poor Progress\nArtillery functioning but guerrilla harassment severely disrupting operations. Bombards firing intermittently due to security concerns and supply disruptions. Some wall damage but garrison repairing at night. Failed assaults costly. Supply line raids constant. Morale declining. Total casualties: 250-400 dead/wounded. Progress minimal despite artillery advantage.\n\n16-35: Slow Progress Due to Harassment\nArtillery creating damage but guerrilla raids slowing everything. Bombards must be heavily guarded, reducing available troops for other operations. Wall breaches being created but slowly. Garrison determined and repairing damage. Supply stress for both sides. Master frustrated - has tools to win but harassment bleeding him. Total casualties: 150-250 dead/wounded. Breakthrough possible in 4-6 weeks if harassment can be reduced.\n\n36-60: Steady Siege Progress\nArtillery doing its job - systematic bombardment creating wall damage. Guerrilla raids ongoing but manageable (not crippling operations). Outworks taken, outer walls breached in places. Garrison holding but under real pressure. Supply situation deteriorating for defenders. Counter-guerrilla operations partially effective. Morale stable despite challenges. Total casualties: 100-180 dead/wounded. Fortress likely to fall in 2-4 weeks.\n\n61-80: Good Progress\nSiege progressing well. Artillery systematically dismantling defenses - multiple breaches opened. Effective counter-guerrilla operations keeping raids minimal. Outer defenses fallen, garrison concentrated in inner keep. Defenders showing supply stress and declining morale. Possible surrender within 1-3 weeks. Master managing siege competently. Total casualties: 60-120 dead/wounded.\n\n81-92: Excellent Progress\nSiege going very well. Artillery highly effective - major sections of wall collapsed. Counter-guerrilla operations successful - harassment minimal. Garrison demoralized, low on supplies, requesting terms. Multiple breachable points. Could fall within days to week. Masterful siege management by Calatrava and Pietro. Total casualties: 40-80 dead/wounded.\n\n93-100: Imminent Victory\nOutstanding success. Artillery devastated defenses rapidly. Brilliant counter-guerrilla operations eliminated harassment. Garrison commander already requesting surrender terms - fortress about to fall. Minimal casualties due to excellent coordination between artillery, infantry, and cavalry operations. Total losses: 20-50 dead/wounded. Fortress will surrender within 2-5 days.\n\nThis corrected table reflects that WITH artillery, the siege should be making real progress. The question is mainly how much guerrilla harassment is interfering with operations.\n\nReady for you to roll when you're ready."

Relief force approaching or major resupply succeeded. Morale collapsing. Total casualties: 400-600 dead/wounded. Master requesting immediate reinforcement or withdrawal.\"\n\nThis is a serious setback. The Master of Calatrava has 15,000 troops and 5 bombards but the siege has gone catastrophically wrong. Given it's mid-April and the Sultan won't have his army assembled until June/July, a \"relief force approaching\" would likely be a smaller force - perhaps 2,000-3,000 troops that Granada scraped together from various garrisons, or mercenaries that arrived early, or possibly Moroccan advance forces.\n\nThe letter should:\n1. Come from Master of Calatrava (Don Pedro González de Padilla)\n2. Describe the disaster in military terms\n3. Explain what went wrong - probably a combination of:\n   - Devastating guerrilla raid on the siege camp\n   - Powder supplies destroyed or bombards damaged\n   - Failed assault attempts\n   - Relief force approaching\n   - Heavy casualties\n4. Request guidance - reinforcement or withdrawal\n5. Show his frustration and concern about morale\n\nThe tone should be professional but clearly showing this is a crisis. He's an experienced commander reporting a serious failure.\n\nLet me draft this letter appropriately.\n\nJaén Fortress - Mid-April 1431, Late Afternoon\n\nA courier arrived in the courtyard, his horse lathered and exhausted. The man himself looked haggard, mud-splattered, and moved with the urgency of someone bearing bad news. Within minutes, Álvaro de Luna was reading the dispatch in the war room, his face darkening with each line.\n\nHe looked up at Juan. \"Your Majesty... it's from the Master of Calatrava. The siege of Íllora.\" His voice was tight. \"It's not good.\"\n\nHe handed over the letter. The parchment bore the seal of the Military Order of Calatrava, but the wax was hastily applied, suggesting speed over ceremony.\n\nLetter from Don Pedro González de Padilla, Master of Calatrava\n\nTo His Majesty King Juan II of Castile, at Jaén\n\nWritten this 14th day of April, Year of Our Lord 1431, from the siege lines before Íllora\n\nYour Majesty,\n\nI write with the burden of reporting a grave setback to our operations against Íllora fortress. What began as a methodical siege has deteriorated into a crisis that demands your immediate attention and decision.\n\nThe Situation:\n\nWe invested Íllora three weeks ago with confidence. Our fifteen thousand troops established siege lines, Master Gunner Pietro positioned his bombards, and initial bombardment commenced as planned. The outer walls showed promising damage within the first week—two breaches were opened in the curtain wall facing our main approach.\n\nOn the night of April 11th, everything changed.\n\nA Moorish force—we estimate between eight hundred and one thousand raiders—struck our camp in a coordinated assault of exceptional sophistication. They came in three columns simultaneously: one against our powder magazine, one against the artillery positions, and one against the eastern picket line. The attack came during the changing of the night watch, exploiting a moment of transition with precision that suggests detailed intelligence of our routines.\n\nThe Damage:\n\nThe powder magazine was their primary target. They used fire—Greek fire or something similar, based on how it burned. We lost approximately two-thirds of our gunpowder reserves before we could contain the blaze. What remains is sufficient for perhaps five to seven more days of bombardment at reduced intensity, certainly not enough to complete the siege.\n\nTwo of Master Pietro's five bombards were damaged—not destroyed, but rendered temporarily inoperable. One took a direct hit from burning debris that cracked the barrel. The other's carriage was demolished. Pietro believes he can repair both given time and materials, but not here, not now, not under these conditions.\n\nWe suffered between four hundred and five hundred casualties—dead, wounded, or missing. Many of our artillery crews were killed defending the guns. The Moorish raiders withdrew before dawn, taking minimal casualties themselves, and melted back into the hills.\n\nCurrent Status:\n\nMorale among the troops has collapsed. Men who were confident three days ago now look over their shoulders constantly. The Moors demonstrated they can strike us at will, and our soldiers know it. Discipline is holding, but barely. I have executed two men for refusing picket duty and flogged a dozen more for dereliction. It has helped, but fear is spreading faster than I can contain it.\n\nWe attempted two assaults on the breaches we'd opened, hoping to capitalize on our earlier bombardment before the garrison could repair the damage. Both were repulsed with heavy losses—another eighty dead, perhaps one hundred fifty wounded. The defenders fought with desperate courage, and without adequate artillery support to suppress their positions during the assault, we could not press home the advantage.\n\nWorse still, our scouts report a relief force approaching from the south—perhaps two to three thousand troops, possibly Moroccan mercenaries or forces scraped together from Granada's southern garrisons. They are perhaps three to five days' march away. If they arrive before we can restore our siege effectiveness, we will be caught between a garrison that has proven resilient and a relief force at our backs.\n\nSupply line harassment continues unabated. We lose five to fifteen men daily to ambushes on our supply trains. The guerrilla campaign is bleeding us slowly but steadily.\n\nMy Assessment:\n\nYour Majesty, I have served the Military Orders for twenty-three years. I have commanded sieges in Andalusia and fought the Moors in a dozen campaigns. I do not write this lightly: we are failing here.\n\nWithout adequate powder, without full artillery capability, facing constant harassment and now a relief force approaching, I cannot take this fortress in any reasonable timeframe. Every day we remain costs us men and morale. The troops are exhausted, frightened, and increasingly convinced this siege is cursed.\n\nI see three options before us:\n\nFirst: Send immediate reinforcement—perhaps five thousand troops from the reserve at Alcalá, along with additional powder supplies and materials to repair the bombards. With fresh troops and restored artillery, we might yet take Íllora before the relief force arrives or defeat that force when it comes. But this commits more resources to what has already proven a costly operation.\n\nSecond: Withdraw in good order before the relief force arrives, preserving our army for operations elsewhere. This is a defeat, and the Moors will trumpet it across Granada. But we preserve fifteen thousand troops who can be deployed more profitably. The siege has cost us perhaps six hundred casualties already—withdrawal prevents that number from doubling or tripling in a desperate fight against both fortress and relief force.\n\nThird: Attempt one massive assault before the relief force arrives—throw everything at the breaches simultaneously, accept heavy casualties, but try to overwhelm the garrison through sheer weight of numbers before we're caught between two forces. This is desperate and will cost us dearly in blood, but it might succeed if God favors us and the garrison's morale breaks.\n\nMy Recommendation:\n\nYour Majesty, I reluctantly recommend withdrawal. This siege has become a trap. We lack the resources to complete it properly, and the approaching relief force threatens to turn this into a disaster far worse than what we've already suffered. Better to preserve our army intact and redeploy to targets where we can achieve success.\n\nHowever, I am your servant and the servant of this crusade. If you judge that Íllora must be taken regardless of cost, I will see it done or die in the attempt. If you can send reinforcement swiftly, perhaps we can salvage this operation. If you order withdrawal, I will conduct it in good order and ensure we inflict maximum damage on our way out.\n\nI await your orders with all urgency. The relief force marches, our powder dwindles, and our men's courage frays by the hour. Whatever your decision, it must be made swiftly.\n\nMay God guide your judgment in this dark hour.\n\nYour faithful servant in Christ,\n\nDon Pedro González de Padilla\nMaster of the Order of Calatrava\n\nPost Scriptum: Master Gunner Pietro wishes me to convey that the bombard damage is repairable given proper facilities—he estimates two weeks in Jaén with access to forges and materials. The powder shortage is the more critical immediate problem. He also notes with frustration that had we proper defensive arrangements around the magazine, this disaster might have been prevented. I have already ordered flogging for the officers responsible for that sector's security.\n\nÁlvaro set the letter down heavily. \"Your Majesty... this is a significant setback. Six hundred casualties, two-thirds of the powder gone, two bombards damaged, and a relief force approaching. The Master is right—this has become a trap.\"\n\nHe moved to the campaign map on the wall, pointing. \"Íllora is here, twenty miles northwest of Granada city. If Pedro withdraws, the Moors will claim they broke our siege. If he stays and is defeated by the relief force, it's far worse—potentially the loss of fifteen thousand troops.\"\n\nÁlvaro turned back to Juan. \"We need to decide quickly. The courier says the Master needs orders within two days to have time to act before the relief force arrives.\"\n\nWhat are Juan's orders?"

Withdraw, preserve the army, consolidate at Alcalá where we have secure supply lines and a fortress. Better to accept a setback than compound it into disaster.\"\n\nHe dipped his quill and began writing rapidly. \"I'll have three couriers ready within the hour.

Rodrigo at Vélez-Málaga.\" Álvaro set down his quill. \"He wrote asking for strategic direction. He's secured the port, the fleet is in good condition, his troops are eager. He presented three options: push toward Málaga, consolidate his position, or sweep east toward smaller coastal targets.\"\n\nÁlvaro moved back to the map, pointing to the coast. \"Vélez-Málaga is here, about twenty miles east of Málaga itself. He has twelve thousand troops and naval support. The question is: given what's just happened at Íllora, do we want the western army to remain aggressive, or do we want them to consolidate and hold what they've taken?\"\n\nHe traced the coastline with his finger. \"Arguments for continued aggression: Málaga is a major prize—largest port on Granada's coast, significant economic and strategic value. If Rodrigo can take it, that's a genuine victory that offsets the Íllora setback. Also, if we pull back everywhere, the Moors will sense weakness and press harder.\"\n\n\"Arguments for consolidation: Málaga is heavily defended—eight hundred to a thousand garrison, strong walls, and it's close enough to Granada city that they could send relief quickly. If Rodrigo gets bogged down in a siege and runs into the same problems Pedro faced, we've got two failed sieges instead of one. Consolidating at Vélez-Málaga secures our coastal foothold without additional risk.\"\n\nÁlvaro returned to his seat. \"There's also the consideration that you're moving to the eastern front personally. If the western army stays aggressive and something goes wrong, you'll be two weeks' hard riding away. If they consolidate, they're relatively safe while you handle the more immediate crisis.\"\n\nHe looked at Juan directly. \"What are your orders for Rodrigo and the western army?\""

          "text": "Juan is giving Rodrigo clear strategic direction but also making it clear that he expects independent decision-making from his commanders. This is good leadership - providing the strategic intent (secure the coast, press the advantage while Granada's forces are committed elsewhere) while empowering the field commander to make tactical decisions.\n\nThe reasoning is sound: if Granada sent 2-3,000 troops to relieve Íllora, they can't simultaneously defend Málaga in strength. This is classic strategic thinking - exploit the enemy's commitment elsewhere.\n\nJuan is also expressing mild disappointment that Rodrigo is asking for detailed orders rather than exercising initiative. This is interesting character development - Juan is growing as a commander and expects his subordinates to show similar initiative.\n\nI need to have Álvaro draft this letter, capturing Juan's strategic reasoning, his orders to be aggressive on the coast, and his expectation that Rodrigo exercise independent judgment. Then I should move the scene forward - the letters being sent, Juan preparing to depart for the eastern front, etc.\n\nÁlvaro's eyebrows rose slightly—a flicker of approval. \"Sound reasoning, Your Majesty. If Granada committed forces to relieve Íllora, they've weakened elsewhere. The western coast becomes vulnerable precisely when we're under pressure in the east.\"\n\nHe began writing, speaking aloud as he composed. \"I'll make your strategic intent clear: secure the coast, exploit Granada's divided attention, exercise initiative. And I'll... tactfully... convey your expectation that he command rather than request permission for every move.\"\n\nÁlvaro wrote swiftly, occasionally pausing to consider phrasing. After several minutes, he read back:\n\nDraft Letter to Captain Rodrigo Manrique, Commander of the Western Army\n\nFrom His Majesty King Juan II, at Jaén\n\n17th day of April, Year of Our Lord 1431\n\nCaptain Rodrigo,\n\nI write in response to your dispatch requesting strategic direction following your successful capture of Vélez-Málaga. First, let me commend you and your troops for the swift and decisive operation. The port is secured with minimal casualties—exactly what we hoped for.\n\nRegarding your question about next steps: I order you to advance on Málaga.\n\nMy reasoning is straightforward. Our scouts report that Granada has dispatched a relief force of two to three thousand troops toward Íllora, where the Master of Calatrava's siege has encountered difficulties. The enemy cannot be everywhere at once. If they commit forces to the eastern front, they necessarily weaken the west. Málaga, while substantial, cannot receive significant reinforcement while Granada's attention is divided.\n\nYou have twelve thousand troops, naval support, and control of a secure port at Vélez-Málaga. You have the tools to take Málaga, and the strategic situation favors aggressive action. The campaign season has just begun—we have months ahead. Use them.\n\nYour orders are not merely to take Málaga, but to secure as much of the entire coast as possible. Málaga is the priority, but beyond it lie other ports, other fortresses, other opportunities. As long as you have capability and Granada remains unable to concentrate against you, continue advancing the crusade.\n\nI will be frank, Captain: I was surprised to receive a letter asking what to do. I appointed you to command the western army because I trust your judgment and expect you to exercise it. You are not a messenger awaiting detailed instructions—you are a commander in the field with authority to make decisions.\n\nI provide strategic intent: secure the coast, exploit the enemy's divided attention, maintain pressure. How you achieve this is your decision. When to move, which targets to prioritize, how to manage your logistics and forces—these are your responsibilities, not mine to micromanage from Jaén.\n\nIf you encounter a situation where you genuinely need guidance or resources beyond your authority to provide, write to me. But do not write asking permission for decisions you are capable of making yourself. I trust you, Rodrigo. Command accordingly.\n\nThe Master of Calatrava is withdrawing from Íllora to consolidate at Alcalá la Real. This is a setback, and the Moors will attempt to portray it as weakness. Your success on the western front becomes even more critical now—we need victories to maintain momentum and morale.\n\nTake Málaga. Secure the coast. Show Granada that pressure on one front only exposes them on another.\n\nMay God guide your sword and your judgment.\n\nJuan II, by the Grace of God, King of Castile and León\n\nÁlvaro set down the quill. \"That should communicate both your strategic reasoning and your expectations clearly. Respectful but firm—he's a capable man who needs to be reminded to act like one.\"\n\nHe began preparing the three letters for sealing. \"I'll have these dispatched immediately. The courier to the Master of Calatrava will ride hardest—he needs those withdrawal orders soonest. The message to Enrique at Alcalá can go with a second courier, and Rodrigo's letter will go by the fastest route to the coast, probably through Córdoba to Seville and then to Vélez-Málaga.\"\n\nÁlvaro looked up. \"You said you're leaving tomorrow for the eastern front. What size escort are you taking? Just your immediate household, or something more substantial? And should I accompany you, or remain here in Jaén to coordinate communications and supply?\"\n\nHe gestured to the war room. \"With you in the field, someone needs to manage the central coordination—dispatches, supply convoys, maintaining the relay system between all three armies.

From the project knowledge, Isabel conceived in early March. It's now mid-April.

She looked up as Juan entered, and her expression shifted immediately—relief mixed with concern.

She's grown significantly - more confident, capable, the relationship has deepened. But she's also young (15), her husband is going into danger, and she may be pregnant. Her response should show:\n- Her love and concern for him\n- Her own strength and capability (she's grown)\n- Worry about him going into danger\n- The pregnancy uncertainty \n- Her commitment to take care of herself\n\nI should NOT write Juan's response or actions - only Isabel's reaction and anything else happening in the scene.\n\nIsabel's hand went unconsciously to her belly—the same gesture she'd made in the cathedral at Córdoba. Her eyes searched Juan's face, reading the gravity there.\n\n\"Artillery destroyed,\" she repeated softly. \"Men killed. You're riding toward...\" She didn't finish the sentence, but the fear was plain in her voice.\n\nShe closed the distance between them, reaching for his hands. \"Of course I'll take care of myself. And if I am carrying our child—\" Her voice caught slightly. \"I will guard that life with everything I have.

Let me think about the distance and situation:\n\n- Jaén to Alcalá la Real is roughly 50-60 miles southwest\n- The route goes through territory that was recently taken (Alcalá was captured in the Battle of Alcalá)\n- Granada's guerrilla forces are active in this region - they just successfully raided the siege at Íllora\n- Juan is traveling with his personal retinue (probably 50-100 people based on what he arrived at Jaén with)\n- The Master of Calatrava's army is withdrawing toward this area\n- There's a relief force from Granada that was heading to Íllora (2-3k troops) that might be in the area\n- This is wartime travel through contested frontier territory\n\nFactors in favor:\n- Juan has experienced escort\n- He's traveled these types of routes before\n- The route to Alcalá should be relatively secure since it's held territory\n- He's traveling quickly with a small group (faster than army)\n- Infante Enrique's forces at Alcalá can secure the area\n- The Moorish relief force is probably focused on Íllora area, not ambushing the king\n\nFactors against:\n- Active guerrilla warfare in the region\n- Granada just demonstrated they can conduct sophisticated raids\n- Juan is a high-value target\n- Traveling through frontier territory during active campaign\n- Morale among Castilian forces is shaken\n- Enemy might have intelligence about troop movements\n\nThis should be relatively safe but not without risk. Most likely outcome is safe arrival with minor incidents possible.\n\nJourney from Jaén to Alcalá la Real - D100 Table\n\nLet me evaluate the situation for Juan's journey (approximately 50-60 miles southwest, 2-3 days travel at speed):\n\nFactors in Favor:\n\nExperienced royal escort (veterans from original retinue)\n\nAlcalá la Real is now Castilian-held with Infante Enrique's 5,000 troops there\n\nSmall, mobile party can move quickly\n\nJuan has experience with frontier travel\n\nMain Moorish relief force focused on Íllora area to the north\n\nCaptain Fernán and guards are capable\n\nTraveling through recently secured territory\n\nInfante Enrique can provide security in Alcalá's vicinity\n\nFactors Against:\n\nActive guerrilla warfare throughout the region\n\nGranada just demonstrated ability to conduct sophisticated raids\n\nJuan is highest-value target in Castile - if identified, would draw attacks\n\nFrontier territory during active campaign\n\nMoorish raiders may be scattered through the area\n\nSome routes may be watched or ambushed\n\nWeather could complicate travel\n\nUncertainty about exact location of various forces\n\nRealistic Assessment: Should be relatively safe journey through held territory, but risk exists given active guerrilla campaign. Most likely: safe arrival with possible minor incidents.\n\nD100 Table: Journey to Alcalá la Real\n\n1-3: Catastrophe\nMajor ambush by large Moorish raiding force (200+ men). Coordinated attack, possibly targeting the king specifically. Heavy casualties among escort, Juan wounded or in serious danger, desperate fighting, possible capture attempt. Requires rescue or dramatic escape.\n\n4-8: Severe Danger\nSignificant ambush (50-100 raiders). Serious fighting, multiple casualties among escort, Juan's life endangered. Successfully fight through or escape but at high cost. Several guards killed, possible injuries to Juan or close companions.\n\n9-18: Dangerous Encounter\nAmbush by moderate raiding party (20-40 men). Real combat, some casualties (2-5 guards wounded/killed). Juan not directly threatened but serious situation. Successfully repel or evade attackers but shaken. Delays journey.\n\n19-35: Close Call\nEncounter scouts or small raiding party (5-15 men). Brief skirmish or tense standoff. Minor casualties or near-misses. Successfully avoid or drive off threat. Some delay and heightened tension but no disaster.\n\n36-60: Minor Complications\nSee signs of enemy activity (distant scouts, abandoned ambush sites, warnings from patrols). Take defensive precautions and longer routes. Some delays and nervous travel. Encounter Castilian patrols who provide intelligence. Arrive safely but journey is tense.\n\n61-80: Smooth Journey\nNormal wartime travel. Some caution required, occasional distant sightings of possible threats, but no direct encounters. Meet friendly patrols, receive updates. Arrive safely on schedule. Journey uneventful given circumstances.\n\n81-92: Favorable Journey\nJourney goes well. Good weather, clear routes, meet several friendly patrols who provide escort sections. Intelligence gathered from soldiers encountered. Arrive ahead of schedule in good condition. Perhaps witness withdrawing Calatrava forces and can assess situation firsthand.\n\n93-100: Exceptional Journey\nEverything goes remarkably well. Perfect conditions, excellent intelligence from patrols, perhaps personally witness and redirect some of withdrawing army elements effectively. Arrive early, fresh, with valuable firsthand observations. Possibly intercept useful intelligence or make strategic decisions en route that help situation.\n\nReady for you to roll."

          "text": "The parting at dawn was brief and private. Isabel stood in the courtyard as Juan mounted, the pale blue ribbon now tucked securely inside his tunic, close to his heart. She didn't cry, but her hand rested on her belly in that unconscious gesture as she watched him ride out with his escort—Captain Fernán, Sergeant García, Corporal Rodrigo, and fifteen veteran guards.\n\nThe morning was perfect for travel. Clear skies, mild temperature, roads dried from several days without rain. The party moved at a brisk pace southwest from Jaén, covering ground quickly.\n\nBy midday, they encountered the first Castilian patrol—a cavalry squadron from the Master of Calatrava's army, riding east toward Jaén. The patrol captain recognized the royal banner immediately and provided crucial intelligence:\n\n\"Your Majesty! The Master began withdrawal two days ago, as soon as your orders arrived. The main body of the army is moving southeast toward Alcalá, but they're conducting fighting withdrawal—rearguard actions to keep the Moorish relief force from harassing too aggressively. The Master is managing it well. No panic, good order, but they're bloodied and tired.\"\n\nMore importantly: \"The Moorish relief force stopped pursuing once they realized we were withdrawing. They've turned back toward Íllora to reinforce the garrison there. Seems they're content to claim victory from breaking the siege rather than risk a major engagement with our main force.\"\n\nThis was valuable. Granada was acting defensively, not pressing advantage. The withdrawal was proceeding cleanly.\n\nThe patrol also reported the roads ahead were clear of enemy activity—their scouts had swept the route thoroughly just hours before. They offered to escort Juan's party for the next ten miles, which Captain Fernán accepted gratefully.\n\nBy evening of the first day, the party had covered nearly forty miles—exceptional speed. They camped near a small fortified village that had been secured by Castilian forces weeks earlier. The local militia captain provided fresh horses and supplies, and reported that Infante Enrique's patrols from Alcalá were active throughout the region.\n\nDay Two - April 19, Early Afternoon\n\nThe second day's travel continued smoothly. Perfect weather held, the roads remained clear, and they encountered several more friendly patrols that confirmed the Master of Calatrava's withdrawal was proceeding without major incident.\n\nAround midday, as they crested a hill about ten miles north of Alcalá la Real, they spotted something significant in the valley below.\n\nA substantial column of troops—perhaps three to four thousand men—was moving slowly along the road toward Alcalá. The distinctive white surcoats of Calatrava knights were visible at the column's head, along with several large wagons that could only be the bombards. This was clearly a major section of the withdrawing army.\n\nBut what caught Captain Fernán's attention immediately was the column's formation. \"Your Majesty,\" he said quietly, pointing. \"They're deployed for march, not combat. Rearguard is thin—maybe two hundred cavalry trailing a mile back. And look there—\" He indicated the flanks. \"Minimal screening forces. They're moving fast but they're vulnerable.\"\n\nSergeant García, scanning the surrounding hills with experienced eyes, added his observation: \"Those ridges to the west, Your Majesty. Perfect ground for an ambush. If I were a Moorish raider watching this column, that's where I'd position.\"\n\nAs if summoned by his words, movement flickered on the western ridgeline—distant figures, too far to count accurately but definitely there. Scouts, at minimum. Possibly the vanguard of a raiding force positioning for attack.\n\nCorporal Rodrigo had the best eyes. \"I count maybe... fifteen, twenty riders on that ridge. Could be just scouts. Could be advance element of something larger. They're watching the column, that's certain.\"\n\nThe royal party sat on their horses on the hilltop, looking down at the vulnerable column and the potential threat developing on the ridge. The distance was perhaps two miles to the column, another mile to the suspicious ridge beyond.\n\nCaptain Fernán turned to Juan, awaiting orders. The situation was clear: a significant portion of the withdrawing Calatrava army was potentially about to be ambushed, and Juan had perhaps fifteen to thirty minutes to decide whether and how to intervene.\n\nThe escort was small—just twenty men total including Juan. Not enough to fight a major engagement, but possibly enough to make a difference if used cleverly. And the royal banner, if revealed, might have effects beyond mere numbers.\n\nWhat does Juan do?"

Success depends on: (1) staying hidden, (2) raider force size, (3) timing of strike, (4) column's ability to respond. Could be brilliant success or dangerous situation depending on execution and enemy numbers.\n\nI need to create a table that accounts for:\n- How well they stay hidden\n- Size of actual raider force\n- Timing and execution of counter-ambush\n\n- Raider response when hit from behind\n- Column's reaction and support\n- Overall outcome\n\nThe potential scenarios are complex. I'll map out potential responses to the surprise attack, considering the psychological and tactical implications of being ambushed while mid-raid. The raiders' initial shock could create a critical window of opportunity for Juan's small force to inflict maximum damage before they can effectively counterattack.\n\nCounter-Ambush at Alcalá Approach - D100 Table\n\nLet me evaluate Juan's tactical plan:\n\nJuan's Force:\n\n20 men total (Juan, Captain Fernán, Sergeant García, Corporal Rodrigo, 16 guards)\n\nAll veterans, experienced, disciplined\n\nSmall enough to move quietly and hide effectively\n\nRoyal banner (can be revealed for psychological effect)\n\nJuan's Plan:\n\nPosition to ambush the ambushers\n\nStay hidden until raiders commit to attacking column\n\nStrike from behind with full force\n\nPrioritize concealment over perfect positioning\n\nFactors Strongly in Favor:\n\nElement of complete surprise - raiders expect to ambush, not be ambushed\n\nStriking when raiders are committed and exposed\n\nVeterans skilled in this type of warfare\n\nSmall force easier to conceal\n\nGood defensive terrain with multiple concealment options\n\nPsychological shock value of unexpected attack from rear\n\nColumn of 3,000+ troops nearby can support once alerted\n\nRaiders will be focused entirely on column, not watching their rear\n\nFactors Against:\n\nUnknown raider force size (scouts visible suggest 15-20, but could be 50-200 total)\n\nIf discovered early, extremely vulnerable position\n\nJuan is highest-value target in Castile - his capture/death would be catastrophic\n\n20 men cannot fight prolonged engagement against large force\n\nTerrain that hides Juan also hides enemy reserves\n\nRaiders might scatter immediately when attacked, limiting damage inflicted\n\nColumn might not react quickly enough to capitalize\n\nCritical Variables:\n\nActual raider force size\n\nQuality of concealment\n\nTiming of strike\n\nRaider morale/discipline when surprised\n\nColumn's response speed\n\nD100 Table: Counter-Ambush Outcome\n\n1-5: Catastrophic Failure\nDiscovered before positioning complete. Raiders turn on Juan's force in overwhelming numbers (100+). Desperate fighting, royal party surrounded. Multiple casualties, Juan wounded or captured, potential disaster. Column too far to help immediately. Complete failure requiring rescue or miraculous escape.\n\n6-12: Severe Setback\nPoor positioning or discovered too early. Raiders (50-80) turn on Juan's force before counter-ambush triggers properly. Heavy fighting, serious casualties (5-8 guards killed/wounded). Juan endangered directly. Must withdraw under pressure. Raiders still attack column. Intervention fails and costs dearly.\n\n13-25: Partial Failure\nTiming off or raider force larger than expected (40-60). Counter-ambush triggers but raiders respond quickly. Brief fighting, some success but raiders break off and scatter. Moderate casualties (3-5 guards wounded). Raiders harass column anyway with reduced numbers. Limited success, Juan's gamble didn't pay off well.\n\n26-45: Mixed Result\nCounter-ambush works partially. Raiders (30-40) surprised but numerous enough to fight back. Intense skirmish, raiders take casualties but inflict some too (2-3 guards wounded). Raiders forced to withdraw but not routed. Column aware and deploys defensively. Ambush prevented but not decisively defeated. Juan's intervention helpful but costly.\n\n46-65: Modest Success\nCounter-ambush effective. Raiders (25-35) caught by surprise when they reveal themselves. Sharp fight, raiders take heavier casualties and break off. Light friendly casualties (1-2 wounded). Ambush on column prevented. Raiders withdraw but in reasonable order. Column grateful, morale boost. Solid tactical success.\n\n66-80: Clear Success\nCounter-ambush very effective. Raiders (20-30) completely surprised when struck from behind. Swift, decisive action breaks raider attack before it develops. Raiders scatter with significant casualties (8-12 killed/wounded). Minimal friendly casualties. Column safe, Master of Calatrava personally grateful. Clear tactical victory, morale boost for withdrawing army.\n\n81-92: Major Victory\nBrilliant execution. Raiders (20-35) caught completely off-guard and routed decisively. Counter-ambush perfectly timed—hit raiders just as they're positioning for attack. Heavy raider casualties (15-20+ killed/wounded/captured). No friendly casualties or only minor wounds. Prisoners taken. Column not only saved but witnesses royal courage. Massive morale boost. Story will spread through army.\n\n93-100: Legendary Success\nPerfect execution creating extraordinary result. Raiders (30-40) ambushed precisely at moment of maximum vulnerability. Devastating surprise attack routs them completely. Heavy enemy casualties (20-30+ killed/wounded), several high-value prisoners including raid commander. Zero or trivial friendly casualties. Royal banner's reveal at critical moment creates panic. Column witnesses their king personally saving them. Enormous morale impact across entire army. Story becomes legend. Master of Calatrava and troops deeply inspired. Strategic impact beyond tactical victory.\n\nThis table reflects that the plan is tactically sound and surprise is a massive advantage, but variables like enemy numbers and timing create significant variance in outcomes. The 46-80 range represents realistic success scenarios where the plan works as intended.\n\nReady for you to roll."

Minimal friendly casualties. Column safe, Master of Calatrava personally grateful. Clear tactical victory, morale boost for withdrawing army.\"\n\nI need to write this as a dramatic scene showing:\n1. Juan and his men positioning themselves carefully\n2. The raiders revealing themselves and preparing to attack\n3. Juan's counter-ambush striking at the perfect moment\n4. The raiders being routed\n5. The column's reaction\n6. Master of Calatrava's response\n\nI should NOT write dialogue or actions for Juan - I need to stop when he needs to speak or make decisions. But I can narrate the execution of his plan and the reactions of others.\n\nThe Counter-Ambush - April 19, 1431, Early Afternoon\n\nCaptain Fernán absorbed Juan's plan instantly. \"Ambush the ambushers,\" he repeated with grim satisfaction. \"Stay hidden, wait for them to commit, then hit them from behind. Your Majesty, that's sound tactics.\"\n\nHe turned to Sergeant García and Corporal Rodrigo. \"We move now, quietly. Leave the horses here with two men—we go on foot for better concealment. Form a skirmish line when we position, not a tight formation. We want to look like more men than we are when we hit them.\"\n\nThe royal party dismounted swiftly, leaving two guards with the horses. Eighteen men moved down the slope on foot, using the terrain expertly. These were veterans who'd fought on the frontier and traveled dangerous roads—they knew how to move unseen.\n\nCaptain Fernán selected the position carefully. Not the closest approach to where the raiders were gathering—that risked discovery. Instead, a fold in the hillside about three hundred yards behind where the Moorish scouts were assembling, with good cover from scrub oak and rocks. Far enough back to stay hidden, close enough to strike decisively once the raiders committed.\n\nThe royal party settled into position, weapons ready. From here, they could see the entire developing situation clearly.\n\nThe Waiting\n\nFor twenty minutes, nothing happened except careful observation.\n\nThe Calatrava column continued its steady march along the road below, oblivious to the threat. The white-surcoated knights at the head, the long train of troops, the lumbering wagons with the damaged bombards. Perhaps three thousand men, tired from days of siege and withdrawal, focused on reaching the safety of Alcalá.\n\nOn the ridge above, more Moorish raiders gathered. Corporal Rodrigo, watching with a soldier's practiced eye, counted carefully. \"Twenty-three now, Your Majesty,\" he whispered. \"Light cavalry, javelins and swords. No heavy armor—they're fast raiders, not shock troops.\"\n\nThe raiders were positioning themselves with professional skill. Spread along the ridgeline in a loose formation, waiting for the column to pass the optimal point—where the road narrowed slightly between two rises, limiting the column's ability to deploy defensively.\n\n\"Good commander,\" Captain Fernán muttered grudgingly, watching the raiders' dispositions. \"He knows his business. Waiting for the perfect moment.\"\n\nSergeant García gripped his sword. \"When they go, they'll go fast. Javelin throw from the ridge, then charge down while the column's in chaos. Hit and scatter before the Calatrava knights can organize pursuit.\"\n\n\"That's when we hit them,\" Captain Fernán confirmed quietly. \"When they're committed to the downslope charge—focused entirely forward, no watching their backs.\"\n\nThe Attack\n\nThe raider commander made his move. A sharp whistle cut through the afternoon air—the signal.\n\nTwenty-three Moorish cavalry surged forward from the ridgeline, loose formation, screaming their war cries. Javelins flew toward the column's flank. In the valley below, men shouted in alarm. The Calatrava column began trying to react, but surprise and confusion worked against them.\n\nThe raiders poured down the slope at full gallop, drawing swords for the melee, completely focused on the vulnerable column ahead.\n\n\"Now!\" Captain Fernán hissed.\n\nEighteen men erupted from concealment three hundred yards behind the raiders, moving at a dead run across the slope. No war cries yet—that would come later. Just swift, disciplined advance while the raiders were fully committed to their attack.\n\nThe distance closed rapidly. Two hundred yards. One hundred fifty. The raiders still hadn't noticed—they were crashing into the column's flank now, cutting down surprised soldiers, creating chaos exactly as planned.\n\nOne hundred yards.\n\nA raider on the high ground finally turned, perhaps hearing hoofbeats—no, footfalls. His eyes went wide. He shouted something in Arabic, pointing frantically back toward the approaching Castilians.\n\nToo late.\n\n\"Santiago!\" Captain Fernán roared, and eighteen voices took up the war cry. \"Santiago y cierra España!\"\n\nThe charge hit the raiders' rear like a hammer.\n\nSergeant García's sword took a raider from his horse in the first seconds. Corporal Rodrigo's spear punched through another's back. The veterans crashed into the scattered raiders with practiced brutality.\n\nThe psychological shock was total. The raiders had been hunting, and suddenly they were prey. Attacked from behind by screaming soldiers appearing from nowhere, their formation already scattered by the charge into the column, they had no coherent defense.\n\nSome tried to turn and fight. Captain Fernán's guards cut them down efficiently. Some tried to flee up the slope, away from both threats. Castilian soldiers from the column, recovering from the initial shock, began surging toward the melee from below.\n\nThe raider commander—a man in finer armor than his troops—tried to rally his men, shouting orders. Sergeant García and two guards drove straight for him. Steel clashed. The commander fought well, blocking García's first cut, but the second guard's blade took him in the side. He went down.\n\nWithin three minutes of the counter-ambush triggering, the raider force disintegrated. Perhaps eight or ten bodies littered the slope—dead or too wounded to flee. The rest scattered in every direction, individuals now, survival their only thought.\n\nCalatrava knights from the column charged up the slope belatedly, but the fight was already over. A few raiders were cut down by pursuing cavalry. Most escaped into the broken terrain, but as a fighting force they were finished.\n\nThe Aftermath\n\nCaptain Fernán surveyed his men quickly. \"Sound off!\"\n\nOne by one, the guards reported. Two men with minor cuts—scratches really, nothing serious. One twisted ankle from the charge. No serious casualties.\n\nEighteen men had routed a force of twenty-three raiders, killed or wounded nearly half of them, and sent the rest fleeing in complete disorder.\n\nCorporal Rodrigo stood over the body of the raider commander, breathing hard. \"He fought well. But not well enough.\"\n\nDown in the valley, the Calatrava column had halted and deployed defensively. Now, seeing the threat eliminated, knights were riding up the slope toward where Juan's party stood amid the aftermath of the brief, savage fight.\n\nThe lead knight wore the white surcoat and distinctive armor of a senior Calatrava commander. As he approached, his eyes widened in recognition—the royal banner, now being raised by one of the guards. And the young man standing calmly amid the carnage, sword still drawn.\n\nThe knight reined in sharply and dismounted immediately, dropping to one knee. \"Your Majesty! We... we didn't know you were...\" He looked around at the scattered bodies, the fleeing raiders, comprehension dawning. \"You saved us. You were watching and you saved the column.\"\n\nBehind him, more Calatrava knights arrived, their expressions shifting from combat alertness to shock as they recognized their king. Word rippled back through the column—the king, the king is here, he ambushed the raiders, he saved us.\n\nThe senior knight rose, still shaken. \"Your Majesty, I am Don García López de Padilla, commanding this section of the withdrawal. The Master is with the main body two miles behind. I must send word immediately—he will want to...\" He gestured helplessly at the scene. \"This will mean everything to the men. To know that you're here, that you saw them under threat and intervened...\"\n\nAlready, soldiers from the column were gathering at a respectful distance, staring at their king who'd just personally saved them from ambush. The exhaustion and demoralization visible in their faces was mixing now with something else—shock, gratitude, renewed determination.\n\nDon García's voice was thick with emotion. \"Your Majesty, the men have been... difficult days. The siege failed, we're withdrawing, morale has been fragile. But this...\" He looked at the battlefield. \"This changes everything.\""

          "text": "Juan wants to ride through the column to meet the Master of Calatrava. This is a dramatic moment - the king personally appearing among troops who are demoralized from a failed siege, having just saved part of their column from ambush. This should be a powerful morale moment.\n\nI should describe:\n1. The preparation - mounting up, banner being raised\n2. The ride through the column\n3. The soldiers' reactions as they recognize him\n4. The atmosphere and impact\n5. Meeting with the Master of Calatrava\n\nThis is about inspiration and leadership. Juan is showing up personally at a critical moment. The troops have been through hell at Íllora - the raid that destroyed their powder, failed assaults, constant guerrilla harassment, the humiliation of withdrawal. Now their king appears, having just personally fought to save them.\n\nI should not generate dialogue or actions for Juan - just describe what happens around him and stop when he would need to speak or act.\n\nThe Ride Through the Column\n\nThe royal party retrieved their horses quickly. Two guards carried the banner poles—the royal standard of Castile and León, brilliant against the afternoon sky. As Juan mounted, Captain Fernán ensured the banners were positioned prominently, visible from a distance.\n\nDon García López de Padilla dispatched riders immediately. \"To the Master! Tell him the king is here, riding to meet him!\" Then he fell in beside Juan's party as informal escort, along with a dozen Calatrava knights.\n\nThe ride down to the column and along its length began.\n\nThe first soldiers who saw the approaching party didn't understand immediately. Just mounted men riding from the hillside. But then the banners registered—the royal arms, unmistakable. Men began pointing, calling out to their companions. \"The king! It's the king!\"\n\nWord rippled through the column faster than the horses could ride. Soldiers who'd been trudging along, heads down with exhaustion and defeat, suddenly looked up. Officers shouted for formation, trying to impose some order, but discipline was fragmentary—men were pressing forward to see, to confirm what they were hearing.\n\nJuan rode slowly through the column, the banners streaming above him. The setting sun behind cast long shadows, making the scene almost theatrical—the young king on horseback, silhouetted against the light, riding through his battered army.\n\nThe soldiers' faces told the story. Shock first—genuine disbelief that their king was here, on this road, among them. Then recognition, verification spreading through the ranks. \"It's him!\" \"The king!\" \"He's really here!\"\n\nSome men simply stared, too exhausted or stunned to react. Others began shouting—loyalty oaths, cries of \"Castilla!\" and \"Santiago!\" A few wept openly. One veteran sergeant dropped to his knees as Juan passed, overcome.\n\nThe atmosphere was electric. These men had spent three weeks bleeding at Íllora, had suffered the humiliation of the powder magazine raid, had watched their siege fail, and were now withdrawing with their confidence shattered. They'd been trudging toward Alcalá feeling like failures.\n\nAnd now their king—the crusader who'd personally gone to Rome, who'd brought back the papal blessing, who'd promised them victory—was riding among them. Not sending orders from distant Jaén, but here, on this road, having just personally fought to save part of their column from ambush.\n\nSoldiers along the route began pressing closer, reaching out as if to touch his horse, his banner, anything. Officers struggled to maintain order. The column, which had been a dispirited withdrawal march, was transforming into something else—not quite a triumph, but no longer a retreat in shame.\n\n\"Make way for the king!\" Don García shouted, trying to create path. \"Maintain formation!\"\n\nBut the discipline was breaking down in the best possible way. Men wanted to see him, to witness that their king was with them. The story was already spreading backward through the column—the king ambushed the raiders who were about to hit us, saved the column, fought personally, and now he's riding to the Master.\n\nAhead, perhaps a mile down the road, Juan could see the main body of the army—the larger concentration of troops where the Master of Calatrava would be. Already, riders were galloping toward that position, carrying word ahead.\n\nThe column behind was transforming. The exhausted, defeated soldiers were standing straighter now, talking excitedly to each other, pointing at the royal banners. Officers who'd been struggling to maintain discipline and morale suddenly had something to work with—their king was here.\n\nAs Juan approached the main body, he could see organized activity ahead. The Master of Calatrava was clearly preparing to receive him—knights forming up, standards being raised, an attempt at proper military ceremony despite the circumstances of a withdrawal march.\n\nDon Pedro González de Padilla, Master of Calatrava, was visible now at the head of the main body. The man who'd written that anguished letter about the failed siege, about collapsing morale and requesting orders, was dismounting and moving forward on foot, clearly intending to greet his king personally.\n\nBehind the Master, hundreds of Calatrava knights and soldiers were forming into something resembling parade order—battle-weary, bloodied, but trying to present themselves properly for their monarch.\n\nThe Master waited, standing at attention in the middle of the road as Juan approached."

I need to have the Master respond to Juan's questions about the withdrawal and whether he received the orders.\n\nThe Master would be:\n1. Deeply emotional - his king just appeared personally after a devastating setback\n2. Relieved that the withdrawal orders came\n3. Grateful that Juan personally intervened to save part of his column\n4. Still carrying the shame/frustration of the failed siege\n5. Aware that Juan just witnessed the ambush and counter-attack\n\nThe Master should report on:\n- Receipt of withdrawal orders (yes, two days ago)\n- How the withdrawal has proceeded\n- Current status of the army\n- Casualties during withdrawal\n- Status of the bombards and equipment\n- Morale situation\n- His own emotional state regarding the failure\n\nI should NOT write dialogue or actions for Juan - just the Master's response and the scene around them.\n\nThe Master of Calatrava dropped to one knee immediately, his weathered face showing a mix of relief, gratitude, and lingering shame. Around him, the assembled Calatrava knights followed suit—a wave of white surcoats going to their knees.\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" the Master said, his voice thick with emotion. He looked up at Juan, and there were tears at the corners of his eyes. \"I... Your presence here, what you just did for my men...\" He struggled for composure. \"Thank you, Your Majesty. Thank you.\"\n\nHe rose at Juan's gesture, standing at attention though his hands trembled slightly. \"Yes, Your Majesty, your orders arrived two days ago. We began withdrawal immediately—April 17th, the moment the courier reached us. I cannot express my relief when those orders came. We were...\" He paused, choosing words carefully. \"We were in a dire situation, and your judgment was sound.\"\n\nThe Master gestured back toward the column behind them. \"The withdrawal has gone as well as could be hoped, under the circumstances. We conducted a fighting retreat—maintaining rearguard positions, denying the enemy easy pursuit. The Moorish relief force, perhaps twenty-five hundred men, pursued us initially but stopped once they realized we were withdrawing in force. They turned back toward Íllora yesterday, seemingly content to claim victory from our departure rather than risk a major engagement.\"\n\nHe looked troubled. \"Which they will claim, Your Majesty. Granada will trumpet this across the emirate—that they broke a Castilian siege, drove us away. I am... deeply conscious of this failure.\"\n\nRegarding the details: \"We have all fifteen thousand troops accounted for. Casualties during the withdrawal itself have been light—perhaps thirty killed, sixty wounded from rearguard skirmishes and the occasional raid. Nothing like the bleeding we suffered during the siege itself.\" His expression darkened. \"The siege cost us dearly. Between the initial raid on our powder magazine, the failed assaults, and three weeks of constant guerrilla harassment, we lost approximately six hundred men—dead, seriously wounded, or missing.\"\n\n\"The bombards are intact—both damaged guns are with us on the wagons. Master Pietro assures me they can be repaired in Jaén with proper facilities and time, perhaps two weeks' work. The other three guns are functional. But our powder...\" He shook his head. \"We have perhaps enough for one more day of bombardment, maybe two if conserved carefully. The raid destroyed most of our reserves.\"\n\nThe Master's voice grew quieter. \"Morale, Your Majesty, has been the deepest wound. The men felt defeated. We had the tools—the troops, the guns, the determination—but that night raid and the constant harassment broke something. They began to doubt. To fear. The withdrawal, while necessary, felt like... like we were running.\"\n\nThen his expression shifted, and something like hope entered his eyes. \"Until today. Until word spread that you were here. And then what just happened...\" He gestured toward where the ambush had occurred. \"Your Majesty, you personally saved Don García's column. You fought alongside common soldiers. Word is spreading through the entire army right now—the king is here, the king ambushed the raiders, the king rode through our column.\"\n\nHe looked directly at Juan. \"The men are exhausted and bloodied, Your Majesty, but what you've just done... they needed to see their king. To know they haven't been abandoned. That this setback doesn't mean the crusade has failed.\" His voice strengthened. \"Whatever you need from us now, we will give it. These men will follow you.\"\n\nBehind the Master, the assembled knights and soldiers watched intently. The entire main body of the army—thousands of men—had halted and was watching this exchange between their king and their commander. Despite their exhaustion, despite the failure at Íllora, there was something in their posture now that hadn't been there before.\n\nThe Master awaited Juan's response, his expression showing both shame at the failure and gratitude for the king's presence."

Can the Master follow these orders?\n\nThe Master should respond positively - these are sensible orders that address his concerns, show Juan understands the situation, and give clear direction. The Master wrote asking for orders and relief - now he's getting both, plus his king is here personally. He should be grateful and affirmative.\n\nThe Master of Calatrava's expression transformed from weary shame to visible relief. His shoulders straightened, and he nodded firmly.\n\n\"Yes, Your Majesty. Absolutely. Those orders are exactly what the army needs.\" He turned to several of his senior officers who'd gathered nearby. \"You heard the king. Begin organizing immediately.\"\n\nHe looked back at Juan. \"Alcalá has supplies—that's welcome news. Many of our troops are running on empty after three weeks of siege and then this withdrawal. Fresh provisions will do wonders for morale.\"\n\nRegarding the wounded and bombards: \"We have perhaps two hundred men too injured to continue campaigning—wounds from the siege and withdrawal that need proper care. I'll send them to Jaén with the artillery train. Master Pietro will be grateful for proper facilities and time to work without constant threat of raids.\"\n\nA slight smile crossed his weathered face. \"And frankly, Your Majesty, removing the sight of those damaged bombards from the men's view will help. Right now they're reminders of failure. Better they go away, get repaired properly, and return when we need them again—symbols of renewal rather than defeat.\"\n\nHe continued: \"The main body can reach Alcalá by tomorrow evening if we maintain current pace. Once there, rest and resupply as you've ordered. Infante Enrique's presence securing the area is good—means my men can actually sleep without full combat vigilance for the first time in weeks.\"\n\nThe Master's voice grew more confident as he spoke—a commander being given clear direction after weeks of uncertainty. \"How long do you envision us remaining at Alcalá for recovery, Your Majesty? A week? Two? I want to gauge what to tell the men—give them something concrete to work toward.\"\n\nAround them, the officers were already moving to execute orders, calling for unit commanders, organizing the separation of wounded and artillery for the Jaén convoy. The army was transforming from dispirited withdrawal into purposeful reorganization.\n\nThe Master looked at Juan with something approaching gratitude. \"Your Majesty, your presence here... I cannot overstate what it means. These orders are sound and necessary, but beyond that, the men seeing their king among them, fighting alongside them, taking command personally—that restores something that mere orders cannot.\"\n\nHe paused, then asked: \"Will you be remaining with us at Alcalá, Your Majesty, or returning to Jaén to coordinate the broader campaign?\""

Acknowledging the setback but maintaining perspective\n\nThe Master should respond with gratitude and renewed confidence. This is exactly what a demoralized commander needed - clear direction, his king's personal presence, and strategic context showing the broader crusade is still succeeding despite this setback.\n\nI should show the Master's relief and the impact on the surrounding officers/troops. Then probably move toward the arrival at Alcalá and establishing the command there.\n\nThe Master of Calatrava's face showed profound relief. \"Your Majesty, that is... that is exactly what we need to hear. And for you to stay with us...\" He seemed almost overwhelmed for a moment, then steadied himself.\n\n\"A few weeks to recover, secure the region, and prepare for the next move. Yes. That gives the men something concrete—not an indefinite period of shame and waiting, but a clear purpose leading to renewed action.\" He nodded firmly. \"And you're right, Your Majesty. We're focusing on Íllora because it's our immediate wound, but the broader picture is far more favorable.\"\n\nHe gestured as if indicating the wider strategic map. \"Alcalá la Real—a great victory. Vélez-Málaga taken on the coast. If Captain Rodrigo is indeed taking port after port as you say, that's devastating to Granada's economy and security. One failed siege doesn't undo all of that.\"\n\nThe Master's voice grew stronger as he spoke, as if Juan's words were reviving something that had been dormant. \"You're absolutely right, Your Majesty. We're winning this war. Granada bloodied us at Íllora, but they're losing the crusade. That's the truth my men need to remember.\"\n\nAround them, the officers who'd heard Juan's words were already beginning to pass them along. \"The king is staying with us.\" \"A few weeks, then we move again.\" \"The western army is taking ports—we're winning.\" The murmurs spread through the assembled troops like ripples in water.\n\nOne of the senior Calatrava knights, a grizzled veteran, stepped forward and spoke with surprising emotion. \"Your Majesty, permission to speak plainly?\"\n\nAt Juan's nod, he continued: \"We've been feeling like failures. Like we let down the crusade, let down you, let down God. But you're here. You fought beside us today. You're not abandoning us or treating us like broken tools. You're...\" He struggled for words. \"You're treating us like we're still your army. Still capable. Still worthy. That means everything.\"\n\nThe Master nodded at his knight's words. \"He speaks truth, Your Majesty. What you've done today—the ambush, riding through the column, these orders, your presence—you've restored something we'd lost.\"\n\nHe straightened to full attention. \"We'll reach Alcalá tomorrow evening. We'll rest, resupply, heal our wounded, and secure the surrounding territory as you've ordered. And in a few weeks, when you give the word, this army will be ready to fight again. You have my oath on it.\"\n\nBehind him, the assembled officers and troops—thousands of men who could hear or were being told what was happening—showed visible transformation. Backs straightening, faces lifting, voices growing more confident. Not erasing the exhaustion or the failure, but placing it in context. They were still soldiers in a winning crusade, led by a king who fought alongside them.\n\nThe Master managed something close to a smile. \"Shall we continue the march to Alcalá, Your Majesty? The men will march with far better spirit knowing you're riding with us.\"\n\nThe remainder of the march to Alcalá la Real proceeded with dramatically different atmosphere than the withdrawal that had preceded it. Word of Juan's presence, the ambush, and his orders spread through the entire fifteen-thousand-man army. By the time the column reached Alcalá the following evening (April 20th), what had been a demoralized retreat had transformed into something closer to a purposeful redeployment.\n\nStatus Summary:\n\nDate: April 20, 1431, Evening\nLocation: Alcalá la Real\n\nEastern Army Status:\n\n15,000 troops arrived at Alcalá\n\n~200 seriously wounded being sent to Jaén\n\n5 bombards (2 damaged) being sent to Jaén for repairs\n\nCasualties from entire Íllora operation: ~600 dead/wounded\n\nMorale: Recovering significantly due to king's presence\n\nForces at Alcalá:\n\nEastern Army: 14,800 combat-effective troops\n\nReserve Force: 5,000 under Infante Enrique\n\nTotal: ~19,800 troops\n\nImmediate Plans:\n\n2-3 weeks rest and resupply at Alcalá\n\nSecure surrounding villages and territory\n\nCounter-guerrilla operations\n\nRestore army's fighting capability\n\nJuan staying with army personally\n\nOther Forces:\n\nWestern Army: 12,000 at Vélez-Málaga, advancing toward Málaga\n\nWounded/Artillery convoy: En route to Jaén\n\nWhat does Juan wish to do upon arriving at Alcalá?"

Granada knows exact Castilian positions and strength. Enemy counter-intelligence completely effective—almost no useful information gathered. Possible major enemy force positioning nearby that scouts failed to detect. Dangerous intelligence gap that could lead to strategic surprise.\n\n6-12: Poor Intelligence\nHeavy scout casualties (10-20 killed/captured). Granada's counter-scouting very effective. Minimal useful information gathered—only basic defensive dispositions of nearest fortresses. No intelligence on Granada's army assembly, Moroccan reinforcements, or strategic intentions. Several contradictory reports suggesting enemy deception operations. Cannot plan confidently with this intelligence.\n\n13-25: Limited Intelligence\nModerate scout casualties (5-10). Gathered basic tactical intelligence about immediate area—nearby fortress strengths, guerrilla patrol patterns, local terrain. But little strategic intelligence. Vague reports about army assembly in Granada but no specifics. Moroccan reinforcement rumors but unconfirmed. Enough to operate locally but insufficient for strategic planning.\n\n26-45: Adequate Tactical Intelligence\nLight scout casualties (2-5). Good intelligence on immediate operational area—fortress dispositions within 20 miles, guerrilla operating patterns, supply routes, terrain obstacles. Some strategic intelligence: confirmation Granada assembling army, estimates of 8,000-12,000 troops, vague timeline (months away). Moroccan reinforcements confirmed arriving but numbers unclear. Enough to plan local operations confidently.\n\n46-65: Good Intelligence\nMinimal scout casualties (0-2). Excellent tactical intelligence on 30-mile radius—detailed fortress assessments, guerrilla base locations, supply depots, route security. Solid strategic intelligence: Granada assembling ~10,000-14,000 troops by mid-summer, Moroccan reinforcements 2,000-3,000 confirmed, mercenary hiring ongoing. Sultan's court divided on strategy. Coastal defenses weakened by western army's success. Can plan operations with confidence.\n\n66-80: Excellent Intelligence\nNo significant casualties. Comprehensive tactical intelligence—detailed assessments of all fortresses within 40 miles, complete guerrilla order of battle, supply network mapped. Strong strategic intelligence: Granada fielding 12,000-15,000 by July, specific Moroccan numbers (2,500), mercenary contracts identified, timeline clear. Intelligence on Sultan's strategic debates—some favor offensive, others defensive consolidation. Western army's coastal campaign causing panic. Political divisions emerging. Actionable intelligence for campaign planning.\n\n81-92: Outstanding Intelligence\nComplete tactical picture plus exceptional strategic intelligence. All nearby fortresses assessed with garrison strengths, leadership, morale, supply status. Guerrilla networks thoroughly mapped. Granada's army: 14,000-16,000 by mid-July, composition details (Moroccan 2,500, mercenaries 3,500, regular troops 8,000-10,000). Sultan's court divided—military commanders want offensive to reclaim Alcalá, qadis counsel defense, merchant class suffering from coastal losses. Specific fortress vulnerabilities identified. Possibly captured documents or high-value prisoner providing inside information.\n\n93-100: Exceptional Intelligence Coup\nEverything above PLUS major intelligence breakthrough. Either: high-ranking defector from Granada, captured enemy courier with strategic documents, turned Granada spy providing ongoing intelligence, or successful infiltration of Granada city itself. Complete picture of enemy dispositions, intentions, timeline, internal politics. Knowledge of specific upcoming operations. Identifiable weaknesses and opportunities. Possibly information about succession crisis or internal revolts. Intelligence advantage that enables decisive strategic planning.\n\nThis table reflects that gathering intelligence in active wartime against skilled opponents is difficult, but experienced scouts operating from secure base for two weeks should gather useful information. The 46-80 range represents realistic good outcomes.\n\nReady for you to roll."

          "text": "Juan rolled 26, so he gets adequate tactical intelligence - good local information but limited strategic intelligence. Let me craft what the scouts have reported, staying true to the roll result.\n\nThe council would include:\n- Master of Calatrava (Don Pedro González de Padilla)\n- Infante Enrique (commanding reserve force)\n- Senior military commanders\n- Possibly Captain Fernán and other trusted advisors\n\nI need to present the intelligence briefing naturally through the council members responding to Juan's question. The information should be:\n- Excellent on immediate area (20 mile radius)\n- Good tactical details on fortresses, guerrilla patterns, terrain\n- Basic strategic intelligence - Granada assembling army, rough numbers, vague timeline\n- Moroccan reinforcements confirmed but details unclear\n- Enough to plan local operations but not comprehensive strategic picture\n\nI should NOT generate dialogue or actions for Juan - just present what his commanders/advisors tell him in response to his question.\n\nWar Council - Alcalá la Real, May 4, 1431\n\nThe council chamber in Alcalá's fortress was crowded but organized. The Master of Calatrava sat at Juan's right, Infante Enrique at his left. Senior commanders from both the eastern army and reserve force filled the remaining seats—knights of the Military Orders, experienced frontier captains, and Juan's personal advisors including Captain Fernán.\n\nMaps covered the large table, marked with notations from two weeks of scouting reports.\n\nAt Juan's question, the Master of Calatrava gestured to one of his senior knights, Don Rodrigo de Perea, who'd been coordinating the reconnaissance efforts. The knight stood and moved to the map.\n\n\"Your Majesty, we've gathered substantial intelligence on our immediate operational area, though our strategic picture remains incomplete.\" He indicated the map with a pointer. \"I'll begin with what we know with confidence.\"\n\nTactical Intelligence - Immediate Area:\n\n\"Within twenty miles of Alcalá, we have excellent information. Our cavalry has been thorough.\"\n\nHe pointed to positions on the map. \"Íllora fortress—here, twenty miles northwest. Garrison strength now estimated at 650-700 men, reinforced after we withdrew. The relief force that drove us off has largely dispersed, but they left perhaps 200 additional troops to strengthen the position. Commander is Muhammad al-Rashid, experienced and competent. The fortress is well-supplied and alert. Our bombardment damage has been partially repaired—they worked fast. Taking Íllora now would require another full siege with adequate powder supplies.\"\n\nHe moved the pointer. \"Moclín fortress—fifteen miles west. Garrison approximately 400 men. Strong position on high ground, commands approaches from this direction. Has not been reinforced—they're maintaining normal defensive posture. Commander unknown, but scouts report garrison discipline is good.\"\n\n\"Montefrío—twelve miles southwest. Smaller fortress, perhaps 200-250 garrison. Less formidable than Íllora or Moclín, but still defensible. Overlooks agricultural valleys that supply Granada city.\"\n\n\"Loja—twenty-five miles south-southeast. Major fortress, 800-1,000 garrison. One of Granada's strongest positions. We haven't probed closely—too strong and too alert.\"\n\nInfante Enrique interjected, his voice carrying the rough authority of a frontier soldier. \"We've secured everything within ten miles of Alcalá. Fourteen villages and three minor fortified positions—all now under our control. Local populations are... compliant. Some fled to Granada, most stayed. We've established supply depots and patrol routes. The immediate area is secure.\"\n\nDon Rodrigo continued: \"Guerrilla activity—this is where our intelligence is strongest. The Moorish raiders operate in bands of fifteen to forty men, based from hidden camps in the hill country. We've identified at least eight separate operating groups within our scouting range.\"\n\nHe marked locations. \"Three camps confirmed here, here, and here. We've destroyed two of them—killed perhaps thirty raiders total, scattered the rest. The guerrillas are skilled but not invincible. They avoid direct confrontation with our stronger patrols. Their tactics: ambush supply trains, harass isolated units, withdraw before we can bring force to bear.\"\n\n\"Current assessment: guerrilla activity has decreased significantly in the past week. Whether that's because we've hurt them, or because they're consolidating elsewhere, we cannot say for certain.\"\n\nStrategic Intelligence - Limited:\n\nDon Rodrigo's expression became more cautious. \"Beyond our immediate area, Your Majesty, our intelligence becomes less certain. We have reports, but they're incomplete and sometimes contradictory.\"\n\n\"Granada's main army—all sources confirm the Sultan is assembling a major force. Our best estimate is eight thousand to twelve thousand troops, possibly more. The assembly point appears to be near Granada city itself, though we cannot confirm exact locations or dispositions. Timeline is vague—most sources suggest the force won't be fully assembled until summer, perhaps June or July.\"\n\nThe Master of Calatrava added, \"That matches what we'd expect, Your Majesty. Assembling, training, and provisioning a force that size takes months, especially after the losses they suffered at Alcalá.\"\n\nDon Rodrigo nodded. \"Moroccan reinforcements—confirmed to be arriving. Multiple sources report ships from Morocco landing on Granada's southern coast. Numbers are unclear—estimates range from one thousand to four thousand troops. We believe the real number is probably in the middle, perhaps two thousand to twenty-five hundred. They're professional soldiers, well-equipped. Arrival timeline unclear—some may already be in Granada, others still crossing.\"\n\n\"Mercenaries—the Sultan is definitely hiring. We've heard reports of Christian mercenaries from Aragon and Navarre, and Muslim mercenaries from North Africa beyond the Moroccan contingent. No reliable numbers. Could be hundreds, could be thousands.\"\n\nA pause. \"Coastal situation—this intelligence is secondhand, but multiple sources confirm that Captain Rodrigo's western army has Granada deeply concerned. The loss of Vélez-Málaga is causing economic disruption. We've heard rumors he may be advancing toward Málaga itself, but we have no confirmation or timeline.\"\n\nDon Rodrigo stepped back from the map. \"That's the sum of what we know with confidence, Your Majesty. Excellent tactical intelligence for local operations. Adequate strategic intelligence to understand the broad situation, but insufficient for detailed campaign planning against Granada's main force.\"\n\nCaptain Fernán spoke up from his position near Juan. \"We lost four scouts during this period, Your Majesty—three killed in ambushes, one missing and presumed captured. The Moors are watching for our patrols and defending their intelligence aggressively.\"\n\nInfante Enrique leaned forward. \"The question before us, Your Majesty, is what we do with this information. We control the immediate area. We know the enemy fortresses nearby. We know Granada is assembling an army but it won't be ready for months. So—do we wait here, do we strike at nearby targets, or do we maneuver for something larger?\"\n\nThe council fell silent, waiting for Juan's response to the intelligence briefing and Enrique's question.\n\nWhat does Juan wish to discuss or decide?"

          "text": "Juan is asking about the feasibility of taking Loja fortress without artillery. Let me consider what the council members would know:\n\n1. Loja is described as a major fortress with 800-1,000 garrison - one of Granada's strongest positions\n2. The Castilian army just failed at Íllora (which had 400-800 garrison) even WITH artillery, due to guerrilla harassment and other factors\n3. The bombards are in Jaén being repaired - won't be ready for ~2 weeks from the council date\n4. The army has 19,800 troops available (14,800 from eastern army + 5,000 reserve)\n5. Granada's main army won't be assembled until June/July - so they have a time window\n\nThe council would realistically assess:\n- Without artillery, options are: starve them out (months-long siege), mining (dangerous and slow), or direct assault (extremely costly)\n- Loja is stronger than Íllora, which they failed to take\n- They have more troops now but same fundamental problem\n- Mining and starvation are possible but time-consuming\n- Granada could potentially relieve a siege with their assembling army\n\nThe Master of Calatrava and other experienced siege commanders would give an honest assessment. They just failed at Íllora - they'd be realistic about another siege without proper tools.\n\nThe Master of Calatrava exchanged glances with several of his senior commanders before responding. His expression was troubled.\n\n\"Your Majesty, I must be honest with you—especially after Íllora.\" He stood and moved to the map, pointing at Loja's position. \"Loja is significantly stronger than Íllora. Eight hundred to a thousand garrison in one of Granada's best-fortified positions. And we just spent three weeks failing to take Íllora, which was smaller and weaker.\"\n\nHe traced the terrain around Loja. \"Without artillery, we have three options for taking any fortress: starve them out, mine the walls, or assault directly. Let me assess each honestly.\"\n\nStarvation Siege:\n\n\"Loja is well-supplied and alert. A starvation siege would take months—four to six at minimum, possibly longer if they're well-provisioned. We'd need to maintain complete investment with our nineteen thousand troops, exposed to constant guerrilla harassment the entire time.\" He shook his head. \"And Granada is assembling their main army. If we're locked into a siege at Loja when that force—twelve thousand or more—arrives in July, we're caught in exactly the trap we just escaped at Íllora. Between fortress and field army.\"\n\nMining:\n\n\"Mining is possible, but extremely slow without artillery suppressing the defenders. At Íllora, we attempted it—lost men to sorties, counter-mining, and the constant need to defend the sappers. With a garrison of eight hundred to a thousand, Loja can conduct aggressive defense. Mining could take weeks or months, with no guarantee of success.\"\n\nInfante Enrique interjected bluntly. \"And the guerrillas would bleed us the whole time. That's what broke us at Íllora—not the fortress itself, but the constant raids on our supplies and patrols. Loja is deeper into Granada's territory. The harassment would be worse.\"\n\nDirect Assault:\n\nThe Master's expression darkened. \"Assault without artillery means throwing men at walls defended by nearly a thousand troops in strong positions. Your Majesty, I commanded assault attempts at Íllora against weaker defenses. We lost eighty dead and one hundred fifty wounded in two attempts, and we failed both times. Assaulting Loja would cost us... conservatively, five hundred to a thousand casualties. Possibly more. And success is far from certain.\"\n\nDon Rodrigo de Perea, the reconnaissance coordinator, added: \"The scouts who observed Loja reported the defenses are formidable, Your Majesty. Multiple walls, strong towers, good fields of fire. It's designed to resist exactly the kind of siege we'd mount.\"\n\nThe Artillery Question:\n\nThe Master returned to his seat. \"Your Majesty, the bombards are in Jaén being repaired. Master Pietro estimates two weeks—they should be operational again within days of this council, if his timeline holds. With the artillery, our options change dramatically. We can breach walls systematically, suppress defenders during assaults, and take fortresses in weeks rather than months.\"\n\nHe met Juan's eyes directly. \"My professional judgment: attempting Loja without artillery is strategically unwise. We'd be committing to a months-long siege, bleeding men to guerrillas, and potentially trapped when Granada's army assembles. The risk far outweighs the potential gain.\"\n\nCaptain Fernán spoke up. \"There's also the morale question, Your Majesty. The men have recovered significantly because of your presence and the rest here. But asking them to march to another major siege immediately, without the artillery that failed us at Íllora... that's asking a lot.\"\n\nInfante Enrique leaned back in his chair. \"So the question becomes: if we're not taking Loja without cannons, what do we do? Wait here for the bombards? Strike at smaller targets? Something else?\"\n\nThe council waited for Juan's thoughts on the assessment and what direction he wished to take."

Military considerations:\n- 10,000 troops is substantial but mobile\n- Leaving 9,800 at Alcalá (good garrison)\n- Can move faster than full army with supply train\n- Living off the land reduces logistical tail\n- Can destroy economic/military infrastructure\n- Avoids getting stuck in sieges\n\n3. Risks:\n- Deep penetration into enemy territory\n- Guerrilla harassment\n- Could get caught if Granada assembles faster than expected\n- Fortresses won't fall but could be raided\n- Morale risk if it looks like aimless raiding vs purposeful conquest\n\n4. Historical context: This is very similar to medieval chevauchées - destructive raids meant to damage enemy capacity and morale. The English did this extensively in France during Hundred Years War.\n\nThe council would have mixed views:\n- Master of Calatrava: Probably cautious after Íllora, but might see merit in mobile operations vs static siege\n- Infante Enrique: As a frontier fighter, might appreciate aggressive action\n- Others would debate risks vs rewards\n\nLet me have the council discuss this realistically.\n\nThe proposal created immediate reaction around the table. Several commanders exchanged glances, clearly considering the idea. Infante Enrique leaned forward with visible interest.\n\nThe Master of Calatrava spoke first, his tone thoughtful rather than dismissive. \"A raid in force toward Granada itself... Your Majesty, that's bold. Let me think through this strategically.\"\n\nHe stood again, moving to the map. \"The concept has merit. Granada's main army won't be ready until summer—June or July at earliest. Right now, in early May, they have perhaps three to four thousand troops scattered across their fortresses and maybe another thousand or two in mobile reserves. They're vulnerable in the field, even if their fortresses are strong.\"\n\nInfante Enrique spoke with enthusiasm. \"This is frontier warfare, Your Majesty. We've done this for generations—fast-moving columns penetrating deep, destroying the enemy's capacity to make war, then withdrawing before they can concentrate against us. Ten thousand troops is a hammer. We could devastate the countryside around Granada.\"\n\nDon Rodrigo de Perea nodded slowly. \"The guerrillas operate in bands of twenty to forty men. Against a concentrated force of ten thousand? They'd harass us, certainly, but they couldn't stop us. And if we're not tied to a siege line, we can maneuver—force them to react to us rather than picking us apart while we're static.\"\n\nWhat Could Be Accomplished:\n\nThe Master began listing possibilities, pointing at the map. \"A mobile force of ten thousand, operating for... what, two to three weeks before needing to return? We could achieve several objectives.\"\n\n\"Economic destruction—the Vega of Granada, here, is their agricultural heartland. Burn crops, destroy mills, wreck irrigation systems. That doesn't take fortresses, but it devastates their ability to feed their army and population. Summer harvest is approaching—destruction now would hurt them for the entire campaign season.\"\n\n\"Military infrastructure—supply depots, training camps, anything outside fortress walls. Destroy it. Force Granada to withdraw resources inside fortifications where they're less useful.\"\n\n\"Psychological impact—a Castilian army raiding the gates of Granada city itself while their Sultan cowers inside? That's humiliating. It shows their 'victory' at Íllora means nothing. We're still the aggressors, still dominant.\"\n\n\"Force dispersion—if we're raiding across a wide area, Granada must disperse their limited forces to defend multiple points. That prevents them from concentrating for offensive operations and slows their army assembly.\"\n\nCaptain Fernán added pragmatically: \"And Your Majesty is right about supplies. A mobile force can carry provisions for two weeks, forage for some additional needs, and return before logistics become critical. We're not maintaining a static siege line requiring constant supply convoys that guerrillas can attack.\"\n\nRisks and Concerns:\n\nThe Master's expression grew more serious. \"Now the risks, Your Majesty, and they're real.\"\n\n\"Deep penetration—Granada city is forty miles from here, through enemy territory. That's two days' march in, two days back, plus whatever time we operate there. If Granada assembles forces faster than we expect, or if we misjudge their capability, we could be caught deep in their territory.\"\n\n\"Fortresses behind us—Íllora, Moclín, Montefrío, Loja. All these fortresses would be between us and Alcalá. They can't stop us, but they can harass our return, and if we take significant casualties on the raid, fighting our way back past hostile fortresses becomes more dangerous.\"\n\n\"No conquests—we're not taking territory or fortresses. We're destroying and withdrawing. Some might see that as... less legitimate than conquest. Like we're raiding because we can't take fortresses.\" He paused. \"Though I personally think devastation is valuable even without territorial gains.\"\n\nDon García López de Padilla, who'd commanded the column Juan saved from ambush, spoke up. \"There's also the question of the men's morale, Your Majesty. They've rested here for two weeks and recovered somewhat. But marching them immediately on a risky deep raid might... well, it depends on how you present it. If it feels purposeful and aggressive, morale could actually improve. If it feels like aimless destruction because we can't take fortresses, that's different.\"\n\nInfante Enrique waved dismissively. \"The men will follow if the king leads. Especially after what you did on the march here.\" He looked at Juan. \"But you'd need to go personally, Your Majesty. This isn't an operation to manage from Alcalá. If you're proposing this, you're proposing to ride at the head of ten thousand troops to Granada's gates.\"\n\nForce Composition:\n\nThe Master considered. \"Ten thousand from our nineteen thousand. That leaves nearly ten thousand here to garrison Alcalá and the secured territory. Defensible if Granada tries anything unexpected.\"\n\n\"For the raid force, I'd recommend: six thousand infantry for the heavy work—destroying infrastructure, protecting foragers, holding positions. Four thousand cavalry for mobility, screening, pursuit of fleeing enemies, and rapid exploitation of opportunities. Mix of knights and lighter cavalry.\"\n\n\"No artillery—we're mobile. No heavy baggage train—basic supplies only. Plan for two weeks in the field, perhaps three at most.\"\n\nThe Question:\n\nThe Master looked at Juan directly. \"Your Majesty, this is strategically sound IF the intelligence is correct that Granada won't have major forces ready for weeks. It's aggressive, maintains initiative, and damages their capacity. But it's also risky—deep penetration with no territorial gains to show for it except destruction.\"\n\nInfante Enrique added: \"It's also very different from siege warfare. We're becoming raiders, not conquerors. That changes the nature of the campaign.\"\n\nThe council fell silent, waiting for Juan's response. Several commanders were clearly intrigued by the idea, others more cautious. But no one had dismissed it as foolish—it was being treated as a serious strategic option.\n\nWhat does Juan think? Does he wish to pursue this raiding strategy, or consider other options?"

Then reactions erupted nearly simultaneously.\n\nInfante Enrique broke into a fierce grin. \"By God, Your Majesty. March to Granada's gates with the crusade banner and demand their surrender. That's...\" He laughed, almost in disbelief. \"That's magnificent. Even if the Sultan refuses—especially if he refuses—the story will echo across Christendom and through every corner of Granada.\"\n\nThe Master of Calatrava's expression was more complex—approval mixed with concern. \"Your Majesty, the boldness is admirable. But let me ensure I understand the full strategy.\"\n\nHe stood, pacing as he thought aloud. \"We march ten thousand troops to Granada city—a two-day march. We present ourselves before their walls with the papal banner, the True Cross if you wish to carry it, and demand Sultan Muhammad's surrender of the entire emirate. He will refuse—we should assume that with near certainty. We then withdraw, devastating the countryside systematically on our return—agriculture, infrastructure, military capacity. We arrive back at Alcalá having made a statement and caused real economic damage.\"\n\n\"Then we pivot. Rather than another major siege without artillery, we methodically reduce smaller targets—villages, minor fortified positions—all close to our supply lines where we can operate sustainably. We wait for the bombards to be ready, monitor what develops with the western army, and when conditions are right, we strike another major fortress with proper artillery support.\"\n\nHe looked at Juan directly. \"Is that the strategy, Your Majesty?\"\n\nAt Juan's confirmation, the Master nodded slowly. \"It's... actually quite sound, strategically. The dramatic gesture serves multiple purposes—propaganda, humiliation of the enemy, demonstration of dominance. The countryside devastation has real military value. And the pivot to sustainable operations while waiting for artillery addresses exactly what went wrong at Íllora.\"\n\nDon Rodrigo de Perea spoke up. \"The demand for surrender at their gates, Your Majesty—even knowing it will be refused—that's powerful symbolism. We're not raiders sneaking through their territory. We're crusaders marching openly to their capital and offering terms. When refused, the devastation we inflict is justified by their intransigence.\"\n\nCaptain Fernán added thoughtfully: \"And the men will understand this, Your Majesty. It's not aimless raiding—it's a formal military action. Offer terms, get refused, prosecute the campaign accordingly. That has logic and honor to it.\"\n\nConcerns Raised:\n\nDon García López de Padilla raised his hand cautiously. \"Your Majesty, one tactical concern. When we present ourselves at Granada's walls, we're within range of their artillery and archers. A force of ten thousand can't be kept safely out of range while making formal demands. We'll be exposed.\"\n\nInfante Enrique waved dismissively. \"We position properly—close enough to make the demand credible, far enough that we're not presenting targets for sustained bombardment. This is frontier warfare; we know how to approach hostile fortifications without being slaughtered.\"\n\nThe Master added: \"And frankly, if the Sultan opens fire on a formal embassy approaching his walls, that tells us something about his character and makes our subsequent devastation even more justified in the eyes of Christendom.\"\n\nAnother commander, one of the Calatrava captains, spoke: \"The countryside devastation, Your Majesty—how systematic do you envision? Are we targeting specific economic infrastructure, or is this total destruction of everything we encounter?\"\n\nBefore Juan could answer, Infante Enrique interjected: \"We're crusaders, not butchers. Military targets, economic infrastructure, supply depots—yes. Systematic murder of peasants or destruction of churches and religious sites—no. We devastate their capacity to make war, not commit atrocities that would turn even Christian kingdoms against us.\"\n\nThe Master nodded agreement. \"Agreed. We maintain the moral authority of the crusade while still causing real damage.\"\n\nLogistics and Timeline:\n\nThe Master returned to practical matters. \"For this to work, we need perhaps three days to organize the raid force properly. Select the right troops, organize supplies for two weeks, ensure the garrison remaining at Alcalá is positioned correctly.\"\n\n\"The march itself: two days to Granada, one day for the formal demand and their refusal, four to five days of systematic devastation on the withdrawal, two days back to Alcalá. Call it ten days to two weeks total.\"\n\n\"The bombards—Master Pietro's last estimate was they'd be operational in the next few days. By the time we return from this raid, they should be fully ready. We can then reassess based on what we learn during the raid and any news from the western front.\"\n\nDon Rodrigo added: \"The raid will also generate intelligence, Your Majesty. We'll see Granada's defenses firsthand, observe their reaction time, understand their military capability better than any scouts can tell us.\"\n\nThe Vote:\n\nThe Master of Calatrava looked around the council table. \"Your Majesty has proposed a strategy. Does this council support it?\"\n\nInfante Enrique spoke immediately. \"Absolutely. It's bold, it's aggressive, and it maintains initiative. I support it fully.\"\n\nDon García López de Padilla: \"The risks are real, but manageable. The potential gains—both practical and symbolic—justify them. I support it.\"\n\nDon Rodrigo de Perea: \"The intelligence value alone makes it worthwhile. I support it.\"\n\nCaptain Fernán: \"I'll follow Your Majesty wherever you lead. If you're marching to Granada's gates, I'm with you.\"\n\nOne by one, the commanders voiced support. Some enthusiastically, some cautiously, but none opposed. The strategy combined boldness with practicality in a way that appealed to their frontier warrior sensibilities.\n\nThe Master of Calatrava stood formally. \"Your Majesty, this council supports your strategy. We will organize the raid force immediately. In three days, we march toward Granada.\"\n\nHe paused, then added with something approaching admiration: \"Your father would have been proud of this, Your Majesty. Bold enough to be remembered, cautious enough to succeed. That's the balance of good generalship.\"\n\nInfante Enrique raised his cup. \"To the gates of Granada, and to the Sultan's refusal that will justify everything we do after.\"\n\nThe council joined the toast, the tension of the past weeks finally breaking into purposeful determination.\n\nWhat are Juan's orders for the three days of preparation before the march?"

He's proven himself reliable and Juan is showing trust in him by leaving him in command of nearly 10,000 troops.\n\nI should show Enrique's reaction, then have the Master of Calatrava begin organizing the practical details of the raid force composition and preparation timeline.\n\nInfante Enrique's expression flickered—a moment of disappointment quickly mastered.

No heavy equipment, no siege train, nothing that slows us down.\"\n\nDay Two - Preparation:\n\"Drills and briefings. Every unit commander needs to understand the mission: march to Granada, formal demand for surrender, systematic devastation on withdrawal if refused. Make sure the men know this isn't a conquest—it's a statement and a strike at their capacity.\"\n\n\"Finalize the march order. Advance cavalry, main body, rearguard. Screening forces on the flanks. We move as a professional army, not a mob.\"\n\nDay Three - Final Readiness:\n\"Equipment inspection. Final supply checks. Rest the men fully—they march at dawn on the fourth day. Brief the garrison staying at Alcalá on their defensive responsibilities.\"\n\nThe Master looked at Juan. \"Your Majesty, a few questions for clarity:\"\n\n\"First, the crusade banner and sacred relics. Do you wish to carry the True Cross relic again, or just the banner? The relic has enormous symbolic weight, but it's also a responsibility—if anything happened to it...\"\n\n\"Second, the formal demand at Granada's gates. Do you wish to compose that now, or will you speak extemporaneously when we arrive? A prepared statement ensures we say exactly what we want, but spontaneous words sometimes carry more power.\"\n\n\"Third, the devastation phase. Do you wish to give specific orders about what we target and what we spare, or leave tactical decisions to commanders in the field? Some guidance would help ensure we maintain discipline.\"\n\nDon García added: \"And Your Majesty, your personal escort during the approach to Granada's walls. When you're within range of their defenses making the demand, how many men do you want with you? Just your immediate household, or a larger force for security?\"\n\nThe council awaited Juan's guidance on these details."

          "text": "Juan is making clear decisions:\n1. Relics stay in Jaén (safe, but banner still carries symbolic weight)\n2. Economic targets - mills, supplies, fields - but spare civilians\n3. He'll speak spontaneously at Granada's gates\n\nThe commanders should react to this, particularly the last point about speaking spontaneously. Some might be concerned, others might trust him given his track record (Rome, Florence speech, etc.). The Master of Calatrava and others have seen Juan's boldness work before.\n\nI should have them react naturally, express any concerns, but ultimately accept his judgment. Then we can move to the three days of preparation and the march itself.\n\nThe Master of Calatrava nodded at the first two points, but paused at the third. He exchanged a glance with Captain Fernán, who gave a slight shrug—half concern, half acceptance.\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" the Master said carefully, \"spontaneous words at Granada's gates. That's... bold. Though I suppose boldness has served you well before.\" A slight smile. \"You stripped naked before Pope Martin and it worked. You gave that speech in Florence that set Italy ablaze. Perhaps I should trust your instincts.\"\n\nInfante Enrique laughed outright. \"God guide you when you stand before the gates—I like that. The Sultan will be expecting formal diplomatic language, carefully prepared demands. Instead he gets a crusader king speaking from the heart. That might be more effective than any prepared statement.\"\n\nCaptain Fernán spoke quietly. \"Your Majesty has a gift for these moments. I've seen it. The speech to the guards in Valladolid, the crowd in Florence, the way you spoke to the troops when we arrived here. When the moment comes, you find the words.\" He paused. \"Though I'll pray for you nonetheless.\"\n\nDon Rodrigo added practically: \"Economic targets—mills, supplies, fields. That's clear guidance, Your Majesty. The men will understand. We devastate their capacity to feed and supply an army while sparing the civilian population from direct harm. It maintains the moral authority of the crusade.\"\n\nThe Master stood formally. \"Then we have our orders, Your Majesty. The relics remain safely in Jaén. We carry the banner to Granada's gates. You will speak as God guides you. We devastate their economic infrastructure systematically on our withdrawal. We depart in three days at dawn.\"\n\nHe looked around the council. \"Gentlemen, dismissed to your duties. We have seventy-two hours to prepare ten thousand troops for the boldest operation of this campaign. Let's not waste time.\"\n\nThe commanders rose, bowing to Juan before filing out to begin the frantic work of organization. Soon only the Master, Infante Enrique, and Captain Fernán remained.\n\nInfante Enrique clasped Juan's shoulder briefly—a gesture that would have been presumptuous from most, but the Infante had earned a certain familiarity. \"Your Majesty, I meant what I said. This is history. When they write about this crusade, they'll remember the day King Juan II rode to Granada's gates and demanded their surrender. Make it count.\"\n\nHe departed, leaving the Master and Captain Fernán.\n\nThe Master spoke quietly. \"Your Majesty, I've commanded men for two decades. I've seen bold plans and cautious plans, brilliant ideas and foolish ones. This...\" He gestured vaguely. \"This could be any of those, depending on what happens. But I'll tell you this: the men believe in you. After what you did on the march here, after these two weeks of your presence, they'll follow you to Granada's gates and beyond. That's worth more than any amount of tactical planning.\"\n\nHe bowed and left to begin preparations.\n\nCaptain Fernán remained a moment longer. \"Your Majesty, I should check on your personal equipment and ensure your household is ready. But before I go—are you certain about speaking spontaneously at the gates? I'm not questioning your ability, just... wanting to be sure you've thought through the weight of that moment.\"\n\nThe Next Three Days - Alcalá la Real, May 5-7, 1431\n\nThe fortress and camp transformed into controlled chaos. Ten thousand men being selected, organized, supplied, and prepared for a deep raid required extraordinary coordination.\n\nDay One saw unit selections and fierce competition among troops to be included. Men who'd felt defeated at Íllora now desperately wanted to be part of the Granada raid. The Master's officers chose carefully—the fittest, most experienced, most disciplined troops.\n\nDay Two brought endless drills and briefings. March formations practiced. Supply distribution organized. Every man receiving clear instructions about the mission's purpose and rules of engagement.\n\nDay Three arrived with a sense of anticipation. Final inspections, equipment checks, and—notably—religious observances. Fray Hernando was in Rome, but other clergy blessed the troops and led prayers. The men understood they were about to do something unprecedented.\n\nDawn, May 8, 1431 - The March Begins\n\nTen thousand troops assembled in the pre-dawn darkness outside Alcalá's walls. The crusade banner—brilliant white with its mounted cross—stood prominently at the column's head. Juan sat mounted before his army, the Master of Calatrava beside him.\n\nBehind them: six thousand infantry in disciplined formation, four thousand cavalry ready for mobile operations, supply trains kept to absolute minimum.\n\nInfante Enrique stood on the fortress walls, watching. He raised his hand in salute as Juan looked up toward him.\n\nThe Master turned to Juan. \"Your Majesty, the army is ready. We march to Granada.\"\n\nJuan gave the order.\n\nThe column moved out, heading southwest toward the heart of the Emirate of Granada. Two days to the capital. Then history would be made at those gates.\n\nWhat does Juan do or think about during the two-day march to Granada?"

          "text": "Then I need to draft a d100 table for how Sultan Muhammad IX responds to the news that a 10,000-man Castilian army is marching toward Granada city.\n\nLet me think about the Sultan's situation:\n- His main army won't be ready until June/July (still assembling)\n- He has perhaps 3,000-4,000 troops scattered in fortresses\n- Maybe 1,000-2,000 mobile reserves available\n- Moroccan reinforcements arriving but timeline unclear\n- He just \"won\" at Íllora by forcing Castilian withdrawal\n- His court is likely divided on strategy\n- Economic situation strained\n- Morale complicated - victory at Íllora but overall losing the war\n\nWhat are his realistic options?\n1. Try to assemble forces quickly to meet the Castilians in field\n2. Pull all forces inside Granada city and defend\n3. Harass with guerrillas while avoiding battle\n4. Try diplomatic approach (unlikely given crusade context)\n5. Panic and make poor decisions\n6. Calculated defensive response\n7. Aggressive counterattack attempt\n8. Some combination\n\nThe Sultan is young (the previous chapters mentioned he's young and was traumatized by Alcalá). His court is divided. He has military commanders who want offense, religious leaders counseling defense, merchants suffering economically.\n\nMost realistic: He won't have time or forces to assemble a major field army. He'll probably concentrate on defending Granada city and using whatever mobile forces he has for harassment. The question is how well he manages this and whether he makes any bold/desperate moves.\n\nLet me draft the table:\n\nBefore Departure\n\nJuan found Infante Enrique on the fortress walls one final time before mounting up. The Infante was watching the army assemble, his expression still showing that conflict between duty and desire.\n\n\"Enrique,\" Juan said, approaching. \"I need you to understand something. I need you here at this moment—not as punishment or because I doubt you, but because this is where you're most valuable. Someone I trust completely must hold Alcalá and be ready to respond if things go wrong.\"\n\nHe clasped Enrique's shoulder. \"And I will not deny you your second chance for glory. You were pivotal in our first major battle—you commanded the siege works at Alcalá while I was with the field army. Your moment will come again. This campaign has months left in it, and I will need you when it matters most.\"\n\nEnrique's expression softened. He gripped Juan's forearm in return. \"Thank you, Your Majesty. That... means more than you know. I'll hold Alcalá. And when you need me in the field again, I'll be ready.\"\n\n\"I know you will be,\" Juan said. Then he descended to his waiting army.\n\nThe March to Granada - May 8-9, 1431\n\nJuan wore his full armor throughout the march—polished steel covered by the white crusader's tabard. The white banners bearing the red cross were attached prominently to his saddle, visible from distance. He rode at the column's head with the Master of Calatrava, making himself unmistakably present.\n\nThe cavalry screen spread out efficiently—four thousand horsemen providing reconnaissance and flank protection. Advance scouts ranged miles ahead, ensuring no ambushes awaited. The main body of six thousand infantry marched in disciplined formation, their white crusader crosses visible on surcoats and shields.\n\nThis was no raiding party trying to sneak through—this was an army marching openly through enemy territory, daring anyone to challenge it.\n\nBy the afternoon of the first day, Moorish scouts had certainly spotted them. Small groups of riders appeared on distant ridges, watching, then galloping away to carry word. Juan's cavalry drove some off, but made no serious effort to prevent the intelligence from reaching Granada—the whole point was for the Sultan to know what was coming.\n\nThe column covered good ground—twenty miles the first day, camping in defensive formation overnight. Pickets reported distant observation but no attacks. The guerrilla bands that plagued smaller forces wisely avoided engaging ten thousand troops.\n\nThe second day's march brought them deeper into Granada's heartland. The fertile Vega came into view—the agricultural plains that fed the emirate. Prosperous-looking villages dotted the landscape, though many showed signs of hasty abandonment as word of the approaching Castilian army spread.\n\nBy late afternoon of May 9th, Granada city itself appeared on the horizon. The red walls of the Alhambra palace-fortress complex visible on its hill, the city sprawling below, minarets rising above the buildings. It was magnificent—the jewel of Moorish Iberia.\n\nAnd it was about to receive a Castilian army at its gates.\n\nSultan Muhammad IX's Response - D100 Table\n\nLet me evaluate what the Sultan can realistically do (early May 1431, given 24-48 hours warning of approach):\n\nSultan's Situation:\n\nYoung (early 20s), traumatized by Alcalá defeat\n\nMain army not ready until June/July (still 6-8 weeks away)\n\nPerhaps 3,000-4,000 troops in scattered fortresses\n\nMaybe 1,000-2,000 mobile forces available immediately\n\nCourt divided: military commanders want aggression, religious leaders counsel defense, merchants fear economic ruin\n\nRecent \"victory\" at Íllora provides some morale boost\n\nBut overall losing the war strategically\n\nGranada city itself well-fortified with perhaps 1,500-2,000 garrison\n\nRealistic Options:\n\nPull forces inside city and defend\n\nUse mobile forces for harassment\n\nAttempt to assemble quick reaction force\n\nMake desperate diplomatic overture\n\nPanic and poor decisions\n\nCalculated defensive response\n\nSome bold/risky move\n\nMost likely: defensive consolidation with some harassment, but significant variance based on Sultan's competence and court dynamics.\n\nD100 Table: Sultan Muhammad IX's Response to Castilian March\n\n1-5: Complete Panic/Disaster\nSultan and court paralyzed by fear. Chaotic, contradictory orders issued. Forces pulled from nearby fortresses haphazardly, creating confusion. Some commanders refuse orders, others overreact. Civilian population panics, some flee the city. No coherent defensive plan. Granada city defenses undermanned or poorly organized. Court infighting becomes open as various factions blame each other. Complete strategic failure—worst possible response.\n\n6-12: Severe Mismanagement\nSultan attempts to assemble field force to meet Castilians but executes poorly. Pulls 1,500-2,000 troops from fortresses, assembles them hastily outside Granada. Force inadequate and poorly positioned—could be destroyed if attacked. Leaves fortresses weakened and mobile force vulnerable. Court divided, conflicting orders. City defenses somewhat neglected. Poor intelligence about Castilian intentions. Risky position that could lead to disaster.\n\n13-25: Poor Response\nSultan pulls all available forces inside Granada city (2,000-2,500 total), abandoning outlying positions. Purely defensive posture with no attempt at harassment or maneuver. Court openly divided—some wanting negotiation, others wanting aggression, Sultan unable to impose coherent strategy. Morale among defenders shaky. Missed opportunities to use mobile forces effectively. Adequate defense of city itself but strategic passivity.\n\n26-45: Adequate Defensive Response\nSultan consolidates defenses sensibly. Pulls 1,000-1,500 troops into Granada city, leaves fortress garrisons intact. Organizes city defenses properly—walls manned, supplies secured, civilians calmed. Sends mobile forces (500-800 cavalry) to harass Castilian flanks and supply lines but avoids direct engagement. Court tension controlled. Competent but unimaginative response—defends what he has, doesn't take risks.\n\n46-65: Solid Defensive Strategy\nSultan executes good defensive plan. Granada city strongly garrisoned (2,000+ troops), defenses well-organized, morale maintained. Mobile harassment forces (800-1,200) positioned to strike opportunistically without risking defeat. Fortress garrisons maintain position, creating defensive network. Court mostly unified around defensive strategy. Good intelligence gathering about Castilian movements. Competent response that makes best of difficult situation. Small chance of diplomatic overture.\n\n66-80: Strong Response with Initiative\nSultan responds decisively and intelligently. Granada city heavily defended, mobile forces (1,200-1,500) actively harassing Castilians during march. Coordinates with fortress commanders—when Castilians withdraw, they'll face coordinated harassment from multiple directions. Court unified behind Sultan's leadership. Perhaps sends diplomatic message (not surrender, but probing intentions). Good intelligence and counter-intelligence. Possibly prepares surprise—night raid on Castilian camp, or ambush during withdrawal. Competent, aggressive defense.\n\n81-92: Excellent Strategic Response\nSultan demonstrates unexpected competence. Granada defended expertly, mobile forces positioned brilliantly for maximum harassment with minimum risk. Coordinates comprehensive defensive network. Court unified and morale high despite circumstances. Possibly springs tactical surprise—elite force positioned to strike Castilians at vulnerable moment. Or: sends high-value diplomatic envoy (not to surrender, but to negotiate, buy time, or gather intelligence). Intelligence operations effective—knows Castilian intentions and plans accordingly. Makes best possible use of limited resources.\n\n93-100: Masterful Response/Unexpected Development\nSultan (or brilliant advisor) executes masterful strategy that turns tables. Possible scenarios: (1) Assembled larger force than expected—pulls troops from everywhere, fields 3,000-4,000 in coordinated defense; (2) Springs elaborate trap—lets Castilians approach, then ambushes with hidden forces and sortie from city; (3) Sends high-ranking diplomat (possibly the Sultan's own brother or vizier) to parley—creates political/diplomatic complications; (4) Has pre-positioned major Moroccan reinforcement that arrives exactly now; (5) Uses intelligence to prepare devastating counter-surprise. Whatever happens, Sultan seizes initiative in unexpected way that creates real complications for Juan's plan.\n\nReady for you to roll to determine Sultan Muhammad IX's response."

This table determines what specific challenge the Castilian army faces:\n\nD100 Table: Nature of Sultan's Excellent Response\n\n1-8: Elaborate Ambush/Trap\nSultan has prepared sophisticated ambush using terrain near Granada. Hidden force of 1,500-2,000 troops positioned to strike Castilian column at vulnerable point (river crossing, narrow pass, etc.). Combine sortie from city with ambush from concealed position. Requires tactical response to avoid or fight through. Casualties likely if not handled well. Shows Sultan learned from Alcalá and is taking risks.\n\n9-18: Devastating Night Raid\nElite Moorish force (300-500 raiders) conducts sophisticated night attack on Castilian camp during approach. Target: supplies, command tents, create chaos. Well-planned, executed by best troops. Could cause significant disruption, casualties, and force defensive posture. Shows Sultan willing to take offensive action despite overall weakness.\n\n19-30: Coordinated Harassment Network\nMobile forces (1,200-1,500) positioned brilliantly along approach and around Granada. Constant harassment from multiple directions—never decisive engagement, but bleeding casualties continuously. Combined with fortress coordination means Castilians under pressure from all sides. Professional, disciplined harassment that maximizes Granada's mobile advantage. Makes approach costly and withdrawal dangerous.\n\n31-45: High-Value Diplomatic Envoy\nSultan sends senior diplomatic mission to intercept Castilians before reaching Granada. Either: (1) Sultan's brother/close relative, (2) Grand Vizier, or (3) respected religious figure. Not offering surrender, but requesting formal parley. Creates diplomatic/political complications—refusing to meet might look bad, meeting gives Sultan time and intelligence. Possibly offering terms (tribute, prisoner exchange, ceasefire) that complicate crusade narrative.\n\n46-58: Propaganda and Psychological Operation\nSultan stages elaborate show of force and confidence. When Castilians arrive at gates, find city heavily defended, population visibly defiant (not cowering), defenders performing military displays. Possibly captive Castilian soldiers displayed on walls (from Íllora or raids). Proclamations about Granada's strength, Allah's favor, inevitable Castilian defeat. Professional psychological warfare to undermine Juan's dramatic gesture and boost Moorish morale.\n\n59-70: Intelligence Advantage - Sultan Knows the Plan\nThrough spies, captured scouts, or brilliant deduction, Sultan knows exactly what Juan intends: demand surrender, get refused, devastate countryside. Has prepared accordingly. When demand comes, Sultan's response is perfectly calibrated to undermine it. Possibly has counter-offer prepared, or has already evacuated/fortified economic assets, or has prepared to turn Juan's devastation into propaganda victory (\"crusaders burning innocent Muslims' homes\"). Intelligence advantage creates complications Juan didn't anticipate.\n\n71-82: Unexpected Military Reinforcement\nMoroccan contingent (800-1,200 troops) arrived earlier than expected, or Sultan pulled more forces from distant fortresses than intelligence suggested. Granada has 3,000-3,500 troops in city, not 2,000. Not enough to defeat Castilians in field, but enough to sortie aggressively during approach or withdrawal. Makes operation more dangerous than anticipated. Possibly positioned for ambush during Castilian withdrawal phase.\n\n83-92: Combined Challenge - Envoy Plus Trap\nSultan executes sophisticated dual approach. Sends high-ranking envoy (his brother or vizier) to request parley and buy time. While diplomatic mission proceeds, positions military forces (1,500-2,000) for potential ambush or harassment during withdrawal. If Juan refuses envoy, looks unreasonable. If Juan meets envoy, gives Sultan time to position forces. If Juan proceeds with devastation after diplomatic contact, faces better-prepared resistance. Brilliant tactical and political positioning.\n\n93-100: Masterful Multi-Layered Response\nSultan executes comprehensive strategy combining multiple elements: (1) High-value diplomatic envoy creates political complications, (2) Hidden military forces positioned for devastating surprise, (3) Propaganda operation undermines Juan's gesture, (4) Intelligence advantage means Granada prepared for every move, (5) Coordinated defensive network ready for withdrawal phase. Juan faces multiple simultaneous challenges requiring careful navigation. Sultan has turned defensive crisis into opportunity to demonstrate competence and possibly inflict real damage.\n\nThis table determines what specific manifestation of the Sultan's excellent response Juan encounters. The 31-82 range represents serious but manageable complications; the extremes involve either focused tactical threats or sophisticated combined challenges.\n\nReady for you to roll."

          "text": "The Sultan has the troops but still can't defeat 10,000 Castilians in open battle. So his options are:\n1. Keep them all inside city walls - purely defensive\n2. Position some outside for ambush during approach\n3. Use mobile force to harass constantly\n4. Plan sortie during the demand/parley moment\n5. Position force to ambush during withdrawal\n6. Some combination\n\nI need to be very specific about:\n- Where the forces are positioned\n- What their exact plan is\n- When they'll execute it\n- What they're trying to achieve\n- Numbers involved in each element\n\nLet me create a table with specific, actionable scenarios that require no follow-up.\n\nSultan's Tactical Plan with 3,000-3,500 Troops - D100 Table\n\nThis table determines the Sultan's specific tactical deployment and plan with his unexpectedly large force:\n\n1-8: Passive Defense - All Forces Inside City\nAll 3,000-3,500 troops are inside Granada's walls in purely defensive posture. No ambush, no sortie, no harassment. Sultan positioning for siege defense but won't take offensive action. When Juan arrives and makes demand, Sultan refuses from safety of walls. Castilians face heavily defended city but no active military threat. Can devastate countryside unopposed but achieve no military engagement. Sultan playing it completely safe.\n\n9-18: Pure Harassment Strategy\n1,200-1,500 mobile cavalry positioned in 3-4 groups around Granada's approaches. Remaining 2,000+ inside city. Plan: harass Castilian column constantly during approach—hit supply elements, stragglers, isolated units. Never commit to battle. When Castilians reach gates, cavalry withdraws. During demand ceremony, harassment pauses. When Castilians begin devastation phase, harassment resumes aggressively. Goal: bleed Castilians continuously without risking decisive defeat. No ambush or sortie, just professional mobile warfare.\n\n19-30: Hidden Ambush Near City\nSultan has positioned 1,500-1,800 troops in concealed position 2-3 miles from Granada (wooded area, reverse slope, buildings). Remaining forces defend city. Plan: let Castilians approach city and make their demand. After refusal, when Castilians begin withdrawing and spreading out for devastation, hidden force strikes at vulnerable moment—hitting dispersed units or supply train. One decisive blow, then withdraw to city before Castilians can concentrate. High risk but potentially high reward.\n\n31-45: Sortie During Demand Ceremony\nAll 3,000-3,500 troops positioned inside city, but gates positioned for rapid sortie. Plan: when Juan approaches gates with his escort to make formal demand (vulnerable moment, small escort, within range of walls), Sultan launches major sortie—2,000+ troops pour out to either capture/kill Juan or at minimum disrupt ceremony and inflict casualties. Extremely aggressive, high-risk move. If successful, could kill/capture the king. If unsuccessful, sortie force caught outside walls by 10,000 Castilians.\n\n46-58: Defensive Sortie During Withdrawal\nAll forces inside city during Castilian approach. Sultan refuses demand from walls. Waits while Castilians begin countryside devastation. Once Castilian army is dispersed across countryside destroying infrastructure (units separated, focused on destruction not combat), Sultan launches coordinated sortie of 2,500-3,000 troops targeting dispersed units. Hit them when scattered and busy, inflict maximum casualties, withdraw before they concentrate. Calculated aggression at optimal moment.\n\n59-70: Two-Pronged Defense\n1,500 cavalry positioned outside city for mobile harassment. 2,000 troops inside city. Plan: cavalry harasses Castilians during approach (constant pressure, no decisive engagement). When Castilians reach gates for demand, cavalry withdraws. Sultan refuses from walls. During devastation phase, city garrison launches limited sortie (800-1,000 troops) while cavalry resumes harassment—pincer attack on dispersed devastation units. Coordinated two-element defense maximizing both mobile and garrison forces.\n\n61-78: Ambush During Withdrawal March\nAll 3,000-3,500 troops inside city during approach and demand. Sultan refuses formally. Waits while Castilians devastate countryside for 1-2 days. Then: as Castilians begin march back to Alcalá (column formation, loaded with loot, possibly less alert after unopposed devastation), Sultan launches major pursuit with 2,500-3,000 troops. Not attacking city itself but hitting column during withdrawal march. Combined with fortress harassment from Moclín/Montefrío, creates dangerous gauntlet. Attacking when Castilians psychologically relaxing after successful devastation.\n\n79-88: Coordinated Network Defense\nSultan deploys forces in sophisticated multi-element network: (1) 800-1,000 mobile cavalry harassing during approach, (2) 1,500 troops inside city ready for opportunity sortie, (3) 700-1,000 troops pre-positioned at fortress between Granada and Alcalá (probably Moclín) to hit Castilians during withdrawal. No single decisive engagement, but coordinated pressure from multiple directions throughout operation. When demand is made, cavalry harassment pauses but resumes during devastation. City sortie targets vulnerable moment during devastation. Fortress ambush hits withdrawal march. Comprehensive defensive plan maximizing all assets.\n\n89-95: Aggressive Ambush at Optimal Moment\nSultan has studied Castilian operations and identified optimal ambush point: narrow valley or river crossing 5-8 miles from Granada on approach route. Positioned 2,200-2,500 troops in elaborate concealed ambush combining terrain advantage, prepared positions, and element of surprise. Remaining forces defend city. Plan: let Castilian vanguard pass, then hit main body in kill zone with overwhelming local superiority before they can deploy. One massive, well-planned blow. Then rapid withdrawal to city. If successful, could inflict 300-800 Castilian casualties. If detected or countered, Sultan's field force could be destroyed.\n\n96-100: Desperate All-Out Sortie\nSultan makes extremely bold/reckless decision: when Castilians approach to make demand, launches all-out sortie with nearly entire garrison (3,000+ troops). Not just disrupting ceremony but attempting to defeat Castilian army in field battle by catching them unprepared during approach to city. Commits everything to one decisive engagement. Either: (1) catches Castilians by complete surprise and inflicts major defeat, or (2) Sultan's army destroyed in open battle by superior Castilian force. Extremely high risk, potentially war-deciding either way. Suggests Sultan either brilliant and sees unique opportunity, or desperate/irrational.\n\nEach outcome provides specific, unambiguous tactical plan requiring no follow-up table. The numbers, positioning, timing, and intent are all clearly defined.\n\nReady for you to roll."

          "text": "Wait, the user says \"I rolled 41; Sortie During Demand Ceremony\" but 41 falls in the 31-45 range, which is actually:\n\n**31-45: Sortie During Demand Ceremony**\nAll 3,000-3,500 troops positioned inside city, but gates positioned for rapid sortie. Plan: when Juan approaches gates with his escort to make formal demand (vulnerable moment, small escort, within range of walls), Sultan launches major sortie—2,000+ troops pour out to either capture/kill Juan or at minimum disrupt ceremony and inflict casualties. Extremely aggressive, high-risk move. If successful, could kill/capture the king. If unsuccessful, sortie force caught outside walls by 10,000 Castilians.\n\nSo the user is correct - 41 is \"Sortie During Demand Ceremony\", not \"Defensive Sortie During Withdrawal\". The Sultan's plan is to wait until Juan approaches the gates with a small escort to make his formal demand, then launch a massive sortie attempting to capture or kill the king.\n\nThis is extremely dangerous for Juan. He'll be in a vulnerable position with a small escort when 2,000+ troops suddenly pour out of the gates.\n\nNow the user wants me to describe what happens until the army reaches Granada, keeping this (unknown to Juan) plan in mind.\n\nI'll map out the approach, focusing on subtle tensions and preparations without revealing the hidden threat.\n\nThe Castilian army winds through rugged mountain passes, Granada's silhouette emerging gradually against the harsh Andalusian landscape. Juan rides at the column's head, scanning the terrain with calculated precision. Scouts report minimal resistance, but an underlying unease permeates the ranks. The city's walls seem both invitation and warning - pristine, yet charged with an almost palpable anticipation.\n\nAs they draw closer, small details catch Juan's attention: unusually positioned sentries, gates that appear subtly reinforced, a strange readiness in the city's defensive posture. Something feels different, but nothing concrete suggests immediate danger.\n\nThe Final Approach to Granada - May 9, 1431, Late Afternoon\n\nThe two-day march proceeded with remarkable smoothness. The Castilian cavalry screen encountered only distant Moorish scouts—watching, reporting, but never engaging. No ambushes materialized. No significant harassment. It was almost eerie how unopposed the advance was.\n\n\"They're letting us come,\" the Master of Calatrava observed on the second day. \"Either they have nothing to stop us with, or they're preparing something inside the city.\"\n\nBy late afternoon of May 9th, the army crested the final ridge and Granada lay before them in the valley below.\n\nThe sight was breathtaking even to men who'd seen it before. The Alhambra complex dominated the heights—red walls glowing in the late sun, towers and palaces rising behind the fortifications. Below sprawled the city itself: white buildings, winding streets, minarets, the shimmer of fountains and gardens. The Vega stretched around it—fertile plains dotted with villages and farms.\n\nThis was the jewel they'd come to claim.\n\nThe army descended into the Vega, moving toward the city in full battle array. The white crusader banners streamed prominently. Juan rode at the head in his white-painted armor and tabard, making himself unmistakable.\n\nAs they drew closer—within two miles of the city walls—details became clearer. Granada's defenses were formidable: high stone walls, strong towers, multiple gates. The walls were clearly manned—Juan could see the glint of armor and weapons, banners flying from the towers. The city was alert and ready.\n\nBut what struck the experienced commanders was the sheer number of defenders visible. \"Your Majesty,\" Don García López de Padilla said quietly, riding up beside Juan. \"Those walls are heavily manned. More than I'd expect for a city caught by surprise. See the density of troops along the western wall facing us?\"\n\nThe Master of Calatrava nodded grimly. \"Intelligence said maybe two thousand garrison. I'm seeing... more. Significantly more. The Sultan pulled forces from somewhere.\"\n\nThe Castilian army deployed in the fields about a mile from Granada's western gate—the main entrance facing their approach. Ten thousand troops in battle formation, cavalry on the flanks, infantry in the center. The crusade banner flew prominently at the center.\n\nFrom the city walls, thousands of Moorish soldiers watched. The gates were closed, but Juan noticed something: the main western gate's positioning seemed... prepared. Not barred and sealed for siege, but ready. Troops were concentrated heavily around it.\n\nAs sunset approached, the Castilian army established a defensive camp. No attempt to assault or invest the city—that wasn't the mission. Tomorrow morning, Juan would approach the gate under flag of truce and make his demand.\n\nThat night, the camp was quiet but tense. Pickets reported no hostile activity, but the city remained clearly alert. Lights blazed along the walls. The sound of activity drifted across the dark fields—preparation of some kind, though for what, the Castilians couldn't determine.\n\nCaptain Fernán found Juan after evening prayers. \"Your Majesty, about tomorrow. When you approach the gate to make your demand—how large an escort do you want? Just your immediate household, or something more substantial?\"\n\nThe Master of Calatrava joined the conversation. \"I recommend at least two hundred cavalry, Your Majesty. You'll be within arrow range of those walls, possibly within range of artillery. A small escort is traditional for parley, but this is a king approaching an enemy capital. Some protection is warranted.\"\n\nDon García added: \"And frankly, Your Majesty, after seeing how heavily those walls are manned, I don't trust their intentions. The Sultan might respect truce customs, or he might see an opportunity.\"\n\nThe commanders awaited Juan's decision on how he would approach Granada's gates in the morning.\n\nWhat size escort does Juan want, and what precautions does he take for the demand ceremony?"

This is a major operation requiring:\n- Troops massed behind gates\n- Coordination and timing\n- Officers positioned to lead sortie\n- Possibly artillery positioned to support\n- Quick-opening of gates\n\nSome of this would be detectable to experienced observers, some wouldn't.\n\n**Realistic Assessment:**\nThe Castilians should have some suspicion - the heavily manned walls, the gate positioning, the unopposed approach. But detecting a specific plan to violate truce and sortie is harder. Most likely outcome: general wariness and suspicion without specific knowledge.\n\nLet me create a table:\n\nSuspicion of Sultan's Sortie Plan - D100 Table\n\nThis table determines how much Juan and his commanders suspect the Sultan might attack during the demand ceremony, based on observable indicators and military intuition.\n\nFactors Favoring Detection:\n\nExperienced frontier commanders familiar with Moorish tactics\n\nCan observe troop concentrations and positioning on walls\n\nGates appear unusually \"ready\" rather than sealed for siege\n\nHeavy concentration around western gate specifically\n\nTwo days of unopposed approach suggests preparation\n\nNight sounds of unusual activity in city\n\nProfessional soldiers' combat instincts\n\nCan see command staff movements\n\nFactors Against Detection:\n\nNo spies inside city providing intelligence\n\nHeavy garrison could be justified as defensive response to 10,000 troops\n\nGate readiness could be for defensive sortie if Castilians attack\n\nMoors skilled at operational security and deception\n\nCultural/language barriers limit intelligence\n\nSultan might maintain excellent security\n\nCould be misdirection\n\nD100 Table: Level of Suspicion About Sortie\n\n1-12: No Suspicion - Complete Surprise\nCommanders see nothing unusual. Heavy garrison seems normal defensive response. Gate positioning not remarked upon. Assume Sultan will respect parley customs as traditional. No special precautions recommended beyond basic security. If sortie happens, Castilians caught completely off-guard. Juan would approach with minimal escort expecting safe parley.\n\n13-28: Minimal Awareness - Vague Unease\nSome commanders feel something is \"off\" but can't articulate what. Heavy garrison noted but not alarming. General frontier caution but no specific concerns about sortie. Recommend standard escort (100-150 cavalry) as normal precaution for king approaching enemy city. No special preparations against sortie. Would be badly surprised but not completely unprepared.\n\n29-48: General Wariness - Something Feels Wrong\nMultiple commanders express unease. Heavy garrison noted, gate positioning remarked upon, concentration around western gate observed. Can't identify specific threat but experienced instincts say be careful. Recommend larger escort (200-300 cavalry) and heightened alertness. Main army positioned ready to respond. Some discussion of possibility they might try something but no consensus on what. Moderately prepared for trouble.\n\n49-68: Strong Suspicion - Specific Concerns\nCommanders identify multiple indicators suggesting possible sortie: gate positioning, troop concentration patterns, unusual activity, command staff visible near gates. Can't confirm but multiple experienced officers independently voice concern about sortie during parley. Strong recommendation: substantial escort (300-500 cavalry), main army deployed in battle formation ready to respond, advance warning to troops about possible violation of truce. Prepared for sortie but not certain it's coming.\n\n69-83: High Confidence - Sortie Expected\nMultiple clear indicators observed: massive troop concentration directly behind western gate, officers positioned for command, gate mechanisms tested during night, artillery positioned to cover sortie. Commanders near-certain Sultan plans something aggressive, most likely sortie during parley. Strong consensus. Recommendations: large escort (500+ cavalry), main army in full combat readiness, possibly refuse to approach gate closely or demand Sultan meet in open field. Prepared and expecting trouble.\n\n84-94: Near-Certainty - Specific Intelligence\nOverwhelming evidence of sortie preparation: captured scout or deserter provides information, observable preparations unmistakable, possibly intercepted messenger. Commanders know with high confidence that Sultan plans major sortie when Juan approaches gates. Specific numbers and timing unclear but intent certain. Recommendation: either refuse to approach gates at all, or approach with overwhelming escort (1,000+ cavalry) and main army positioned for immediate battle. Can turn Sultan's trap into Castilian advantage.\n\n95-100: Perfect Intelligence - Complete Knowledge\nDefinitive intelligence about sortie plan—either captured high-value prisoner, intercepted detailed orders, or spy inside Granada. Know exactly: 2,000-3,000 troops massed behind gates, plan to sortie when Juan approaches, goal to kill/capture king or inflict major casualties. Know timing, numbers, commanders involved. Can prepare perfect counter: refuse ceremony, or deliberately spring trap with overwhelming force ready, or use knowledge to humiliate Sultan by exposing plan publicly. Complete intelligence advantage.\n\nThis table determines how much the Castilians suspect and therefore how they'll prepare for tomorrow's demand ceremony.\n\nReady for you to roll."

This means Juan and his commanders have strong, specific evidence that the Sultan plans a major sortie during the demand ceremony. The table suggests this could come from a captured scout/deserter or intercepted messenger.\n\nLet me create a scenario where this intelligence is obtained during the late afternoon/evening of May 9th, after they've made camp but before nightfall. This gives Juan time to react and plan.\n\nI should:\n1. Describe how the intelligence is obtained (capture of someone with information)\n2. Detail what they learn specifically about the sortie plan\n3. Show the commanders' reactions and initial assessment\n4. Stop before evening so Juan can decide how to respond\n\nThe intelligence should be specific but not necessarily complete - they know there's a sortie planned, approximate numbers (2,000-3,000), the general timing (during the demand ceremony), but maybe not every detail.\n\nGranada's Outskirts - May 9, 1431, Late Afternoon\n\nThe Castilian camp was still being established when the commotion erupted near the eastern picket line. Cavalry scouts had intercepted a small group of Moorish riders—five men, traveling fast from the direction of Moclín fortress toward Granada.\n\nWithin minutes, the prisoners were brought before the Master of Calatrava. Four were common soldiers who knew nothing. But the fifth man was different—better dressed, carrying sealed documents in a leather satchel, and importantly, he spoke some Castilian learned from frontier trading.\n\nThe Master sent for Juan immediately.\n\nBy the time Juan arrived at the command tent, the interrogation was already underway. Captain Fernán and Don García López de Padilla were present, along with two frontier captains who spoke Arabic.\n\nThe prisoner—a man perhaps thirty-five, clearly an officer or courier—sat bound but not mistreated. The sealed documents lay open on the table before them.\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" the Master said as Juan entered. \"This man is Muhammad ibn Tariq, a cavalry officer from Moclín's garrison. He was carrying orders from the fortress commander to the Sultan in Granada.\" He gestured to the documents. \"We've read them.\"\n\nJuan looked at the Arabic script, incomprehensible to him. \"What do they say?\"\n\nOne of the Arabic-speaking captains translated: \"It's a report to the Sultan confirming that Moclín's garrison commander has sent 400 cavalry as requested to reinforce Granada. They arrived yesterday evening, May 8th. The letter also acknowledges receipt of the Sultan's strategic orders regarding the Castilian army's arrival.\"\n\nThe Master picked up another document—this one appeared to be a copy or summary. \"This is more interesting, Your Majesty. It's either a copy of the Sultan's original orders, or ibn Tariq's personal notes about those orders. It outlines the defensive plan.\"\n\nHe read from the document: \"When the Christian king approaches the gates to make his demand, the Sultan will refuse from the walls. But immediately upon refusal—before the Christian king can withdraw to safety—the garrison will launch a major sortie. The western gate will open and approximately 2,500 to 3,000 troops will pour out.\"\n\nA heavy silence fell over the tent.\n\nDon García spoke first, his voice tight. \"They're planning to violate parley customs. To attack during a formal diplomatic approach.\"\n\nThe Master continued reading: \"The sortie force consists of: 1,200 regular infantry from the city garrison, 800 Moroccan infantry who arrived last month, 400 cavalry from Moclín—that's this man's unit—and approximately 500-700 additional cavalry from various sources. Total between 2,500 and 3,000 troops.\"\n\nHe looked up at Juan. \"The plan is to catch you and your escort within range of the walls, with the sortie force emerging at close range. Their goal is explicitly stated: 'Kill or capture the Christian king, or at minimum inflict heavy casualties on his guard to demonstrate Granada's strength.'\"\n\nCaptain Fernán's hand moved to his sword hilt unconsciously. \"They mean to murder Your Majesty under flag of truce. During a formal parley.\"\n\nThe prisoner spoke in halting Castilian. \"Not murder. War. Your king comes to demand our Sultan's surrender. This is act of war already. Sultan defends as he must.\"\n\nDon García struck the table. \"There are rules! Customs of parley that civilized men respect, Christian and Moor alike!\"\n\nThe prisoner shrugged as much as his bonds allowed. \"You march ten thousand troops to our gates. You plan to burn our fields if we refuse. Sultan sees no reason for courtesy.\"\n\nThe Master held up a hand for silence. \"The strategic question, Your Majesty, is what we do with this information. The prisoner confirms the documents are genuine—he was carrying them as Moclín's contribution to the coordination. He's given us additional details under interrogation.\"\n\nHe gestured to notes one of the captains had been taking. \"The sortie will launch immediately upon the Sultan's refusal—probably within seconds. The gates are pre-positioned to open rapidly. The sortie force is assembled in the streets behind the western gate right now, waiting. Officers have been briefed. The plan is for the Sultan or his vizier to shout the refusal from the walls, and that's the signal for the gates to open.\"\n\n\"Timing is everything for them,\" Don Rodrigo de Perea added. \"They need you close to the gates—within two to three hundred yards—to prevent you from escaping when they sortie. If you're too far away when the gates open, you can simply withdraw and they've revealed their hand for nothing.\"\n\nThe Master looked at Juan directly. \"Your Majesty, we now know with near-certainty that approaching those gates tomorrow morning as originally planned would result in you being attacked by three thousand troops while exposed with whatever escort you bring. Even with five hundred cavalry, that's a desperate fight at close range to the city walls.\"\n\nCaptain Fernán spoke quietly. \"They mean to kill you, Your Majesty. Or capture you. That's their plan—sacrifice the customs of parley to eliminate the crusade's leader in one bold stroke.\"\n\nThe tent fell silent as the full weight of the intelligence settled on everyone present.\n\nDon García broke the silence. \"The question is: what do we do now? We know their plan. We can turn this to our advantage, or we can avoid the trap entirely. But we must decide tonight.\"\n\nThe Master nodded. \"Several options, Your Majesty. First: we could refuse to approach the gates at all. Make our demand from a distance, or not make it at all. Simply begin the devastation phase immediately. Denies them their opportunity but also abandons the dramatic gesture you planned.\"\n\n\"Second: we could approach with overwhelming force—say, three thousand cavalry as escort, with the entire army deployed for immediate battle. When they sortie, we're ready to crush them. Turn their trap into our victory.\"\n\n\"Third: we could spring a counter-trap. Appear to approach as if unaware, but with forces secretly positioned to respond when they sortie. Let them think they're surprising us, then destroy them when they're committed and exposed.\"\n\nDon Rodrigo added: \"Or fourth: we could use this intelligence diplomatically. Publicly expose their plan to violate parley customs. Humiliate the Sultan before even approaching the gates. Though that sacrifices the tactical advantage of them not knowing we know.\"\n\nThe prisoner watched this discussion with growing unease, realizing his capture had compromised the entire operation.\n\nThe commanders fell silent, waiting for Juan's response.\n\nCurrent Situation:\n\nTime: Late afternoon, May 9, 1431\nLocation: Castilian camp, 1 mile from Granada's western walls\nIntelligence: Near-certain knowledge of Sultan's sortie plan (2,500-3,000 troops, immediate upon refusal, goal to kill/capture Juan)\nSultan's Ignorance: Granada does not yet know their courier was captured and plan compromised\n\nCastilian Force: 10,000 troops in defensive camp, full strength, aware of trap\nGranada's Force: 3,000-3,500 troops inside city, sortie force assembled and waiting for tomorrow\n\nSeveral hours remain before nightfall for Juan to make decisions and give orders.\n\nWhat does Juan want to do?"

          "text": "Juan is making a bold decision - he'll proceed with approaching the gates as planned, but with full knowledge of the trap. He's turning the Sultan's ambush into a Castilian counter-trap.\n\nKey elements of his plan:\n1. 300 heavy cavalry escort with Juan\n2. Their job: hold long enough for reinforcements\n3. Infantry hidden under cover of darkness near the walls\n4. Main cavalry force at safe distance, ready to charge\n5. Pre-selected ground for the battle - outside missile range from walls\n6. Everyone in escort knows the retreat point and when to turn\n7. Exploit the bottleneck of troops deploying through gates\n\nThe Master of Calatrava and other commanders would need to respond to this plan, particularly:\n- What infantry can be hidden at night\n- How to position them\n- The tactical details of the counter-trap\n\nLet me think about realistic infantry deployment under darkness:\n- Need troops who can move quietly\n- Need good concealment positions near the gates but not too obvious\n- Probably 1,000-2,000 infantry maximum without being detected\n- Use terrain features - buildings, gardens, irrigation ditches, tree lines in the Vega\n- Position them to hit the sortie force's flanks once they're committed\n\nThe commanders would be analyzing this tactically.\n\nThe Master of Calatrava's expression transformed from concern to fierce approval. \"Your Majesty, that's... that's brilliant. Let the Sultan spring his trap, but we're ready for it. When his sortie pours out thinking they've caught us by surprise, they're the ones walking into our kill zone.\"\n\nHe moved immediately to the campaign map, gesturing for the other commanders to gather. \"Let me think through this tactically. We're essentially staging a meeting engagement, but with the advantage of preparation and knowledge.\"\n\nThe Battle Plan:\n\nDon García López de Padilla spoke first on the positioning. \"The ground for the fight—Your Majesty is right, we choose it in advance. I'd suggest six hundred to seven hundred yards from the western gate. That's beyond effective arrow range from the walls—maybe some long shots reach that far but not concentrated fire. It's also far enough that when the escort retreats to that point and turns, you have clear ground for the cavalry battle.\"\n\nThe Master nodded. \"Your 300 heavy cavalry escort rides with you to perhaps three hundred yards from the gate—close enough to make the demand credible and to bait the trap. When the Sultan refuses and the gates open, you conduct fighting retreat back to the seven-hundred-yard line. Your job isn't to defeat three thousand troops with three hundred—it's to delay them for perhaps five to eight minutes while the main force arrives.\"\n\nCaptain Fernán interjected: \"Every man in the escort must know exactly where that line is. We mark it tonight—perhaps with stakes or banners that look like normal camp markers. When we reach that line, we turn and hold. Not before, because we need to draw them out from the gates.\"\n\nThe Infantry Question:\n\nThe Master addressed Juan's question about hidden infantry. \"Your Majesty, deploying infantry under cover of darkness near Granada's walls is risky but possible. The question is: how many, where exactly, and what's their mission?\"\n\nDon Rodrigo de Perea, who'd coordinated the scouting, spoke: \"The Vega around Granada has terrain features we can use. About four hundred to five hundred yards from the western gate, there's an irrigation channel with some vegetation—low walls, olive trees, brush. Not thick cover, but in darkness, we could position perhaps 500 to 800 infantry there. They'd be on the sortie force's northern flank once the Moors commit to pursuing Your Majesty's escort.\"\n\n\"Alternatively,\" Don García added, \"there are some abandoned buildings and garden walls about six hundred yards to the south of the gate approach. We could hide another 500-800 infantry there—southern flank position.\"\n\nThe Master considered. \"I'd recommend both positions if we can manage it without detection. Total of 1,000 to 1,600 infantry split between north and south flanks. Their mission: remain completely hidden until the sortie force is fully committed—meaning they've pursued Your Majesty's escort well away from the gates and the main body has deployed. Then they emerge and hit the flanks simultaneously.\"\n\nHe traced the positions on the map. \"The beauty of this is the Moors will be focused entirely forward—chasing your escort, engaging your main cavalry force. Infantry hitting from both flanks creates panic and disruption. And critically, it prevents them from retreating easily back to the city gates.\"\n\nThe Gate Bottleneck:\n\nInfante Enrique, who'd been listening intently, spoke up from where he sat. \"Your Majesty identified the key advantage—the gates are a bottleneck. Even if the Sultan has three thousand troops ready, they can't all deploy instantly. A city gate that size... what, fifteen to twenty feet wide? They can fit perhaps twenty to thirty men abreast, moving quickly but not running into each other.\"\n\nThe Master calculated. \"So deploying three thousand troops through that gate, even moving fast, takes time. First troops out in seconds, but the full force? Five to ten minutes, possibly longer if there's any confusion. Which means for the first several minutes of the sortie, they're outnumbered by our response forces.\"\n\nCaptain Fernán saw the implication. \"That's when we hit them hardest. Your Majesty's escort holds the initial wave—maybe 500 to 800 troops who get through the gate first. Then our main cavalry arrives while they're still deploying. We catch them strung out, not fully formed.\"\n\nThe Full Tactical Plan:\n\nThe Master summarized: \"Here's the complete plan, Your Majesty, building on your concept:\n\nTonight (under darkness):\n\nDeploy 800 infantry to irrigation channel, 400 yards north of gate approach\n\nDeploy 800 infantry to abandoned buildings/gardens, 600 yards south of gate approach\n\nTotal: 1,600 hidden infantry on the flanks\n\nMark the seven-hundred-yard rally line clearly for the escort\n\nTomorrow morning:\n\nYour Majesty approaches with 300 heavy cavalry escort to ~300 yards from gate\n\nMain cavalry force (3,700) positioned at 1,000 yards, formed for immediate charge\n\nMain infantry (4,500) positioned at 1,200 yards in battle formation\n\nHidden flanking infantry remain concealed\n\nWhen the trap springs:\n\nSultan refuses, gates open, sortie begins\n\nYour escort conducts fighting retreat to seven-hundred-yard line\n\nHold that line for 3-5 minutes against initial sortie wave\n\nMain cavalry charges—arrives in ~2 minutes at full gallop\n\nEngage Moorish sortie while still deploying through bottleneck\n\nOnce Moors fully committed (majority through gates), flanking infantry emerges\n\nPincer closes: cavalry front, infantry flanks, city gates behind\n\nDestroy or capture the sortie force in detail\"\n\nDon García added grimly: \"If this works, Your Majesty, we don't just survive their ambush—we destroy a significant portion of Granada's garrison. Three thousand troops caught in the open, hit from three directions, can't retreat easily through that bottleneck. This could be a battle, not just a skirmish.\"\n\nThe Risks:\n\nCaptain Fernán voiced the concern everyone felt. \"Your Majesty, you're still the bait. That escort will face desperate fighting for several minutes. Three hundred against the initial waves of the sortie. Good men will die protecting you. And if anything goes wrong—if the main cavalry is delayed, if the sortie deploys faster than we expect—you're in mortal danger.\"\n\nThe Master met Juan's eyes. \"I won't sugarcoat this, Your Majesty. You're proposing to deliberately put yourself in the killing zone to bait this trap. It's tactically brilliant, but personally risky. Your 300-man escort needs to be the absolute best heavy cavalry we have—veterans who can hold a desperate fight and conduct disciplined fighting retreat under pressure.\"\n\nDon Rodrigo added: \"And the infantry deployment tonight—if Granada detects them, the whole plan fails. We'd have 1,600 men exposed near their walls with nowhere to retreat.\"\n\nThe Question:\n\nThe Master looked at Juan. \"Your Majesty, this plan can work. It turns their ambush into our victory. But I need to ask directly: are you absolutely committed to being the bait? Because if you are, we'll make this happen. We'll select the best 300 cavalry in this army, we'll position the forces perfectly, and we'll practice the fighting retreat so every man knows his role.\"\n\nHe paused. \"But if there's any doubt, we can modify—send a high-ranking noble to make the demand in your name, keep you safer with the main force. It's less dramatic, but you survive regardless of outcome.\"\n\nThe commanders waited. The plan was bold and tactically sound, but it required Juan to deliberately place himself in extreme danger.\n\nWhat does Juan decide? And if he's committed, what are his specific orders for the night infantry deployment and the escort selection?"

The rest of the army should deploy tomorrow to reinforce. I want all of our light cavalry to be ready and reach the battle as fast as possible. The main body of the infantry will fill in later and add weight to the battle line. The heavy cavalry must take it's time and deliver the hammer blow.

          "text": "Juan is refining the tactical plan. Let me track the key changes:\n\n1. Hidden infantry: 1,000 troops (not 1,600) positioned farther back for better secrecy\n2. Deployment sequence tomorrow:\n   - Light cavalry reaches battle first (speed priority)\n   - Main infantry fills in next (adds weight to line)\n   - Heavy cavalry delivers hammer blow (timing for maximum impact)\n3. Juan acknowledges he'll be \"in the chaos\" with the escort, can't command main forces\n4. Needs to identify cavalry commander\n\nThis is tactically sound - light cavalry has speed and can screen/harass, infantry provides staying power, heavy cavalry delivers the decisive charge.\n\nJuan is asking who commands the cavalry. Let me think about the forces present:\n\nFrom Alcalá:\n- Master of Calatrava (Pedro González de Padilla) - overall commander\n- Various Calatrava knights and commanders\n- Don García López de Padilla - senior knight\n- Don Rodrigo de Perea - reconnaissance coordinator\n- Captain Fernán Alonso de Robles - Juan's personal guard commander\n- Various other nobles and frontier captains\n\nFor cavalry command specifically, this would typically be a senior noble with cavalry experience. The Master of Calatrava would be overall commander. There should be a specific cavalry commander under him.\n\nI should introduce or identify who would naturally command the cavalry element. This would be someone:\n- Experienced in mounted warfare\n- Senior enough to command ~4,000 cavalry\n- Trusted by Juan and the Master\n- Not already assigned to other critical roles\n\nOptions:\n1. Don García López de Padilla (already mentioned, senior Calatrava knight)\n2. A Mendoza family member (but Íñigo is young and with embassy)\n3. One of the Military Order commanders\n4. A frontier noble with cavalry experience\n\nI think it makes sense that there's a specific cavalry commander - probably a senior noble or Military Order knight who's been with the army. Let me have the Master identify who this is.\n\nThe Master of Calatrava nodded approvingly at the refinements. \"Sound tactical thinking, Your Majesty. One thousand infantry farther back—that improves security significantly while still giving us the flanking force. And the phased commitment makes excellent sense: speed first, weight second, hammer third.\"\n\nAt Juan's question about cavalry command, the Master gestured to a grizzled nobleman who'd been standing near the back of the command group. \"Your Majesty, that would be Don Fadrique Enríquez de Mendoza, Admiral of Castile and master of the cavalry for this operation.\"\n\nThe man stepped forward—perhaps forty-five years old, scarred face, the bearing of someone who'd spent decades in the saddle. Despite his naval title, he was clearly a cavalry commander by experience and temperament.\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" Don Fadrique said with a formal bow. \"I've commanded the cavalry elements since we assembled at Jaén. Four thousand horse total—roughly split between 1,500 heavy cavalry and 2,500 light. If I understand the plan correctly, I'll be coordinating the response when you're engaged at the gates.\"\n\nThe Master confirmed: \"Don Fadrique is one of our most experienced mounted commanders. He fought at Antequera under your father, commanded cavalry operations on the frontier for fifteen years. He's the right man for this.\"\n\nDon Fadrique moved to the map. \"Let me confirm the tactical sequence, Your Majesty, so there's no confusion tomorrow:\n\nPhase One - Your Escort Engaged:\nYou approach with 300 heavy cavalry, make the demand, Sultan refuses, gates open. Your escort conducts fighting retreat to the seven-hundred-yard rally line and holds.\n\nPhase Two - Light Cavalry Response:\nAt first sign of the sortie, I send in the light cavalry—2,500 horse, moving at speed. They can cover the distance from our staging position in perhaps ninety seconds at full gallop. Their mission: screen your escort's flanks, harass the Moorish sortie's deployment, prevent them from enveloping your position. They're not meant to smash into the enemy—they're meant to buy time and disrupt.\n\nPhase Three - Infantry Reinforcement:\nThe main infantry—4,500 men—advance at best speed. They can't match cavalry pace, but at quick march they reach the battle line in perhaps four to five minutes. They form up and add weight, creating a solid line that the Moors can't easily break or get around.\n\nPhase Four - Heavy Cavalry Hammer:\nOnce the Moors are fully committed—meaning their sortie force is deployed and engaged with our light cavalry and infantry—I bring in the heavy cavalry. 1,500 armored horse in wedge formation, hitting wherever their line looks weakest or where breaking through creates maximum disruption. This is the decisive blow.\n\nPhase Five - Flanking Infantry:\nWhen the battle is fully joined and the Moors focused forward, our hidden infantry—1,000 troops positioned during the night—emerges from both flanks and closes the trap.\"\n\nHe looked at Juan directly. \"Your Majesty, once that sortie begins, you'll be in the thick of it with your escort. I'll be commanding from position where I can see the whole battlefield and commit forces as needed. You focus on surviving and fighting. I'll focus on winning the battle. Trust me to bring the weight of our army to bear at the right moments.\"\n\nDon García López de Padilla added: \"Your 300-man escort, Your Majesty—I recommend the Guardian Company as the core. They're your most elite troops, veterans who've sworn personal oaths. Add the best Calatrava heavy cavalry to bring it to 300 total. These men know how to fight desperate actions and hold impossible positions.\"\n\nCaptain Fernán spoke up: \"I'll be commanding your immediate household guard within that escort, Your Majesty. My job is to keep you alive during those first critical minutes. Sergeant García and Corporal Rodrigo will be with us—they've kept you safe since Valladolid, they'll do it again tomorrow.\"\n\nThe Master addressed the night deployment: \"For the hidden infantry—1,000 men positioned farther back for security. I recommend using experienced frontier troops who know how to move quietly and hold discipline. We deploy them in two groups of 500 each: one north, one south of the approach route, perhaps 600-700 yards from the gate rather than 400-500. Farther means safer from detection, though it means they take slightly longer to close when the trap springs.\"\n\nDon Rodrigo de Perea volunteered: \"I'll personally lead the night deployment, Your Majesty. My scouts know the ground, and I've done night operations against the Moors before. We'll get them into position without detection, or I'll abort if we're at risk of being spotted.\"\n\nThe Timeline:\n\nThe Master outlined: \"Here's the timeline for tonight and tomorrow:\n\nTonight (Next 6-8 hours):\n\nSelect the 1,000 infantry for flanking force—experienced, disciplined troops\n\nSelect the 300 heavy cavalry for escort—absolute best we have\n\nAfter full darkness (perhaps 10 PM), Don Rodrigo leads the infantry deployment\n\nTakes 2-3 hours to position both groups carefully and quietly\n\nInfantry must remain hidden and silent through the night until battle\n\nTomorrow Morning (Dawn, ~6 AM):\n\nArmy deploys in battle formation at designated positions\n\nLight cavalry: 2,500, ready for immediate response\n\nHeavy cavalry: 1,500, positioned for decisive charge\n\nMain infantry: 4,500, ready to advance\n\nReserve: 1,000 (to guard camp and respond to unexpected)\n\n~8-9 AM:\n\nYour Majesty approaches gates with 300-man escort\n\nMake formal demand\n\nBattle begins when Sultan refuses and sortie launches\"\n\nCaptain Fernán added practically: \"Your Majesty, you should rest tonight if possible. Tomorrow will be... intense. The escort troops will rest in shifts—half sleep while half remain alert. The hidden infantry will be uncomfortable but they're professionals, they'll manage.\"\n\nDon Fadrique spoke once more: \"Your Majesty, I want to be absolutely clear about one thing. Once that sortie launches and you're engaged, my priority is winning the battle—not rescuing you specifically. I'll commit forces to support your position, but I'll also exploit opportunities elsewhere if they appear. If the Moors leave a flank exposed or their formation breaks, I'll hit it even if it means temporarily less support for your escort. The fastest way to save you is to destroy their sortie force completely.\"\n\nHe met Juan's eyes. \"I'm telling you this now so there's no confusion tomorrow. Trust me to win the battle. Your escort's job is to keep you alive long enough for me to do that.\"\n\nThe Master looked around the command group. \"Does everyone understand their roles? Any questions or concerns about the plan?\"\n\nThe tent fell silent—the plan was set. Bold, risky, but tactically sound and built on the intelligence advantage they'd gained.\n\n\"Then gentlemen,\" the Master said, \"we have work to do. Don Rodrigo, begin selecting your flanking infantry. Captain Fernán, choose the escort cavalry. Don Fadrique, position your forces for tomorrow's deployment. The rest of you, ensure your units are ready. His Majesty has given us a battle plan. Let's execute it flawlessly.\"\n\nThe commanders dispersed to their tasks, leaving Juan with the Master and Captain Fernán.\n\nThe Master spoke quietly: \"Your Majesty, you've turned the Sultan's trap into our opportunity. If this works—when this works—we'll have destroyed a major portion of Granada's garrison in the open field. That's a victory that echoes beyond the immediate battle.\"\n\nHe paused. \"But I must ask one more time: are you absolutely certain about being in that escort? There's still time to—\"\n\nWhat does Juan say or do?"

          "text": "Juan is refining the tactical plan - he wants the flanking infantry to be the first to form a battle line, not wait until the end. This is actually more conservative and practical - they emerge early to form the defensive line, rather than waiting to spring the trap at the end. He's also clarifying the objective: win the battle and drive them back, not necessarily destroy them totally. This is more realistic.\n\nHe's also preparing for tomorrow and wants to scout the battlefield now before resting.\n\nI should:\n1. Have the Master acknowledge and adjust the plan based on this refinement\n2. Describe the battlefield scouting\n3. Move to evening/night preparations\n4. End with Juan resting before tomorrow's confrontation\n5. NOT generate dialogue or actions for Juan beyond what he's already specified\n\nThe Master of Calatrava immediately grasped the refinement. \"Ah—Your Majesty is right. That's more sound tactically. The flanking infantry doesn't wait to spring a trap at the climax—they're the initial defensive line that receives the sortie.\"\n\nHe adjusted his thinking aloud. \"So the sequence becomes: Sultan refuses, gates open, your escort begins fighting retreat. Immediately, the 1,000 flanking infantry emerges from concealment and rushes to form battle line at the rally point—they're moving while you're retreating. By the time you reach that seven-hundred-yard line, there's already infantry forming up to receive the Moorish charge. You and your escort slot into that line rather than standing alone.\"\n\nDon García nodded approvingly. \"Much better. The Moors sortie expecting to catch 300 cavalry isolated, but instead they see 300 cavalry falling back onto a rapidly forming infantry line. Changes their tactical situation immediately—they're not chasing scattered horsemen, they're engaging a defensive position.\"\n\nDon Fadrique added: \"And it gives me clearer commitment timing. Light cavalry screens and harasses during their sortie deployment. Flanking infantry forms the main defensive line. Main infantry reinforces that line. Heavy cavalry delivers the decisive counterattack once they're committed and disrupted. Clean phases, clear objectives.\"\n\nThe Master looked relieved. \"And Your Majesty is right about the objective. We're not trying to execute some perfect pincer that destroys every last man—that's a fantasy battle plan. We're trying to defeat their sortie, inflict heavy casualties, and drive them back through those gates in disorder. That's achievable and devastating enough. If we kill or capture five hundred to a thousand of their three thousand-man sortie force and send the rest fleeing, that's a major victory.\"\n\nCaptain Fernán spoke quietly. \"It also means the escort's job is clearer. Hold for those critical minutes during the retreat until the infantry line forms. Not hold indefinitely against impossible odds, just long enough for the plan to develop.\"\n\nScouting the Battlefield:\n\nThe Master gestured toward the tent entrance. \"Your Majesty wishes to scout the ground. Let's do it now while we still have evening light.\"\n\nThe command group mounted and rode carefully toward Granada's walls—not close enough to provoke a response, but close enough to study the terrain in detail. The lowering sun cast long shadows across the Vega, making features stand out clearly.\n\nDon Rodrigo de Perea, who'd been scouting this ground for two weeks, provided the guided tour. He pointed out the irrigation channel with its low stone walls and vegetation—about 600 yards north of the approach route. \"Northern flanking force positions there. Five hundred infantry can hide in that terrain, especially in darkness.\"\n\nThen to the south: abandoned farm buildings and olive grove perhaps 650 yards from the gate. \"Southern flanking force there. Another five hundred. Once darkness falls, we can get them into position using the terrain folds.\"\n\nHe indicated the approach route itself—a relatively clear path toward Granada's western gate. \"Your escort approaches here. Three hundred yards to the gate for the formal demand—close enough to be heard clearly, close enough to bait the trap.\"\n\nThen the critical ground: \"Seven hundred yards from the gate—this is where we make our stand. See that slight rise? Not much, maybe ten feet of elevation, but it's there. Good ground for a defensive line. We mark it tonight with what looks like routine camp markers—the escort knows to retreat to those markers and turn.\"\n\nThe terrain was good—relatively open approaches, clear sight lines, the slight rise providing modest advantage. Granada's western gate was visible in the distance, closed but clearly ready. The walls were heavily manned—hundreds of troops visible along the ramparts.\n\nDon García observed: \"When the sortie launches, they'll have perhaps two hundred to three hundred yards of open ground before they hit our forming line. That's enough distance that we can see them coming and prepare, but not so much they lose momentum or can easily withdraw.\"\n\nThe Master pointed toward the flanks. \"The flanking infantry emerges here and here, about four to five hundred yards from where the main fighting will be. Call it a two to three-minute run for infantry in armor to reach the battle line. So they need to start moving the instant the gates open—can't wait to see how the fight develops.\"\n\nAs the sun touched the horizon, casting Granada in golden light, the battlefield was clear in everyone's minds. The killing ground where tomorrow's battle would unfold.\n\nCaptain Fernán spoke quietly to Juan. \"Your Majesty, I've fought on the frontier for fifteen years. I've seen good ground and bad ground. This is... adequate. Not ideal, but we're not being foolish. The plan can work here.\"\n\nEvening - Final Preparations:\n\nThey returned to camp as darkness fell. The army was already preparing—troops being briefed, equipment checked, positions assigned for tomorrow's deployment.\n\nDon Rodrigo gathered his 1,000 flanking infantry—experienced frontier troops, many from units that had fought at Alcalá. He briefed them carefully: move in darkness, take position in the designated terrain, remain absolutely silent and hidden until the signal (the sortie emerging from Granada's gates), then rush to form battle line.\n\nThe infantry departed around 10 PM—dark shapes moving carefully through the night. The Master and several commanders watched them go. By midnight, word returned: both groups successfully positioned, undetected. The trap was set.\n\nCaptain Fernán assembled the 300 escort cavalry. He'd selected them personally—50 from the Guardian Company, 150 of the finest Calatrava heavy cavalry, 100 veteran frontier horsemen. These were the men who would hold the line tomorrow while outnumbered 10 to 1 in those first desperate minutes.\n\nHe gathered them and spoke plainly: \"Tomorrow, His Majesty rides to Granada's gates to demand the Sultan's surrender. We ride with him. When the Sultan refuses, three thousand Moorish troops will pour out of that gate to kill him. Our job is simple: keep the king alive for five minutes while the army arrives. Five minutes against three thousand. If any of you want to withdraw now, do it. No shame. This is a desperate fight.\"\n\nNot a single man moved.\n\nSergeant García spoke for them all: \"We've followed His Majesty since Valladolid. We'll follow him tomorrow. Five minutes? We'll give him ten.\"\n\nThe escort was ready.\n\nNight:\n\nThe camp settled into watchful quiet. Most of the army slept, knowing tomorrow would bring battle. Pickets reported no unusual activity from Granada—the city remained alert but showed no sign of detecting the hidden flanking forces.\n\nIn his tent, Juan had time to pray, to think, to prepare mentally for what tomorrow would bring. Captain Fernán ensured his armor was perfectly maintained, every strap checked, every piece fitted properly. This was not ceremonial armor tomorrow—this was war gear that might save his life.\n\nFray Hernando was in Rome, but other clergy moved through the camp blessing troops and hearing confessions. Some of the escort spent their last hours before battle in prayer.\n\nThe Master of Calatrava visited Juan's tent once more before retiring. \"Your Majesty, everything is ready. The flanking infantry is in position. The escort knows their role. Don Fadrique has the cavalry positioned for tomorrow's deployment. The battle plan is sound.\"\n\nHe paused at the tent entrance. \"Tomorrow, you're going to stand before Granada's gates and demand a Muslim sultan's surrender in the heart of his own territory. Whether he attacks or not, whether the battle goes well or poorly, men will remember this for centuries. Sleep well, Your Majesty. Tomorrow, you make history.\"\n\nDawn, May 10, 1431\n\nThe eastern sky was just beginning to lighten when the camp stirred to life. The army assembled with practiced efficiency—10,000 troops deploying into their assigned positions.\n\nThe light cavalry formed up closest to Granada—2,500 horsemen ready to respond instantly. Behind them, the heavy cavalry under Don Fadrique—1,500 armored lancers in formation. The main infantry spread across the field—4,500 men in battle lines. Reserve forces guarded the camp.\n\nIn the predawn darkness, the hidden flanking infantry remained in position, silent and waiting. They'd been there for seven hours, cold and uncomfortable, but professional and disciplined.\n\nJuan donned his armor with Captain Fernán's assistance. White-painted steel, white surcoat with the red cross, his father's sword at his side. The crusade banner would be carried beside him.\n\nThe 300 escort cavalry assembled—grim-faced men checking weapons and armor one final time. These were veterans who understood exactly what they were riding into.\n\nSergeant García and Corporal Rodrigo took their positions flanking Juan, as they had since Valladolid. Neither spoke, but their presence was steady.\n\nAs the sun broke the horizon, bathing the Vega in golden morning light, the Master of Calatrava rode to Juan's side. \"Your Majesty, the army is deployed. The trap is set. We wait only for your command.\"\n\nGranada's walls were clearly visible a mile distant. The red walls of the Alhambra glowed in the early light. Somewhere behind those walls, Sultan Muhammad IX waited, his 3,000-man sortie force assembled and ready to spring what he thought was an ambush.\n\nBut he didn't know the Castilians knew. He didn't know about the captured courier. He didn't know the trap had been turned.\n\nThe battlefield awaited.\n\nWhat does Juan do?"
