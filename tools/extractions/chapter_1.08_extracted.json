They defied arrest orders in September\n4. They know Juan has papal backing, crusaders, Portuguese betrothal\n5. They're coming to a council where their rebellion will be addressed\n6. They have ~4,500-6,000 troops (with Master of Santiago)\n7. They control Arévalo fortress and 2 minor castles\n8. Alfonso V is watching carefully from Naples\n\nKey questions about their behavior:\n- Will they be hostile, conciliatory, proud, desperate?\n- How do they view their position - weak or still dangerous?\n- What's their strategy for the Council?\n\nBased on what I know:\n- Infante Juan (elder) is sophisticated, calculating, political operator\n- Infante Enrique is more martial, direct, honorable\n- They were humiliated by failed rebellion\n- They're under safe conduct so can't be arrested during Council\n- They know they need to either win noble support or reach accommodation\n\nI should portray them as:\n- Outwardly respectful (under safe conduct, guests in Juan's palace)\n- But with underlying tension\n- Calculating their moves\n- Probably trying to assess Juan's state of mind\n- Testing boundaries while not overtly violating hospitality\n\nThis is the calm before the storm - the Council will be the confrontation. This meeting is about taking each other's measure.\n\nLet me create a tense but civil scene where both sides are being careful, but the power dynamics and history between them are clear.\n\nChapter 8: The Council of Seville\n\nNovember 8, 1430 - Morning\n\nThe Morning Before\n\nThe sun has barely risen over Seville when you make your way through the royal palace corridors toward the guest quarters. The Infantes arrived yesterday evening as promised - Infante Juan de Aragón and Infante Enrique, each with a modest retinue of ten men. They've been housed in comfortable apartments in the palace's east wing, far from the throne room where this afternoon's Council will convene.\n\nYour guards follow at a respectful distance as you approach their quarters. Captain Fernán nods to you - he's positioned men discretely throughout this wing, not overtly threatening but present.\n\nAs you round the final corner, you find both Infantes already awake and dressed, standing in the corridor outside their apartments as if they were waiting for you. Perhaps they were.\n\nInfante Juan de Aragón stands with his characteristic composure - he's about 35, well-dressed in dark burgundy velvet, his beard neatly trimmed, intelligent eyes watching you carefully. There's no warmth in his expression, but nor is there open hostility. He seems... calculating.\n\nInfante Enrique, perhaps two years younger, wears more martial attire - a fine doublet but practical, a sword at his hip even here. His bearing is different from his brother's - more direct, less diplomatic. He watches you with what might be grudging respect.\n\nBoth men bow as you approach, the proper courtesy for royal princes greeting their king. Not deep bows - just enough to acknowledge your rank without suggesting submission.\n\nInfante Juan speaks first, his voice carefully neutral:\n\n\"Your Majesty. We thank you for your hospitality and the safe conduct. The accommodations have been... comfortable.\"\n\nThere's a pause, weighted with unspoken history. The last time you saw Infante Juan was when you removed him from the regency council in that dramatic confrontation. The last time you spoke was through Álvaro's summons for arrest, which they publicly defied.\n\nInfante Enrique adds, his tone more direct:\n\n\"We received your food and lodging as guests should. We'll hear what you have to say at the Council this afternoon. That's what we came for.\"\n\nNot hostile, but not friendly. Acknowledging the formalities while making clear they haven't come to grovel.\n\nBoth men stand waiting, watching you. The corridor is quiet except for distant palace sounds - servants preparing for the day, guards changing posts, the morning bustle of Seville beyond the walls.\n\nWhat do you say or do?"

          "text": "Juan is being perfectly polite and formal, but also keeping it brief and not engaging in any substantive discussion before the Council. This is a smart diplomatic move - acknowledge them, show basic courtesy as host, but don't get drawn into any arguments or negotiations in private.\n\nLet me describe their reactions and then move us toward the Council itself.\n\nBoth Infantes bow again as you deliver your brief greeting.\n\nInfante Juan's eyes narrow slightly - he seems almost surprised by your restraint. Perhaps he expected confrontation, or demands, or some attempt to negotiate privately before the public forum. Your controlled courtesy leaves him with nothing to react against.\n\n\"Until this afternoon, Your Majesty,\" he replies, matching your formality.\n\nInfante Enrique simply nods, though you catch what might be the ghost of approval in his expression. He always respected directness.\n\nAs you turn to leave, you hear Infante Juan murmur something to his brother in low tones - not quite meant for your ears, but not fully concealed either:\n\n\"...more controlled than before. Someone's been teaching him...\"\n\nYou walk away down the corridor, Captain Fernán falling into step beside you. Once you're out of earshot, he speaks quietly:\n\n\"They seemed... wary, Your Majesty. Not confident. Not broken either, but uncertain. Good.\"\n\nThe Hours Before Council\n\nThe morning passes with final preparations. Diego arrives with status reports:\n\nAttendance confirmed:\n\n68 nobles (of the 80 originally invited - some sent representatives, a few claimed illness)\n\nAll three Military Order Masters (Santiago, Calatrava, Alcántara)\n\nArchbishop of Toledo\n\nArchbishop of Seville (hosting in his palace)\n\nBishops from Burgos, Córdoba, Segovia\n\nRepresentatives from major cities (Seville, Toledo, Burgos, Valladolid)\n\nYour sister María sent a letter of support (read aloud at the Council)\n\nThe 151 crusaders are assembled in the cathedral plaza as planned, with the white banner and relics prepared for the ceremonial conclusion.\n\nÁlvaro meets with you one final time:\n\n\"The morning meetings suggest the nobles are genuinely curious. Many arrived yesterday wanting to see the papal bull with their own eyes. Word about Granada's strength has spread - that's working in your favor. They're frightened. Fear can motivate when pride cannot.\"\n\nHe pauses. \"One more thing - I've heard the Infantes plan to speak briefly when given chance. They'll acknowledge wrongdoing but claim it was Álvaro's influence they opposed, not your authority. They'll try to separate you from me, offer submission to you personally if you distance yourself from your Constable.\"\n\nHis expression doesn't change. \"It's what I'd do in their position. Clever. Puts you in difficult spot before the nobles.\"\n\nThe bells of Seville Cathedral begin ringing the hour. Noon. Time to proceed to the Council chamber.\n\nHow do you wish to prepare in these final moments? And shall we proceed to the Council itself?"

He opens by announcing the Portuguese betrothal (SUCCESS roll — nobles impressed), then describes Barcelona's warm welcome and Aragonese diplomatic relations (SUCCESS), then presents the papal bull with the Archbishop of Toledo's endorsement (SUCCESS — nobles pledge their arms to the crusade). Finally, Juan frames the Infantes' rebellion as an obstacle to the sacred crusade (GREAT SUCCESS — seamless transition, Álvaro's evidence is devastating, twelve witnesses testify, the case is overwhelming). Through four successive successful rolls, Juan transforms from a young king defending his throne into the divinely mandated leader of a holy crusade, making opposition to him opposition to God.",

The Infantes' reaction (caught off-balance but not silenced)\n5. The momentum Juan has established\n\nI should make this feel like a success - the nobles are impressed, the momentum is his, but there's still tension and the Infantes haven't been neutralized, just temporarily sidelined.\n\nThe Council Opens - SUCCESS\n\nThe Archbishop's palace council chamber falls silent as you stride to the central table. The room is magnificent - high vaulted ceilings, tall windows letting in autumn sunlight, tapestries depicting saints and battles. The nobles are arranged in a horseshoe formation around the central space, seated on benches according to rank.\n\nYou don't wait for formal introductions or ceremonial opening. You simply step forward and begin speaking, your voice carrying clearly across the chamber:\n\n\"Welcome, my fellow Castilians. It feels like a lifetime ago when I summoned you all to be here on this day at this hour to together address the issues of the realm. For no king rules alone and I value your council. We are all in this together and I have great news for our kingdom!\"\n\nThe nobles straighten in their seats. Several who had been murmuring to neighbors fall silent. You've caught them off-guard with the energy and confidence in your voice.\n\nYou raise the Portuguese letter high - the royal seal clearly visible, the fine parchment catching the light:\n\n\"With pride I can announce that I am betrothed to Princess Isabel of Portugal. She sails to Seville as we speak and we plan to marry as soon as possible. Not only is her dowry substantial, Portugal offers all sorts of benefits such as naval support and it ensures a strong alliance on our western flank. We need strong allies in the years to come.\"\n\nA ripple moves through the chamber - nobles leaning forward, exchanging glances, some nodding approvingly. You catch genuine surprise on many faces. The succession question has been their unspoken concern since you returned - a young king without heir facing potential civil war. You've just answered it decisively.\n\n\"But I am also happy to finally get married. Her character comes strongly recommended. Castile needs a royal family and I am sure Isabel will make a fine queen.\"\n\nThe Archbishop of Toledo rises briefly: \"Your Majesty, this is indeed joyous news. The realm rejoices with you.\" His endorsement carries weight - the Church blessing the match publicly.\n\nCount of Benavente (one of the neutral nobles) speaks up: \"Your Majesty, might we inquire about the terms? A Portuguese alliance...\"\n\n\"Sixty thousand gold dobras,\" you state clearly. \"Eight Portuguese galleys for one year. Defensive alliance and trade privileges. The Princess is fifteen, of excellent character, and arrives mid-December.\"\n\nImpressed murmurs. That's an exceptional dowry - roughly 180,000 florins. Several nobles do the calculation visibly, eyes widening.\n\nThe Infantes' Reaction:\n\nInfante Juan has remained seated, his face carefully neutral, but you catch the flash of calculation in his eyes. He'd been preparing to make the first move, to frame the narrative. Instead you've seized the initiative with news that makes you look strong, forward-thinking, and dynastically secure.\n\nInfante Enrique leans back slightly, arms crossed. His expression is harder to read - perhaps grudging acknowledgment that this was well-played.\n\nNeither attempts to interrupt yet. They're reassessing.\n\nThe Chamber's Energy:\n\nThe mood has shifted palpably. Nobles who entered uncertain, worried about civil war and royal weakness, are now seeing a young king who secured papal backing, raised crusader army, and just announced a brilliant marriage alliance. You look like someone solving problems, not creating them.\n\nÁlvaro de Luna, seated to the side, catches your eye briefly. The slightest nod of approval. You've bought yourself credibility.\n\nThe Duke of Medina Sidonia (powerful Andalusian noble, previously neutral) speaks: \"The Portuguese fleet will be valuable indeed if we're to face Granada. And the succession secured...\" He doesn't finish, but the implication is clear - you're thinking ahead, planning for stability.\n\nThe chamber waits for you to continue. You have the floor completely, the momentum is yours, and the nobles are listening intently.\n\nWhat do you do next? Do you proceed to the Aragonese letter as you planned?"

The Barcelona success is undeniable, and framing good Aragonese relations as strategic (securing flanks for crusade) rather than personal is smart. The nobles want to see diplomatic competence.\n\nThe risk is that the Infantes might feel this is the moment to interject - \"His Majesty speaks of good relations with our brother while ordering our arrest\" - but if Juan maintains momentum and doesn't pause for response, he can keep control.\n\nI'll assess this as **LIKELY TO SUCCEED** - the momentum is still with him, the facts are on his side, and he's building a coherent narrative (diplomatic security → crusade mandate → dealing with internal threats).\n\nProbability Assessment: LIKELY TO SUCCEED\n\nFactors in your favor:\n\nYou still have momentum from the Portuguese announcement\n\nBarcelona success is real and impressive (82,000 florins, crusaders recruited)\n\nMentioning María personalizes the Aragonese connection positively\n\nAlfonso's letter does show openness to cooperation\n\nFraming as \"securing flanks\" for crusade shows strategic thinking\n\nBuilding toward papal bull maintains narrative control\n\nPhysical proof again (Alfonso's letter)\n\nPotential complications:\n\nThe Infantes ARE Alfonso's brothers - this is delicate territory\n\nAlfonso's letter was cautious, not fully committed\n\nSome nobles might see contradiction between \"good relations\" and the arrest orders\n\nThe Infantes may feel compelled to respond when their brother is mentioned\n\nRisk of the transition feeling too rapid if you don't let nobles absorb information\n\nOverall assessment: You're riding momentum skillfully. Presenting diplomatic successes on both borders before addressing internal conflict is smart framing - it shows you thinking about Castile's strategic position. The Barcelona success is undeniable. However, mentioning Aragon while the Infantes sit in the room is provocative, though if delivered confidently it reinforces that you're operating at a higher level than factional disputes.\n\nThe key is maintaining pace so the Infantes don't find an opening to interrupt before you reach the papal bull - your strongest card.\n\nPlease roll your dice and tell me the result:\n\nGreat Success\n\nSuccess\n\nFailure\n\nCatastrophic Failure"

Portugal to the west, Aragon to the east - Castile's position strengthens considerably.\"\n\nCount of Haro (previously leaning toward the Infantes): \"And both secured through diplomacy rather than conflict. Impressive, Your Majesty.\"\n\nYou can see the shift. Nobles who entered this chamber worried about a young king losing control are instead seeing strategic vision. You've presented yourself as someone thinking about Castile's place among Christian kingdoms, not just internal squabbles.\n\nThe Infantes' Position Weakens:\n\nInfante Juan's carefully prepared speech about \"loyal opposition to Álvaro's influence\" suddenly seems petty in comparison. You've just demonstrated operating on a different level entirely - securing marriage alliances, building diplomatic relationships, raising massive funds abroad. Their rebellion looks increasingly like small-minded power-grabbing.\n\nInfante Enrique shifts in his seat, clearly uncomfortable. He can read the room - his brother's strategy of framing this as \"concerned princes trying to save the kingdom from bad advisors\" is losing ground with every moment you demonstrate competence.\n\nDuke of Alba (influential neutral): \"Your Majesty, these diplomatic achievements, combined with the papal backing we've heard whispers of... might we now see this bull you mentioned?\"\n\nThe chamber murmurs agreement. They're eager, leaning forward. You've built anticipation perfectly.\n\nMaster of Calatrava adds: \"Indeed. We've heard remarkable stories about Rome. The truth would be most welcome.\"\n\nEven the nobles who support the Infantes look curious rather than hostile. You've framed everything so positively - Portuguese marriage, Aragonese cooperation, Barcelona's generosity - that opposing you now would mean opposing Castile's manifest success.\n\nÁlvaro remains silent, but you catch the satisfaction in his eyes. The Infantes planned to make this about him, about their \"loyal opposition\" to a controversial favorite. Instead you've made it about Castile's international standing, strategic security, and divine mandate.\n\nThe chamber waits, hushed with anticipation. Sixty-eight nobles, three Military Order Masters, multiple bishops and archbishops, city representatives - all focused on you and what comes next.\n\nYou mentioned the papal bull to transition. How do you wish to present it? Do you have it brought forward ceremonially? Do you read it yourself or have the Archbishop read it? This is your strongest card - how do you play it?"

The papal bull's content is so powerful (the Pope wept, called it unprecedented, granted supreme command), and Juan's presentation combines genuine piety with masterful stagecraft. The kneeling with sword recalls his Rome moment but here before all the nobles. The prayer prevents interruption while cementing the religious nature of the crusade. The Infantes have no counter to divine authority - they can argue politics but not papal commission.\n\nThe only way this doesn't work is if the Infantes do something dramatic to interrupt, but even that would backfire terribly given the religious framing.\n\nI'll say HIGH PROBABILITY OF SUCCESS - this should be very effective.\n\nProbability Assessment: HIGH PROBABILITY OF SUCCESS\n\nFactors strongly in your favor:\n\nThe papal bull is your absolute strongest card - divine authority trumps political disputes\n\nHaving the Archbishop read it adds Church endorsement and authority\n\nThe bull's content is extraordinary (Pope's tears, your renunciation, supreme command)\n\nKneeling with sword mirrors your Rome moment - powerful symbolism nobles will recognize\n\nCalling for prayer prevents interruption while cementing religious framing\n\nYou already have momentum from two successful announcements\n\nPhysical presence of bull, solemn reading, prayer ceremony - overwhelming sensory impact\n\nTransforming political meeting into sacred moment makes opposition seem sacrilegious\n\nThe Infantes cannot interrupt prayer without appearing impious\n\nYou're demonstrating humility (kneeling) while wielding ultimate authority (papal commission)\n\nMinor complications:\n\nReading entire bull takes time - some attention might waver\n\nA few cynical nobles might see theatricality\n\nThe Infantes might attempt desperate interruption before you kneel\n\nOverall assessment: This is masterful stagecraft combined with genuine sacred authority. The papal bull's content is so powerful that simply reading it aloud will stun the chamber. Your presentation transforms potential political argument into religious calling. The Infantes have no counter to divine mandate - they can dispute politics but not papal commission blessed by the Pope's own tears.\n\nThe kneeling moment especially is brilliant - echoes your Rome renunciation, demonstrates the humility that moved Pope Martin V, and forces every noble to either join you in reverence or mark themselves as opposing God's will.\n\nPlease roll your dice and tell me the result:\n\nGreat Success\n\nSuccess\n\nFailure\n\nCatastrophic Failure"

          "text": "The success means this works very well - nobles are moved, the religious framing is powerful, momentum continues. But it's not a great success, so there might be some who remain skeptical or the Infantes might have one last card to play afterward.\n\nLet me craft this carefully with all the theatrical elements Juan described.\n\nThe Papal Bull - SUCCESS\n\nYou gesture toward the table where the papal bull rests - the parchment rolled and sealed, the great leaden seal visible with its red and yellow silk cords. You walk toward it slowly, letting the moment build.\n\n\"I have retold the story of my journey many times, but nothing rises above the elegance of the words written down by our holy Pope himself. Our father in Rome was so kind to let the events of our meeting be written down in the bull, reminding me of my most sacred and profound moment of my life.\"\n\nThe chamber is utterly silent now. You turn to the Archbishop of Toledo, your voice warm:\n\n\"Will our Archbishop honour us by coming forward and read the bull before this noble gathering?\"\n\nArchbishop Juan Martínez de Contreras rises with dignified solemnity. He's perhaps fifty, lean and ascetic, with the bearing of someone who has served the Church for decades. He approaches the table and you assist him - carefully unrolling the parchment, smoothing it flat, positioning it so the light catches the elegant script.\n\nThe Archbishop's hands tremble slightly as he touches the papal seal - this is, after all, direct communication from the Vicar of Christ. He clears his throat and begins to read in clear Latin, then translating key passages into Castilian for those whose Latin is weak:\n\n\"MARTIN, BISHOP, SERVANT OF THE SERVANTS OF GOD...\"\n\nThe Archbishop's voice carries clearly through the vaulted chamber. As he reads the preamble describing your pilgrimage and arrival in Rome, nobles lean forward, straining to hear every word.\n\n\"...this young king did strip himself of crown, wealth, and worldly garments, offering his very person and kingdom to God's service through the ministry of the Apostolic See. By this act of complete renunciation and offering, he has shown himself worthy to be called a true soldier of Christ and a faithful son of the Church.\"\n\nGasps. Several nobles exchange incredulous looks. The Duke of Medina Sidonia whispers to his neighbor: \"Stripped himself naked before the Pope?\"\n\n\"Moved by the Holy Spirit and recognizing the sincere faith of this Our son...\"\n\nThe Archbishop continues through Article I - the proclamation of crusade. His voice grows stronger, more passionate:\n\n\"A plenary and universal CRUSADE against the Moorish Kingdom of Granada, for the recovery of Christian lands unjustly held, for the liberation of souls dwelling in the darkness of false belief, and for the completion of that sacred Reconquista begun by the faithful kings of Spain in ages past.\"\n\nThe chamber erupts in murmurs - quickly hushed as people strain to hear more.\n\nArticle II brings stunned silence:\n\n\"WE DO APPOINT AND COMMISSION Our beloved son Juan, King of Castile and León, as SUPREME COMMANDER of this Holy Crusade, with full, complete, and exclusive authority over all military operations, strategic decisions, and temporal governance of crusading forces.\"\n\nMaster of Santiago (Luis de Guzmán, aligned with the Infantes) goes pale. The implications are clear - his Order must submit to royal command.\n\n\"Any Christian who refuses the lawful commands of the Supreme Commander in matters pertaining to this Crusade, or who pursues independent military action contrary to his orders, shall be subject to ecclesiastical censure including possible excommunication...\"\n\nSeveral nobles who had been leaning toward the Infantes sit back heavily. The papal bull doesn't just authorize the crusade - it strips them of the ability to independently oppose.\n\nThe Archbishop reads through the Military Orders article, the crusade taxation, the spiritual benefits. When he reaches Article VII about the Papal Legate, Infante Juan shifts uncomfortably - Church oversight of the crusade means his family's influence is minimal.\n\nBut it's the final passages that truly stun the chamber. The Archbishop's voice grows thick with emotion:\n\n\"We have witnessed in Our own presence a young king who offered everything - crown, wealth, even the very clothes upon his back - in service to God. This act of profound humility and complete submission moves Us to grant this bull with confidence that it shall be used not for worldly ambition but for God's glory.\"\n\nAnd then, the most powerful section - the Pope's personal words:\n\n\"To Juan, King of Castile: Remember always the moment you knelt before Us. Let the inscription on your father's sword guide you: Non Nobis Domine - Not unto us, O Lord. Victory, if it comes, belongs to God alone.\"\n\nThe Archbishop's voice cracks slightly as he reads the Pope's final blessing, the attestation, and concludes:\n\n\"Given at Rome, at Saint Peter's, in the year of the Incarnation of Our Lord one thousand four hundred and thirty, on the first day of August, in the thirteenth year of Our Pontificate.\"\n\nHe looks up, visibly moved. \"Witnessed by Cardinal Giordano Orsini and sealed with the Fisherman's Ring and the leaden seal of the Apostolic See.\"\n\nThe Chamber's Reaction:\n\nSilence. Profound, overwhelming silence.\n\nThen Count of Benavente drops to one knee. Then another noble. Then ten more. Within moments, half the chamber is kneeling.\n\nThe Archbishop of Seville has tears streaming down his face. Several bishops are making the sign of the cross repeatedly.\n\nEven hardened warriors like the Master of Calatrava look shaken. The Pope himself wept at what he witnessed. The Pope himself commissioned this crusade after seeing a king strip himself naked in humility.\n\nThe Infantes' Position Collapses:\n\nInfante Juan sits frozen, his face drained of color. Whatever arguments he prepared - whatever political maneuvering he planned - are rendered meaningless. You don't have just papal authorization. You have papal devotion. The Vicar of Christ blessed you with tears and trembling hands.\n\nInfante Enrique stares at you with something approaching awe mixed with despair. How do you fight someone the Pope himself called \"a true soldier of Christ\"?\n\nYour Moment:\n\nYou step forward, your voice clear but reverent:\n\n\"This charges me with a holy task. A task that I aim to complete. I ask all Christians to join me in this effort and to share in the glory of finally completing the Reconquista. We have the will, we have the means, we carry a piece of the true cross of our Lord Savior Jesus Christ - how can we refuse such a calling?\"\n\nYou turn to the Archbishop, your voice gentle:\n\n\"Archbishop, I feel like we should take a short moment to pray and reflect on what this means for all of us. Will you lead us in a short prayer?\"\n\nBefore he can respond, you draw your father's sword - the blade catching the light, the inscription Non Nobis Domine visible to those nearby. You drop to one knee before the papal bull, holding the sword point-down in the classic crusader's posture. You close your eyes, head bowed.\n\nThe Archbishop, deeply moved, begins without hesitation:\n\n\"Omnipotent and eternal God, who through your servant Martin, Bishop of Rome, has called your faithful son Juan to complete the sacred work of Reconquista...\"\n\nAround the chamber, the rustling of fabric as more nobles kneel. The standing ones feel conspicuous, exposed. Within thirty seconds, every person in the chamber is on their knees except a handful - and even those are bowing their heads.\n\n\"Grant him wisdom in counsel, courage in battle, and mercy in victory. Guide his sword, strengthen his arm, and purify his heart. Let this crusade be not for earthly glory but for Your greater glory. Through Christ our Lord...\"\n\n\"Amen,\" echoes through the chamber like thunder. Sixty-eight voices, multiple bishops, the Masters of the Military Orders, all united in that single word.\n\nThe Archbishop continues:\n\n\"Blessed are they who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied. Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy. Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.\"\n\nYou remain kneeling, sword held steady, eyes closed. The image is perfect - a young king in humble supplication before divine authority, yet holding the sword of righteous war. Vulnerable yet dangerous. Pious yet powerful.\n\n\"May the blessing of Almighty God, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, descend upon King Juan and all who join him in this holy crusade. Amen.\"\n\n\"Amen.\"\n\nSilence again. You can hear your own breathing, the distant sounds of Seville outside, the shuffle of fabric as people wait for you to rise.\n\nThe Aftermath:\n\nYou stand slowly, sheathe your sword, and look across the chamber. What you see is transformation:\n\nCount of Haro (who entered leaning toward the Infantes): On his knees still, tears on his weathered face, staring at you like he's seen a vision.\n\nDuke of Alba: Eyes closed in prayer, hands clasped, genuinely moved.\n\nMaster of Santiago (Luis de Guzmán, the Infantes' ally): Pale, shaken, trapped. The papal bull commands him to serve under your authority. Refusal means excommunication.\n\nMultiple neutral nobles: Looking at you with something between reverence and calculation. You're not just a king anymore - you're the Pope's chosen instrument.\n\nEven Álvaro de Luna looks slightly awed. He's seen you grow from uncertain youth to this - a king who somehow convinced the Pope himself to weep and bless and commission.\n\nThe Infantes:\n\nInfante Juan has risen to his feet, but he looks diminished. His careful political arguments seem petty next to papal tears and divine commission. He opens his mouth as if to speak, then closes it. What can he say?\n\nInfante Enrique remains kneeling, staring at the floor. His whole body language suggests defeat.\n\nDuke of Medina Sidonia speaks, his voice shaking slightly:\n\n\"Your Majesty... I had heard stories. Rumors from Rome. But to hear it read... to understand what the Holy Father witnessed...\" He swallows hard. \"Andalusia stands ready to join the crusade.\"\n\nCount of Benavente: \"As does León, Your Majesty. Command us.\"\n\nOne by one, nobles are pledging. Not because of political calculation - because you've transformed this from political dispute into religious calling. To oppose you now is to oppose the Pope, the Church, God's will itself.\n\nThe Archbishop of Toledo approaches you, takes your hand:\n\n\"Your Majesty, I have served the Church for thirty years. I have never - never - read a papal bull like this. Pope Martin V doesn't just authorize your crusade. He loves you. He saw something in you that moved him to tears.\" The old man's eyes are wet. \"I see it too now. God's hand is upon you.\"\n\nThe chamber buzzes with energy - not the tense conflict they expected, but something approaching religious fervor. You've turned a political council into a revival meeting.\n\nBut the Infantes still sit in the chamber. Your momentum is overwhelming, but they haven't formally responded. They can't counter the papal bull, but they might still try to salvage something.\n\nWhat do you do next? Do you address the Infantes directly? Give them opportunity to speak? Press your advantage further? The chamber is yours completely - how do you use this moment?"

Reminding everyone about safe conduct (showing he keeps his word)\n6.

You're offering proper justice.\n\n\"Álvaro, I ask you to present the accusation and witnesses to the offence.\"\n\nÁlvaro's Presentation\n\nÁlvaro de Luna rises with controlled formality. He's dressed soberly in dark blue and black - not his usual finery. He looks less like the controversial favorite and more like a royal prosecutor.\n\n\"Your Majesty, assembled lords, I present evidence of rebellion and treason committed by the Infantes de Aragón during His Majesty's sacred pilgrimage to Rome.\"\n\nHe gestures to Diego, who produces a leather folder containing documents.\n\n\"First, the timeline. His Majesty departed Valladolid on May 14, 1430, on pilgrimage. Within one week, unauthorized letters began circulating throughout Castile.\"\n\nDiego hands several documents to nobles in the front rows, who pass them back. You can see noble faces darkening as they read.\n\n\"These letters,\" Álvaro continues, \"portray His Majesty as unstable, dominated by low-born advisors - meaning myself - and claim the realm requires 'firm governance' in his absence.\"\n\nCount of Benavente (holding one letter): \"This calls for an assembly at Burgos. An unauthorized assembly.\"\n\n\"Indeed, my lord,\" Álvaro nods. \"An assembly held without royal sanction, while the king was absent. Twenty-three nobles attended - I have the names if the council wishes them.\"\n\nDuke of Alba: \"That's open rebellion. Calling assembly without royal approval...\"\n\nÁlvaro continues: \"But words alone are not treason. Actions followed. Between July and August, while His Majesty prayed in Rome and sought papal blessing for the crusade that will save Christian souls, the Infantes seized fortresses by force.\"\n\nHe produces more documents - garrison reports, testimony from castellans.\n\n\"Arévalo fortress, taken July 18th. Castle of Portillo, taken July 22nd. Castle of Olmedo, attempted but failed July 28th - the castellan remained loyal and refused entry.\"\n\nMurmurs ripple through the chamber. Master of Calatrava looks genuinely shocked.\n\n\"The City of Segovia was approached directly. I have the city council's written response.\"\n\nHe reads: \"Segovia serves the King, not princes of Aragon. We will not open our gates.\"\n\nSeveral nobles smile grimly. Segovia's blunt refusal is legendary Castilian pride.\n\n\"But most damning,\" Álvaro's voice drops, becoming harder, \"when His Majesty returned and, through proper legal process, summoned the Infantes to surrender for trial, they publicly refused. Not just refused - they fortified positions and prepared for armed resistance.\"\n\nHe looks directly at the Infantes: \"The standoff at Arévalo lasted three days. Royal troops surrounded the fortress. The Infantes' forces manned the walls. Only the threat of full siege and the arrival of letters from King Alfonso V prevented bloodshed.\"\n\nThe chamber is utterly silent.\n\n\"This is not political disagreement. This is not 'loyal opposition to bad counsel.' This is armed rebellion. Seizure of royal fortresses. Refusal of lawful royal summons. Preparation for civil war while their king sought the Pope's blessing to fight for Christ.\"\n\nThe First Witness: Archbishop of Toledo\n\nÁlvaro gestures: \"I call Archbishop Juan Martínez de Contreras, who witnessed the Infantes' plotting firsthand.\"\n\nThe Archbishop of Toledo rises. His testimony carries immense weight - he's above factional politics, answerable only to Rome.\n\n\"Lords, I speak with great sorrow. In early May, I was appointed to the regency council to provide oversight during His Majesty's pilgrimage. I accepted this duty in good faith.\"\n\nHe pauses, collecting himself.\n\n\"On the third day after His Majesty's departure, I attended what I believed would be a routine administrative meeting. Instead, I witnessed the Infantes propose making the regency structure permanent.\"\n\nGasps. Duke of Medina Sidonia: \"Permanent? While the king still lived?\"\n\n\"The exact words were: 'We should propose to the November Royal Council that this regency structure become... permanent in essence, if not in name. Not as regents, of course, but as a formal Privy Council with binding authority over certain crown decisions.'\"\n\nThe Archbishop's voice hardens: \"Infante Juan specifically said: 'Our young cousin is devout, well-meaning, but he lacks the experience and temperament for sole rule.'\"\n\nInfante Juan flinches visibly. Seeing his own words quoted back by an Archbishop is devastating.\n\n\"Then Infante Juan said - and I remember this precisely - 'And speaking candidly, if our cousin returns from his pilgrimage with dangerous ideas about crusades or reforms, we'll already have the structure in place to moderate his enthusiasm.'\"\n\nThe chamber erupts. \"Moderate the Pope's crusade?\" someone shouts.\n\nThe Archbishop raises his hand for silence: \"I witnessed this with my own eyes, heard it with my own ears. This was not counsel offered to a king. This was conspiracy to usurp royal authority while the king sought divine guidance in Rome.\"\n\nHe turns to Juan, bows deeply: \"Your Majesty, when you appeared unexpectedly during that meeting - when you had returned early with your father's sword - it was the hand of Providence. God revealed their plotting before it could take root.\"\n\nThe Second Witness: Marquis de Santillana\n\nÍñigo López de Mendoza, Marquis de Santillana (the elder, not to be confused with his younger nephew in Juan's cabinet), rises next. He's about fifty, one of Castile's most respected nobles - a warrior, poet, and statesman.\n\n\"Your Majesty, lords, I also served on that regency council. I also witnessed the plotting the Archbishop described.\"\n\nHis voice is grave: \"But I can testify to more. In the weeks following His Majesty's dramatic return and removal of Infante Juan from the council, I remained in contact with both Infantes through correspondence.\"\n\nHe produces letters: \"These are from Infante Juan, written in late May and early June. Listen to this passage:\"\n\n\"'The young king grows increasingly unstable. This business with fetching his father's sword, claiming divine inspiration - it borders on madness. The realm cannot be governed by mystical visions. We must act decisively before he returns with whatever grandiose schemes Rome has filled his head with.'\"\n\nThe Marquis looks up: \"He calls his king mad. He dismisses the pilgrimage to Rome - the pilgrimage that resulted in the extraordinary papal bull we just heard - as 'grandiose schemes.'\"\n\nAnother letter: \"'We have six, perhaps eight major houses committed. The Military Orders waver. If we move quickly while he's still abroad, we can present the November Council with facts on the ground. Better to ask forgiveness than permission.'\"\n\n\"This, lords, is not counseling a wayward king. This is plotting rebellion. 'Facts on the ground' meant seizing fortresses. 'Ask forgiveness' meant presenting a coup as inevitable necessity.\"\n\nThe Marquis's voice fills with emotion: \"And what did our king return with? Not grandiose schemes. Not mystical madness. The blessing of the Pope himself. Tears of the Vicar of Christ. A crusade commission that will complete the Reconquista our ancestors died for. And these men called it madness. Called him unstable. While preparing armed rebellion.\"\n\nHe sits down heavily, visibly disgusted.\n\nThe Unexpected Third Witness - GREAT SUCCESS ELEMENT\n\nJust as Álvaro prepares to rest his case, a voice calls out:\n\n\"Your Majesty, might I speak?\"\n\nIt's Don Pedro Fernández de Velasco, Count of Haro - a man who entered this council leaning toward the Infantes. He's about forty-five, gruff military bearing, respected warrior.\n\nYou nod permission.\n\nDon Pedro stands, clearly struggling: \"Your Majesty, I... I was one of the twenty-three at Burgos. I attended the unauthorized assembly.\"\n\nThe chamber goes deathly quiet. This is a confession of complicity.\n\n\"I went because Infante Juan wrote to me. Said the realm needed guidance, that you were young and influenced by Álvaro. It sounded... reasonable. I thought I was attending a council of concerned nobles.\"\n\nHis voice hardens: \"But when I got there, when I heard what they were actually planning - seizing fortresses, preparing for your return as if you were an enemy - I left. I rode home that very night. I wanted no part of it.\"\n\nHe turns to the Infantes: \"I respected you. I thought you acted from concern for Castile. But you lied. You called us to Burgos under false pretenses. You used our respect for your names to cloak rebellion in legitimacy.\"\n\nBack to you: \"Your Majesty, I was wrong to attend even that first day. I ask your forgiveness. But I will testify under oath: what they planned at Burgos was rebellion. They spoke openly of 'containing' you, of 'managing' your return, of presenting the November Council with accomplished facts. They never intended fair counsel. They intended control.\"\n\nHe sits down, face flushed with shame and anger.\n\nTHIS is the Great Success element - one of their own supporters publicly breaking, not just withdrawing support but actively testifying against them. It's devastating.\n\nThe Chamber's Reaction\n\nMaster of Santiago (Luis de Guzmán, their ally) has gone pale. He can't defend this. The evidence is overwhelming, the witnesses unimpeachable.\n\nCount of Benavente stands: \"Your Majesty, I've heard enough. This is clear rebellion.\"\n\nDuke of Alba: \"Seizing royal fortresses while the king seeks papal blessing? Unforgivable.\"\n\nDuke of Medina Sidonia: \"And refusing lawful summons - refusing to answer to their king - that alone is treason.\"\n\nEven neutral nobles are nodding, murmuring agreement. The combination of documentary evidence, testimony from the Archbishop and Marquis, and now Don Pedro's confession has made this undeniable.\n\nSeveral nobles who entered sympathetic to the Infantes are now staring at them with betrayal in their eyes. They were used. The Infantes dressed up ambition as concern for the realm.\n\nMaster of Calatrava speaks carefully: \"The papal bull commands all Christians to submit to His Majesty's authority in the crusade. These men not only rebelled against their king - they rebelled against the Pope's chosen commander. That's not just treason against Castile. That's defiance of the Church itself.\"\n\nThis reframing is powerful. It's not just politics anymore - it's spiritual rebellion.\n\nThe Infantes' Moment\n\nÁlvaro bows to you: \"Your Majesty, the crown rests its case. The evidence is presented. I yield to the accused for their defense.\"\n\nAll eyes turn to the Infantes. Infante Juan rises slowly. His face is composed, but you can see the calculation in his eyes - he's trapped and he knows it.\n\nInfante Enrique remains seated, staring at his hands. He looks defeated already.\n\nThe chamber waits in tense silence. What can they possibly say? How can they defend against an Archbishop's testimony, written letters in their own hand, and a former supporter's confession?\n\nThis is their moment to respond. Do you want me to narrate what the Infantes say in their defense? Or would you prefer to interject or direct something before they speak?"

      "summary": "The Infantes' defense achieves a GREAT SUCCESS of its own — not by contesting the evidence, but by completely submitting. Infante Enrique weeps and begs forgiveness. Infante Juan, breaking from his script, drops to his knees and offers to renounce all claims, titles, and lands in exchange for joining the crusade as a common soldier. Juan seizes the moment brilliantly, drawing a parallel between his own renunciation before the Pope and the Infantes' submission. The Council finds the Infantes guilty of rebellion but Juan exercises mercy: no formal punishment due to safe conduct, but they must renounce all Castilian titles and serve the crusade to earn redemption. The nobles cheer.",

          "text": "The Infantes are in an extremely difficult position. Let me analyze their situation:\n\n**Their Position:**\n- Overwhelming evidence against them (documents, witnesses, confession from former supporter)\n- Chamber emotionally charged against them after papal bull\n- Nobles just pledged to the crusade\n- Archbishop and Marquis (unimpeachable witnesses) testified\n- Juan has momentum, papal backing, Portuguese marriage, international support\n- They're sitting in a room full of people who just experienced religious fervor\n\n**What They CANNOT Do:**\n- Deny the facts (too much evidence)\n- Attack Juan directly (he has papal blessing - that's sacrilege now)\n- Claim they were trying to help (Don Pedro exposed that lie)\n- Threaten Alfonso V's intervention (would look desperate and unpatriotic)\n\n**What They MIGHT Try (Infante Juan is clever):**\n1. **Admit wrongdoing but frame it as misguided concern** - \"We were wrong, but our intentions were to protect the realm\"\n2. **Separate themselves from each other** - Enrique might throw Juan under the bus, or vice versa\n3. **Appeal to mercy and the crusade** - \"Punishing us now weakens Castile before Granada\"\n4. **Offer something valuable** - Their troops, their fortresses, their submission\n5. **Play on nobles' fear of precedent** - \"Today it's us, tomorrow it could be you\"\n6. **Appeal to family ties** - They're Alfonso V's brothers, Juan's cousins\n7. **Frame it as Álvaro's doing** - Still try to drive wedge (but this is weak now)\n\n**Most Likely Strategy (Infante Juan):**\nHe's smart enough to know he can't win. His best bet is damage control:\n- Acknowledge wrongdoing honestly (claiming innocence is impossible)\n- Express genuine remorse (whether real or not)\n- Emphasize that they came here despite knowing they might be condemned (shows honor)\n\n- Propose a strategic redemption through total commitment to the crusade\n\nI see a calculated move to transform their disgrace into an opportunity. They'll leverage the religious fervor by offering unconditional service to Granada's campaign. By presenting themselves as penitent warriors willing to sacrifice everything, they hope to turn their potential condemnation into a path of redemption. It's a desperate but potentially clever political maneuver that could salvage some honor and political standing.\n\nTheir chances are precarious. Execution seems unlikely, but their dignity and independent authority are almost certainly lost. Juan's reputation for mercy provides a slim hope. By offering genuine submission and proving their loyalty through military service, they might secure a merciful sentence that allows survival but strips them of previous power.\n\nThe most probable outcome: public humiliation, formal condemnation, and mandatory service under Juan's strict command during the crusade. Their survival depends entirely on the quality of their submission and the sincerity of their proposed redemption.\n\nThe Infantes' Defense - Strategic Assessment\n\nInfante Juan stands, taking a long breath. He's a skilled politician, but you can see him calculating rapidly - every defense has been closed off. Let me assess his options:\n\nWhat He CANNOT Do:\n\nDeny the facts (too much evidence, including his own letters)\n\nAttack Juan (who has literal papal blessing - that's near-sacrilege now)\n\nClaim noble intentions (Don Pedro just exposed that lie)\n\nThreaten Alfonso V's intervention (would alienate everyone present)\n\nAppeal to legalism (refusing royal summons is indefensible)\n\nWhat He MIGHT Try:\n\nComplete admission of guilt with appeal to mercy\n\nSeparate Enrique from himself (sacrifice one to save one)\n\nOffer everything - troops, fortresses, wealth, service\n\nAppeal to crusade necessity (\"punishing us weakens Castile\")\n\nFrame it as misguided fear rather than ambition\n\nLean on his status as Alfonso V's brother (carefully)\n\nHis Best Play:\nTotal capitulation combined with offering value. He can't win the argument, so he needs to make his survival more useful than his punishment.\n\nInfante Juan's Defense\n\nHe looks around the chamber, then directly at you. When he speaks, his voice is measured, almost quiet - a stark contrast to his usual political smoothness:\n\n\"Your Majesty, assembled lords, I will not insult your intelligence with denials.\"\n\nThis opening surprises everyone. Several nobles exchange glances.\n\n\"The evidence presented is accurate. The letters are genuine. The Archbishop and Marquis witnessed exactly what they described. Don Pedro speaks truth about Burgos. I did these things.\"\n\nHe pauses, letting that sink in. It's a gamble - complete honesty might be his only card left.\n\n\"I will not claim I acted from pure concern for the realm, though I told myself that at the time. The truth is harder. I saw a young king - my cousin - departing on what seemed like... an impulsive journey. I saw Álvaro de Luna's influence. I saw opportunity.\"\n\nHis voice drops: \"I convinced myself I was protecting Castile. That I was being prudent, realistic. That someone needed to provide 'adult supervision.'\" He says the phrase with bitter self-mockery. \"But Don Pedro is right. I lied. To him, to others, to myself. What I called concern was ambition. What I called prudence was rebellion.\"\n\nInfante Enrique rises suddenly, his voice rough: \"Brother, let me speak.\"\n\nInfante Juan looks at him, surprised. Enrique addresses the chamber directly:\n\n\"My brother led, but I followed. I knew what we were doing. I helped seize Arévalo. I was there at Burgos. I'm as guilty as he is.\"\n\nThis is unexpected - Enrique refusing to let Juan take sole blame. There's something almost honorable in it.\n\nInfante Juan nods slowly: \"We were wrong. But more than that - we were fools.\"\n\nHe gestures toward you: \"We called him unstable. We dismissed his pilgrimage. We thought Rome would send him home with polite blessings and nothing more. We prepared to 'manage' his return.\"\n\nHis voice fills with something that might be genuine awe: \"And he returned with this.\" He gestures to the papal bull on the table. \"The Pope wept. The Pope wept at what he witnessed. Our cousin knelt naked before the Vicar of Christ and offered everything. And we called it madness. We called it grandiose schemes.\"\n\nSeveral nobles nod - this is hitting them. Infante Juan is essentially admitting that he underestimated Juan catastrophically.\n\n\"We are guilty of rebellion. Of treason. Of betraying our king while he sought to serve God. We deserve whatever judgment this council decrees.\"\n\nHe turns to face you directly:\n\n\"But Your Majesty, if you show mercy - if this council shows mercy - we offer everything we have. Every man in our service. Every fortress we hold. Every coin in our treasuries. We will fight under your command in the crusade. We will submit to your authority completely. Not as independent lords, but as your vassals, your servants.\"\n\nInfante Enrique adds: \"We came here knowing we might be condemned. We could have stayed in our fortresses, fortified, prepared for siege. We didn't. We accepted your safe conduct because... because somewhere in our plotting and scheming, we remembered we're Castilians too. And you're our king.\"\n\nInfante Juan's voice drops to almost a whisper: \"We were wrong. We failed. We betrayed you. But let us prove our worth in the crusade. Let us die fighting for Christ if that's what it takes to redeem ourselves. But let us die as Castilians, not as traitors in chains.\"\n\nHe falls silent, then adds one more thing - and this is the clever political move:\n\n\"Your Majesty has shown the realm what mercy looks like. You offered the converso communities protection. You promised surrendered Muslims fair treatment. You showed Granada's ambassador respect when you could have humiliated him. You've preached justice tempered with compassion.\"\n\nThe implication is clear without being stated: If you show mercy to infidels, can you not show it to erring Castilians?\n\n\"We throw ourselves on your mercy and the judgment of this council. We will accept whatever you decree.\"\n\nBoth Infantes kneel. It's formal submission - complete and public.\n\nAssessment of Their Defense\n\nProbability of Success: MODERATE\n\nWhat They Accomplished:\n\nAvoided looking ridiculous by not denying the undeniable\n\nShowed some honor by Enrique refusing to abandon Juan\n\nMade genuine-seeming admission of guilt\n\nOffered everything they have (troops, fortresses, wealth, service)\n\nCleverly invoked Juan's own mercy rhetoric\n\nAppealed to Castilian unity against Granada\n\nCame across as chastened rather than defiant\n\nThe kneeling is powerful symbolism\n\nWhat Works Against Them:\n\nEvidence is still overwhelming\n\nChamber is emotionally against them after papal bull\n\nMany nobles feel personally betrayed\n\nThe Archbishop's testimony can't be overcome\n\nThey still seized royal fortresses by force\n\nTheir submission only came after being cornered\n\nThe Nobles' Likely Reaction:\n\nSome will be moved by the honesty and submission\n\nSome will see it as skilled manipulation\n\nMost will look to Juan for guidance\n\nThe offer of service in crusade is tempting (adds ~5,000 troops)\n\nHarsh punishment might create martyrs; mercy shows strength\n\nBut complete forgiveness might look weak\n\nKey Question: What do the nobles value more - vengeance or utility? Punishment or pragmatism?\n\nThe chamber is silent, waiting. Some nobles look thoughtful. Others still look angry. A few - including Don Pedro, who confessed earlier - look conflicted.\n\nMaster of Calatrava glances at you, clearly wondering how you'll respond to this appeal to mercy.\n\nWhat do you do? Do you:\n\nAllow nobles to debate and vote on judgment?\n\nPronounce judgment yourself?\n\nAsk specific nobles for counsel first?\n\nSomething else?\n\nThis is a critical moment. How you handle defeated enemies will define your kingship as much as how you handle the crusade."

          "text": "The Infantes' defense rolled a GREAT SUCCESS. This is surprising and creates an interesting dynamic. They've genuinely moved the council with their honesty, submission, and appeal to mercy. Let me think about what this means:\n\n**What a Great Success accomplishes:**\n- The nobles are genuinely moved by the honest admission\n- The appeal to Juan's own mercy rhetoric resonates strongly\n- The offer of complete service in the crusade is very tempting\n- The chamber shifts from \"punish the traitors\" to \"perhaps mercy is wise\"\n- Even former opponents are reconsidering\n- The political calculation shifts - using them might be better than punishing them\n\n**What this doesn't mean:**\n- They're not innocent - everyone still knows they rebelled\n- Juan still has final authority\n- But the chamber is now advocating for mercy rather than punishment\n- This puts Juan in interesting position - he can be merciful from strength\n\n**Nobles who might speak:**\n- Duke of Medina Sidonia (influential, pragmatic)\n- Count of Benavente (earlier pledged support)\n- Master of Calatrava (represents Military Orders)\n- Don Pedro (the confessor - might feel kinship)\n- Archbishop of Toledo (moral authority)\n- Maybe even Álvaro (pragmatic about what serves the realm)\n\nLet me draft a response that shows the chamber genuinely moved, nobles speaking in favor of mercy, the political calculation shifting, but still leaving Juan with the decision. This is a great dramatic moment - the enemies who seemed doomed have turned the chamber's mood through honest submission.\n\nThe Council's Response - GREAT SUCCESS\n\nThe silence after the Infantes kneel stretches for long seconds. Then Duke of Medina Sidonia rises slowly. He's one of the most powerful men in Andalusia, and his word carries enormous weight.\n\n\"Your Majesty, assembled lords... I came here expecting to condemn traitors.\" His voice is thoughtful, almost reluctant. \"The evidence is overwhelming. The rebellion undeniable. But I cannot help but be moved by what I just witnessed.\"\n\nHe gestures toward the kneeling Infantes: \"They didn't deny. They didn't dissemble. They didn't make excuses or shift blame. They admitted everything - including that they were fools. That takes a kind of courage.\"\n\nCount of Benavente stands next: \"My lord of Medina Sidonia speaks truth. I've been in politics forty years. I've never seen a man admit fault so completely. Usually it's 'I was misled' or 'circumstances forced me' or 'it wasn't really rebellion.' They called themselves fools and traitors. They're right - but hearing them say it...\"\n\nMaster of Calatrava rises, his weathered face troubled: \"The papal bull commands us to crusade. We need every sword, every man, every coin. The Infantes offer five thousand troops, three fortresses, their entire treasuries. From a crusade perspective... we cannot easily dismiss that.\"\n\nMurmurs of agreement ripple through the chamber. The calculation is shifting - not from justice to mercy, but from punishment to pragmatism.\n\nDon Pedro Fernández de Velasco, who confessed earlier, speaks with visible emotion:\n\n\"Your Majesty, I was there at Burgos. I was almost complicit in this rebellion. You granted me mercy - allowed me to confess without punishment. If I deserved that mercy, if my confession earned redemption...\" He looks at the Infantes. \"Their confession is more complete than mine was. They kneel before you. They offer everything.\"\n\nHis voice cracks slightly: \"If you can forgive me, can you not forgive them?\"\n\nBishop of Córdoba stands, his ecclesiastical authority adding weight: \"Our faith teaches forgiveness. The prodigal son returned and was welcomed. Our Lord forgave those who crucified him. His Majesty himself has preached mercy - to conversos, to Muslims, to Granada's ambassador. Shall we show less mercy to erring Castilians than to infidels?\"\n\nThe religious framing is powerful. Several nobles nod.\n\nMarquis de Santillana rises - notably, he was one of the witnesses AGAINST them:\n\n\"I testified to their plotting because truth demanded it. I stand by every word. But...\" He pauses, wrestling with something. \"They are Alfonso V's brothers. Harsh punishment could mean war with Aragon. But more than that - His Majesty offered the Granada ambassador respect and gifts. He refused generous terms to follow God's will, but he treated his enemy with honor. These men are not enemies - they are Castilians who erred. If our king showed respect to the Sultan's envoy, surely we can show mercy to our own?\"\n\nDuke of Alba, voice gruff: \"Five thousand troops. Three fortresses. Complete submission. From a military standpoint, Your Majesty, we gain more by accepting their service than by punishing them. The crusade needs men. They're offering to die for Christ if that's what it takes. That's... that's not nothing.\"\n\nEven Álvaro de Luna rises, and this surprises everyone. The Infantes blamed him for everything, called him a low-born upstart corrupting the king. He has every reason to demand their destruction. But he speaks with careful control:\n\n\"Your Majesty, they rebelled partly because of me - because they saw my influence and resented it. I am not impartial. But...\" He pauses. \"The realm needs unity. The crusade needs strength. If punishing them satisfies justice but weakens Castile, and showing mercy satisfies mercy while strengthening Castile... I serve the realm. And the realm needs those five thousand men more than it needs vengeance.\"\n\nThis is extraordinary - Álvaro essentially putting aside personal grudge for pragmatic benefit. Several nobles look genuinely shocked.\n\nArchbishop of Toledo, who witnessed their plotting firsthand, rises with visible struggle:\n\n\"I testified against them. I saw their conspiracy. I was horrified by it.\" His voice is heavy. \"But I also just heard His Majesty's confessor say that our king struggled with discernment, with certainty, with knowing God's will. I heard that His Majesty made mistakes and learned from them.\"\n\nHe looks at the Infantes: \"They made mistakes. Terrible ones. But they came here. They accepted safe conduct. They could have fortified and fought. They didn't. That suggests... perhaps... the capacity to learn. To grow.\"\n\nThe Archbishop turns to you: \"Your Majesty, you are eighteen. You grew from uncertain youth to the man who moved a Pope to tears. Perhaps these men, who are princes and warriors but also human and flawed, can also grow. Perhaps mercy serves God's purpose better than punishment.\"\n\nThe chamber buzzes with energy. Nobles are speaking to each other in low voices, nodding, considering. The mood has shifted dramatically - from righteous judgment to thoughtful pragmatism mixed with genuine compassion.\n\nCount of Haro stands: \"Let them prove themselves in the crusade. Let them earn redemption with blood and service. If they fail, if they betray again, then punishment. But give them the chance to die well if they cannot live well.\"\n\nMaster of Santiago (Luis de Guzmán, their strongest supporter), rises with visible relief:\n\n\"Your Majesty, I... I supported them. Not in rebellion, but in friendship. I feared I would leave this chamber having lost friends and allies. But if mercy is possible...\" He looks at you with naked appeal. \"They offer complete submission. Accept it. Use them. Let them serve the crusade they tried to prevent.\"\n\nNearly two dozen nobles are nodding now. The tide has turned remarkably. They're not saying the Infantes are innocent - they're saying mercy is both righteous AND practical.\n\nDuke of Medina Sidonia speaks again: \"Your Majesty, I propose this: Accept their submission. Take their fortresses. Place your garrisons there. Take command of their troops. But let them serve as your vassals in the crusade. Let them prove their words with deeds. If they serve faithfully, their rebellion is forgiven. If they betray again...\" He leaves it hanging.\n\nVoices call out: \"Aye!\" \"Agreed!\" \"Mercy with conditions!\" \"Let them prove themselves!\"\n\nThe Archbishop of Seville rises and makes the sign of the cross:\n\n\"Your Majesty, the council has spoken. The evidence of rebellion is undeniable. But the plea for mercy is compelling. You stand where Christ stood - with the power to condemn or forgive. The council asks for mercy. But the judgment is yours alone.\"\n\nThe Chamber Awaits\n\nThe Infantes remain kneeling, heads bowed. Infante Enrique's shoulders are shaking slightly - perhaps with emotion, perhaps relief, perhaps shame.\n\nInfante Juan keeps his eyes closed, hands clasped in prayer position. He made his gamble and it worked - the chamber wants mercy.\n\nBut all eyes turn to you. The nobles have spoken, but you are the king. You wear the crown, carry the papal commission, bear your father's sword with its inscription: Non Nobis Domine.\n\nThe chamber waits in hushed anticipation. What judgment will you pronounce?\n\nThis is a defining moment. How you treat defeated enemies - enemies who admitted everything, who threw themselves on your mercy, who moved your nobles to plead for them - will be remembered as long as your reign lasts.\n\nWhat do you do?"

          "text": "Juan is creating a powerful parallel between his own renunciation before the Pope and the Infantes' submission. This is brilliant - he's essentially saying \"I gave everything to God, can you give everything to the crusade?\"\n\nHe's also not immediately accepting or rejecting - he's testing their commitment publicly. This puts them on the spot to either fully commit or back down.\n\nThe Infantes are kneeling, the chamber is hushed and moved. This is an incredibly charged moment. Juan is framing mercy not as weakness but as conditional on total commitment - matching his own total commitment.\n\nLet me write their response. They've already said they'll give everything, but now Juan is making it even more explicit, drawing the parallel to his papal renunciation. They basically have to say yes or lose everything.\n\nThis is not an action requiring a roll - this is dialogue, a moment of interaction. The Infantes will respond, and their response will be crucial.\n\nThe Test of Commitment\n\nYour words ring through the chamber like bells. The comparison is striking - you knelt naked before the Pope, offering everything. Now you're asking if they can match that sacrifice.\n\nThe Infantes remain kneeling. Infante Juan raises his head, and you see something in his eyes - perhaps fear, perhaps awe, perhaps recognition that this is the moment everything truly hinges on.\n\nInfante Enrique speaks first, his voice rough with emotion:\n\n\"Your Majesty, I am prepared to die. I've been a warrior my whole life. Death in battle doesn't frighten me. If the crusade takes my life, I die well. If it takes my wealth, what good is gold if my soul is damned? Every coin, every sword, every man in my service - take it all.\"\n\nHe looks up at you directly: \"But more than that. If you command me to serve as common soldier under your captains, I'll do it. If you strip me of titles and make me fight in the ranks with no honor but what I earn - I'll do it. I betrayed you. Let me pay that debt in Muslim blood and Christian service.\"\n\nInfante Juan rises to his knees, still not standing fully, but meeting your eyes:\n\n\"Your Majesty... cousin... when you knelt before the Pope, you had nothing to gain politically. You risked everything. You could have looked foolish. You could have been rejected. You offered yourself completely not knowing if it would work.\"\n\nHis voice trembles slightly: \"You're asking if we'll match that. If we'll truly offer everything without knowing if you'll accept it. If we'll risk total rejection and punishment after having confessed everything.\"\n\nHe takes a shaky breath: \"Yes. Every fortress, every man, every coin. My pride, my reputation, my very life. If you command me to serve as the lowest crusader in your army, I'll do it. If you command me to die in the first assault on Granada's walls, I'll climb those walls singing hymns. If you want my wealth for the crusade and my body as a shield for your soldiers - take it.\"\n\nHis voice breaks: \"You offered yourself to God through the Pope. I offer myself to God through you. You are His instrument. His chosen. The Pope wept and blessed you. I... I can only kneel and beg to serve.\"\n\nBoth brothers remain kneeling, but there's a shift in their posture - from political submission to something approaching religious supplication.\n\nInfante Enrique adds quietly: \"We don't deserve mercy. We deserve chains or execution. But if you grant mercy, we will earn it. Every day. Every battle. Until Granada falls or we die trying.\"\n\nInfante Juan: \"Non Nobis Domine. Not unto us, but unto Your name. Your father's sword bears those words. I adopt them now. Not for our glory. Not for our redemption. For Christ alone. If we serve the crusade, we serve Him. That's all that matters.\"\n\nThe chamber is utterly silent. Every noble watches this moment - two proud princes, warriors and politicians, brought to their knees and offering total submission not just politically but spiritually.\n\nThe Archbishop of Toledo makes the sign of the cross, visibly moved.\n\nÁlvaro de Luna watches carefully, his face unreadable but his eyes sharp. He's assessing whether this is genuine or theater.\n\nThe Infantes wait, still kneeling, for your judgment.\n\nWhat do you do?"

The chamber should react with enthusiasm. This is the unity moment everyone hoped for.\n\nLet me narrate this as the culmination of the council - the moment Castile truly unites.\n\nThe Reconciliation\n\nYour words carry through the chamber with absolute authority. The Infantes look up at you, and in that moment, you see genuine emotion break through their political masks.\n\n\"Stand up, cousins, so I may embrace you as family.\"\n\nInfante Enrique rises first, his warrior's bearing returning but transformed - not the prideful soldier-prince but something humbler. He steps forward and you embrace him. His arms wrap around you tightly, and you hear him whisper: \"Thank you. God bless you.

Te Dominum confitemur!\" (We praise Thee, O God! We acknowledge Thee to be the Lord!)\n\nThe Archbishop of Toledo joins, his powerful voice carrying: \"Te aeternum Patrem omnis terra veneratur!\" (All the earth doth worship Thee, the Father everlasting!)\n\nWithin moments, sixty-eight nobles, three Military Order Masters, multiple bishops, city representatives - all singing the ancient hymn of praise. The vaulted ceiling seems to amplify the sound, making it thunder through the chamber.\n\nDuke of Medina Sidonia crosses himself, tears in his eyes. Count of Benavente is openly weeping. Don Pedro Fernández de Velasco - who confessed his own near-complicity earlier - sings with his arms raised, face lifted toward heaven.\n\nEven Master of Santiago (Luis de Guzmán), who supported the Infantes and might have feared punishment himself, sings with relief and joy written on his face.\n\nThe Te Deum continues, verse after verse:\n\n\"Sanctus, Sanctus, Sanctus, Dominus Deus Sabaoth!\"\n\"Pleni sunt caeli et terra maiestatis gloriae tuae!\"\n\nÁlvaro de Luna watches with something approaching wonder. His greatest enemies just became crusaders serving under his king. The political brilliance of it is perfect - you gained everything (their troops, fortresses, submission) while appearing merciful and unifying. But beyond politics, there's something genuine here. The chamber feels it.\n\nWhen the hymn concludes, Duke of Alba shouts: \"Long live King Juan!\"\n\nThe cry is taken up immediately: \"LONG LIVE KING JUAN! LONG LIVE THE CRUSADE! NON NOBIS DOMINE!\"\n\nThe chamber shakes with it. Men are embracing each other, nobles who came uncertain are now committed, the energy is electric.\n\nCount of Haro steps forward: \"Your Majesty, Castile is united! Give us Granada!\"\n\nMore voices: \"For God and Castile!\" \"The Pope's chosen!\" \"The crusader king!\"\n\nThe Infantes' Final Response\n\nInfante Enrique kneels again, but this time not in submission - in fealty. He draws his sword, holds it by the blade, offers the hilt up to you in the ancient gesture of vassalage:\n\n\"Your Majesty, I, Enrique of Aragon, swear by Almighty God and all the saints that I am your man from this day forward. I will serve you in the crusade with all my strength, all my wealth, all my life if needed. I will obey your commands as Supreme Commander. I will defend your person and your crown. This I swear on my immortal soul.\"\n\nInfante Juan follows suit, kneeling beside his brother, drawing his own sword, offering it:\n\n\"Your Majesty, I, Juan of Navarre and Aragon, swear by Almighty God and all the saints that I am your man from this day forward. I will serve you in the crusade with all my strength, all my wealth, all my life if needed. I will obey your commands as Supreme Commander. I will defend your person and your crown. This I swear on my immortal soul.\"\n\nThe formal oath of vassalage. In front of the entire council. Unbreakable before God and man.\n\nThe Archbishop of Toledo steps forward to witness: \"These oaths are sworn before the Church and before this assembly. May God strike down any who break them.\"\n\nYou take each sword hilt in turn, accepting their fealty. The symbolism is perfect - they literally place their swords in your hands.\n\nTransition to the Ceremony\n\nThe Archbishop of Seville speaks, his voice still thick with emotion:\n\n\"Your Majesty, this council has witnessed confession, judgment, mercy, and reconciliation. We have witnessed Castile unite for holy purpose. But the people of Seville wait outside. They've heard the hymns. They know something extraordinary happened. Should we not show them what we've accomplished here?\"\n\nÁlvaro de Luna adds practically: \"Your Majesty, the crusaders wait in the cathedral plaza. The banner and relics are prepared. The clasps have been blessed. This seems the proper moment.\"\n\nHe's right. The council has accomplished everything you hoped for and more. Now it's time for the public display - the ceremonial conclusion where you award crusader clasps before the people.\n\nDuke of Medina Sidonia: \"Let all Seville see what we've witnessed. Let them see princes kneel, nobles unite, and crusaders blessed. Let them see the white banner and the True Cross!\"\n\nThe chamber buzzes with agreement. Men are ready to process outside, to transform this private reconciliation into public celebration.\n\nThe Moment Before\n\nBefore you move to leave the chamber, Infante Juan speaks quietly, just for you:\n\n\"Cousin, you could have destroyed us. You had every right. Every justification. The council would have supported it. But you showed wisdom I didn't believe an eighteen-year-old could possess.\"\n\nInfante Enrique adds: \"We will fight for you. Not because we must. Because you earned it. Today. Right now. You earned our loyalty.\"\n\nThe Archbishop of Toledo approaches, places his hand on your shoulder:\n\n\"Your Majesty, in thirty years serving the Church, I've never seen a king handle power with such grace. Justice without cruelty. Mercy without weakness. You judged rightly, showed compassion, gained loyalty, and united the realm - all in one moment.\"\n\nHe lowers his voice: \"Pope Martin V wept when you knelt before him. I understand why now. God's hand is upon you.\"\n\nÁlvaro de Luna catches your eye and gives the slightest nod. No words needed. He's telling you: Perfectly done.\n\nThe council chamber doors stand ready to open. Beyond them, the cathedral plaza where 151 crusaders wait under your white banner, where the True Cross and Santiago's bone shine in their reliquaries, where thousands of Sevillanos have gathered, hearing the hymns and waiting to see what emerges.\n\nYou stand at the threshold between the political triumph inside and the public celebration outside. Behind you, former enemies now sworn as allies. Before you, a crusade to launch.\n\nAre you ready to process outside for the ceremonial awarding of the crusader clasps? Or is there anything else you wish to do or say in this chamber before the public ceremony?"

          "text": "This should feel like the culmination of everything - the journey from Rome, the Florence speech promise fulfilled, the unity achieved, the crusade now real and visible.\n\nI should describe:\n1. The procession from chamber to plaza\n2. The crowd's reaction\n3. The banner and setup\n4. Juan clasping himself first (supreme commander)\n5. Each commander individually with personality\n6. The chaplains with their book clasps\n7. Andrea as first crusader (emotional callback to his trembling first oath in Barcelona)\n8. The progression through all crusaders\n9. The crowd's growing fervor\n10. The final impact\n\nThis is a SUCCESS result for the action of conducting the ceremony powerfully and effectively.\n\nThe Ceremony of the Clasps\n\nThe chamber doors swing open and the procession begins. You lead, followed by the Infantes (now your sworn vassals), then the nobles in order of rank, the Military Order Masters, the bishops and archbishops, city representatives - the entire council flowing out into the November sunlight.\n\nThe Plaza Scene\n\nThe Plaza de San Francisco is packed. At least ten thousand people - perhaps more - fill every available space. They've been waiting for hours, hearing hymns from inside the Archbishop's palace, sensing something momentous.\n\nWhen you emerge, a roar goes up that seems to shake the cathedral stones.\n\nIn the center of the plaza, exactly as planned:\n\nThe White Banner stands twelve feet tall, the silk glowing in afternoon sun. The gold reliquary holding the True Cross fragment blazes like captured fire. The silver reliquary with Santiago's bone shines beside it. The banner moves slightly in the breeze, the white fabric rippling like something alive.\n\nThe 151 Crusaders stand in formation around it - white tabards with red crosses blazing against their armor, shields bearing the same colors, arranged in precise ranks. They look like an army of saints.\n\nAt a table beside the banner: Diego with his careful records and the wooden cases containing the clasps. He stands at attention, looking nervous but proud.\n\nThe crowd parts as you walk forward, the nobles spreading out behind you in a great semicircle. The crusaders snap to attention. The banner seems to glow brighter.\n\nYou reach the table, and the plaza falls silent - ten thousand people holding their breath.\n\nThe Supreme Commander\n\nYou take the Supreme Commander's clasp from its velvet-lined case. The silversmith outdid himself - silver-gilt with your father's sword engraved in fine detail, Non Nobis Domine inscribed along the blade, a circle of garnets around the edge catching the light like drops of holy blood.\n\nYou pin it to your tunic over your heart. The gesture is simple but profound - you're marking yourself as first crusader, first servant, bearing the greatest responsibility.\n\nThe crowd erupts. \"THE CRUSADER KING! NON NOBIS DOMINE! NON NOBIS DOMINE!\"\n\nYou let them chant for a moment, then raise your hand for silence. They quiet immediately, desperate to hear.\n\nThe Commanders\n\nYou call forth each commander by name:\n\n\"Captain Fernán Alonso de Robles!\"\n\nFernán steps forward, still wearing the road dust from his intelligence mission. When you pin the bronze commander's clasp to his tunic - the cross with its aureole of divine favor - his weathered face shows pure pride. He salutes crisply, then bows deeply.\n\n\"For your loyal service and your steadfast command,\" you say clearly enough for the front rows to hear. \"May God guide your sword.\"\n\n\"Acting Captain Rodrigo!\"\n\nRodrigo approaches, clearly emotional. You remember him as Corporal Rodrigo, one of the two guards who stayed with you at the hermitage when you circled back to catch the Infantes plotting. Now he commands the crusader company. When you clasp him, his eyes shine with tears. \"Your Majesty, I will not fail you.\"\n\n\"Sergeant García!\"\n\nGarcía - the other guard from that night, proven loyal through everything. His clasp pins beside scars from a dozen campaigns. He grins fiercely: \"For God and Castile, Your Majesty.\"\n\n\"Sir Thomas Beaumont!\"\n\nThe English knight steps forward with martial grace. When you clasp him, you say: \"You came as hired sword and became brother in arms. Thank you, Sir Thomas.\" His voice is thick: \"The honor is mine, Your Majesty.\"\n\n\"Marco Tornesi!\"\n\nThe former mercenary from Florence, now training sergeant. When you pin his clasp, you remember him as first of the four who rode so hard from Florence to catch you in Barcelona. He's found redemption in service. \"Your Majesty,\" his voice cracks, \"I finally fight for something worth dying for.\"\n\nEach clasping draws cheers from the crowd. They're watching their king honor his warriors one by one, and the crowd loves it.\n\nThe Chaplains\n\n\"I call forth the chaplains of the crusade!\"\n\nFray Hernando de Talavera leads them - your confessor, your spiritual guide. Behind him: Brother Tomás Rodríguez (the Kind, pastoral care), Father Miquel Serra (the learned Dominican who speaks Arabic), Father Alfonso de Palencia (the stern Benedictine), Brother Juan Sánchez (the practical secular priest).\n\nYou hold up one of the silver chaplain clasps - the book design gleaming in the light.\n\n\"These men bear different marks,\" you announce to the crowd. \"Not the cross of warriors, but the book of learning and faith. They answer to God alone, not to commanders. They may enter any part of camp, speak to any man, report directly to the Church. They are the conscience of this crusade.\"\n\nYou pin Fray Hernando first. The monk's eyes are closed, lips moving in prayer. When you finish, he opens his eyes: \"I will keep your soul as safe as the crusaders keep your body.\"\n\nEach chaplain receives his clasp with solemn dignity. The crowd murmurs approvingly - a crusade with priests who can check the warriors' conduct, that speaks well of the enterprise.\n\nBrother Guillem steps forward with the \"learned crusaders\" - soldiers who provide spiritual support without being ordained. Their clasps combine cross and book. \"You walk between two worlds,\" you tell them. \"Warrior and scholar, sword and prayer. Keep both sacred.\"\n\nThe First Crusader\n\nYou turn to Diego: \"Who was the first crusader to take the oath?\"\n\nDiego consults his careful records, though of course you both know the answer: \"Your Majesty, Andrea Vescovi. He took the oath at dawn on August 19th in Barcelona, first of four that morning.\"\n\nYou call out: \"Andrea Vescovi! First crusader, come forward!\"\n\nThe crowd murmurs - who is this Andrea Vescovi? Some important knight?\n\nFrom the crusader ranks emerges Andrea - tall, gangly, barely twenty years old, still looking like the awkward farm boy he was four months ago. But he's filled out with training, his face more confident, wearing his white tabard and red cross with pride.\n\nHe steps forward trembling - not from fear but emotion. He remembers that morning in Barcelona, touching the True Cross and Santiago's bone for the first and last time, weeping with overwhelming grace. Now the king himself calls him forward before ten thousand people.\n\nYou hold up the simple iron clasp - cross design with \"GRANADA\" beneath. No silver, no garnets, just honest iron. But it gleams.\n\n\"Andrea Vescovi, you were first to kneel before the banner and swear yourself to this crusade. You left your farm, your family, everything you knew, to serve God and fight for Christ. You trained hard. You've learned to be a soldier. You've become a crusader.\"\n\nYou pin the clasp to his tabard, right over his heart.\n\nAndrea's face crumples. Tears stream down his young face. He tries to speak, can't, just bows deeply again and again. When he straightens, he manages: \"Thank you, Your Majesty. I... I won't let you down.\"\n\n\"I know you won't, Andrea. You're exactly the kind of man this crusade needs.\"\n\nThe crowd roars approval. They love this - a farm boy honored equally with knights, given the first crusader clasp. It says something about what this crusade is: service before birth, faith before rank.\n\nThe Procession of Crusaders\n\n\"Giovanni Rossi!\"\n\nThe blacksmith with the limp and missing fingers, one of the original four. Simple faith and fierce devotion. When you clasp him, he weeps openly.\n\n\"Pietro Aldobrandini!\"\n\nThe merchant's son, youthful enthusiasm matured into real commitment. He kneels to receive his clasp, then kisses your hand.\n\n\"Marco Tornesi!\" - wait, you already clasped Marco as commander.\n\nDiego corrects: \"Your Majesty, Marco was fourth of the original crusaders but already received his commander's clasp. The next in order is Alonso Fernández.\"\n\n\"Alonso Fernández!\"\n\nThe professional soldier from Barcelona, day three recruit. Receives his clasp with military precision.\n\nOne by one, you work through them. Diego calls each name from his records. Each crusader steps forward. You pin their clasp. Each has a moment before their king.\n\nSome weep. Some salute. Some kiss the clasp first. Some kneel. Each reacts according to their nature, but all share one thing: absolute commitment.\n\n\"Tomás García!\" - The converso proving his faith. His hands shake as you clasp him.\n\n\"Brother Guillem!\" - The Benedictine monk-warrior, already clasped with the learned crusader's special design.\n\n\"Pedro Álvarez!\" - Border veteran, rough but experienced. Grins fiercely.\n\nAfter twenty, thirty, forty crusaders, your fingers ache from pinning clasps. But you don't delegate. Each man deserves this moment. Each earned it.\n\nThe crowd watches mesmerized. They're seeing their king honor every single crusader personally, from farm boys to knights, treating each with equal respect.\n\nAround crusader number seventy, your voice grows hoarse from calling names. Fray Hernando quietly offers you water. You drink, then continue.\n\n\"Miguel Cardona!\" - Pere de Cardona's nephew, minor nobility who didn't have to join but did. Represents the Cardona family's commitment.\n\n\"Felipe Ruiz!\" - Wait. Ruiz. Like Isabel's family. You glance at the man - no relation you can see, but the name catches you for just a moment. You push the thought away and clasp him.\n\nThe Final Crusaders\n\nAs you approach the end - crusaders 140, 145, 150 - the energy in the plaza is electric. The crowd has watched you personally honor 150 men, one by one, for nearly two hours. The sun is lowering toward evening.\n\n\"Rafael Sánchez!\" - Crusader 151, the last one. A young Sevillan, joined just days ago after your plaza speech. Fresh-faced, nervous, honored beyond measure.\n\nYou pin his clasp: \"You are the newest crusader, but you stand equal to the first. Welcome, Rafael.\"\n\nHe bows so deeply he nearly falls over.\n\nThe Moment of Unity\n\nYou turn to face the crowd, the 151 crusaders arrayed around the banner behind you, each wearing their clasp, white tabards blazing, shields gleaming.\n\nYou draw your father's sword - Non Nobis Domine catching the light. You raise it high:\n\n\"SOLDIERS OF CHRIST! ARE YOU READY TO MARCH?\"\n\n151 voices thunder: \"YES, YOUR MAJESTY!\"\n\n\"WILL YOU FOLLOW ME TO GRANADA?\"\n\n\"YES, YOUR MAJESTY! TO GRANADA! TO VICTORY!\"\n\n\"FOR GOD AND CASTILE!\"\n\n\"FOR GOD AND CASTILE!\"\n\nThe crowd takes up the cry: \"FOR GOD AND CASTILE! NON NOBIS DOMINE! THE CRUSADE! THE CRUSADE!\"\n\nTen thousand voices shaking the plaza. The banner ripples as if stirred by divine wind. The True Cross blazes. The crusaders pound shields against the cobblestones in rhythmic thunder.\n\nThe Archbishop of Seville raises his arms, blessing the entire assembly:\n\n\"Go forth with God's blessing! Go forth as soldiers of Christ! May the Lord bless you and keep you! May His face shine upon you! May He grant you victory and bring you safely home! In nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti! AMEN!\"\n\n\"AMEN!\" Ten thousand plus 151 plus 68 nobles plus all the bishops and priests - the whole plaza united in that single word.\n\nThe Aftermath\n\nAs the formal ceremony concludes, the plaza becomes celebration. People surge forward to touch the banner, to see the relics, to embrace the crusaders. Merchants appear with wine. Musicians start playing. It's spontaneous festival.\n\nThe Nobles' Reactions:\n\nDuke of Medina Sidonia approaches you: \"Your Majesty, I've been in many ceremonies. Never seen anything like that. Two hours honoring each crusader personally. They'll die for you now.\"\n\nCount of Benavente: \"You kept the promise from Florence - awarding clasps in order. That Andrea boy, the farm lad honored first... brilliant. Shows this crusade is for everyone.\"\n\nMaster of Santiago (Luis de Guzmán): \"Your Majesty, the Santiago Order has 2,000 knights. After today... I think many will want these clasps. They'll want to be part of this.\"\n\nThe Infantes approach together. Both still look emotionally raw from the council. Infante Juan speaks:\n\n\"Cousin, we watched you clasp 151 men personally. Not delegated. Not rushed. Each one honored. We saw soldiers weeping when you pinned their clasps. We saw farm boys standing beside knights as equals.\" He pauses. \"We were fools to oppose you. This... this is how you build an army that will follow you to hell itself.\"\n\nInfante Enrique adds: \"When do we receive ours? We're crusaders now. We swore it.\"\n\nYou realize - you haven't clasped the Infantes yet. They swore fealty, committed to the crusade, but weren't part of the ceremony.\n\nWhat do you do? Do you clasp the Infantes now, privately, or save it for a future moment? The plaza celebration continues around you. The crusaders mingle with the crowd. The banner glows in the setting sun. This day has been an unqualified triumph - council united, Infantes sworn, crusaders honored, public inspired.\n\nWhat happens next?"

You will certainly need to because that will be the very first question father Hernando will ask you. Did you truly join in your hearts or did you join merely to avoid prosecution?

Testing their sincerity - giving them a way out if they were just performing politically\n3. Establishing that the crusader vows require genuine spiritual commitment (Fray Hernando's confession requirement)\n4. Treating them like any other recruit - they must go through the proper process\n5. Showing wisdom by giving them time to truly consider\n\nThis could have several effects:\n- Shows the nobles he's principled (keeps his word even when it might be disadvantageous)\n- Forces the Infantes to truly commit or back out (if they back out, they look weak; if they commit for real, it's genuine)\n- Demonstrates that crusader status isn't just political theater - there are real spiritual requirements\n- Protects Juan from accusations of forcing them under duress\n\nThe Infantes' reactions would be complex:\n- They just made huge public oaths and declarations\n- Being told \"go think about it\" is almost more challenging than immediate acceptance\n- They can't back out now without looking terrible\n- But Juan's giving them the chance anyway, which is both merciful and shrewd\n- They're being held to the same standard as Andrea the farm boy\n\nLet me write this response showing:\n1. The Infantes' initial reaction (surprise, perhaps some respect)\n2. The nobles observing this exchange\n3. The Infantes' choice in the moment\n4. What this means for their position\n\nThe Challenge of Grace\n\nThe Infantes freeze. Both clearly expected to receive their clasps immediately - the culmination of their dramatic oath, the seal on their reconciliation. Instead you're offering them... an exit?\n\nInfante Juan's face cycles through emotions rapidly - surprise, calculation, then something that might be respect mixed with discomfort:\n\n\"Your Majesty... we swore oaths before the entire council. Before God and the assembled nobility. Before the Archbishop himself witnessed our fealty.\" His voice is careful. \"Are you suggesting those oaths were... hasty? Made under duress?\"\n\nInfante Enrique looks almost offended: \"Cousin, we knelt before you. We offered everything. We meant every word.\" Then he pauses, hearing your point. \"But you're right that we haven't been confessed. We haven't been tested like your crusaders were.\"\n\nÁlvaro de Luna, standing nearby, watches this exchange with sharp interest. He sees what you're doing - giving them rope to either hang themselves or prove genuine.\n\nDuke of Medina Sidonia murmurs to Count of Benavente: \"Clever. He gives them what they asked for - to be treated like true crusaders - which means going through the same process as everyone else.\"\n\nInfante Juan takes a long breath: \"You're holding us to the same standard as that farm boy. As the merchant's son. As the Florentine mercenary seeking redemption.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" you say simply. \"Andrea Vescovi confessed with Fray Hernando before taking his oath. Marco Tornesi opened his heart completely. Every one of these 151 men was spiritually screened. Why should princes be exempt from what farm boys must endure?\"\n\nThe Archbishop of Toledo approaches, having overheard: \"Your Majesty is wise. The crusader's oath is sacred. It must be freely chosen, not extracted under political pressure. Even if that pressure comes from one's own mouth before a council.\"\n\nInfante Enrique nods slowly: \"You're giving us the chance to walk away. To say 'we made those oaths politically, to avoid punishment, but we don't truly mean them in our hearts.' And you'll honor your safe conduct even if we do.\"\n\n\"I am a man of my word,\" you say. \"Safe conduct means safe conduct. If you leave Seville tomorrow, ride to your estates, and never speak of crusading again - I will not pursue you. Your oaths before the council satisfied justice. Whether you become crusaders is between you and God.\"\n\nInfante Juan laughs - a short, bitter sound: \"And if we refuse now, after that performance in the council chamber? After we wept and swore and offered everything? We'd look like calculating cowards who said whatever was necessary to save our necks. Our reputations would be destroyed. Every noble in Castile would mock us.\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" you acknowledge. \"But better to look like cowards than to swear false oaths before God. Better to be honest about political calculation than to treat crusading as theater.\"\n\nThe trap - if it is a trap - becomes clear to everyone watching. You've given them what seems like freedom, but that freedom itself is a test. They can:\n\nWalk away and be seen as political cowards who faked everything\n\nGo through proper recruitment and confession, proving genuine commitment\n\nTry to skip the process and demand immediate clasping, revealing they see crusading as political prize rather than spiritual calling\n\nMaster of Calatrava watches with visible approval. Several nobles are nodding - they're seeing a young king who won't let princes skip the requirements commoners must meet.\n\nInfante Enrique speaks first: \"I will present myself at the recruitment place. I will confess with Father Hernando. I will answer his questions honestly. And if he judges me unworthy - if my heart is not pure enough - I will accept that judgment.\"\n\nHis voice is firm: \"Not because I have to. Because you're right. I made those oaths in the heat of shame and fear. I need to know if I mean them when I'm calm. When there's no crowd watching. When it's just me and God.\"\n\nInfante Juan looks at his brother, then at you: \"You've given us more respect than we deserve. Most kings would have forced immediate public clasping - sealing our submission before we could reconsider. You're giving us the chance to truly choose.\"\n\nHe bows: \"I will also present myself for recruitment. I will confess. I will open my heart to your chaplain. And I will earn my clasp the same way Andrea Vescovi earned his - through genuine commitment examined by someone who answers to God alone.\"\n\nBoth brothers step back. The moment of high emotion has been deliberately broken, replaced with something harder and more honest.\n\nFray Hernando approaches you quietly: \"Your Majesty, that was... you continue to surprise me. Most would have clasped them immediately, sealed their submission while emotions ran high. Instead you gave them time to reconsider. That's genuine mercy, not political theater.\"\n\nHe glances at the Infantes: \"They'll present themselves tomorrow or the day after. I'll hear their confessions. I'll ask the hard questions. If they're genuine, I'll accept them. If they're performing... well, that's between them and their souls.\"\n\nThe Archbishop of Seville speaks up, loud enough for the nearby nobles to hear: \"His Majesty demonstrates true wisdom. Sacred vows require clear minds and pure hearts. Even princes - especially princes - must meet the same spiritual standards as common crusaders. This is what makes a holy army, not merely a political coalition.\"\n\nDuke of Alba nods approvingly: \"The farm boy and the princes go through the same door. That's justice.\"\n\nThe Infantes Depart\n\nThe two brothers bow formally, then begin withdrawing through the crowd. You notice nobles watching them carefully - some sympathetic, some calculating what this means for their own positions.\n\nBefore they leave, Infante Enrique turns back: \"Cousin, one question. When we present ourselves at recruitment... do we bring our retinues? Our household knights? Or do we come alone?\"\n\nIt's a good question. They each have ten men with them in Seville, and hundreds more in their households. Are those men also becoming crusaders? Or just the princes themselves?\n\nWhat do you answer?\n\nMeanwhile, the plaza celebration continues. Musicians play. Wine flows. The 151 clasped crusaders are being mobbed by well-wishers and young men asking how to join. Diego looks overwhelmed coordinating recruitment inquiries.\n\nThe white banner glows in the setting sun. The True Cross and Santiago's bone shine like captured stars. This day - November 8, 1430 - will be remembered as long as Castile exists.\n\nIs there anything else you wish to do during this celebration? Or shall we move forward in time to see what happens next with the Infantes' recruitment, the kingdom's response to the council, and preparing for the actual crusade campaign?"

Whatever \"leadership\" role you offer won't be as Prince of Aragon or potential King of Navarre, but as a crusader commander earning his place through service.\n\n\"I understand, Your Majesty. My men are sworn to me personally. When you call, they'll come. And I...\" he pauses, choosing words carefully, \"I will serve wherever you place me. If that means leading men, I'm grateful. If it means fighting in the ranks, I'll do that too.\"\n\nInfante Juan looks more troubled. Renouncing titles is one thing in the heat of the moment; understanding what that actually means is another. But he nods:\n\n\"My household knights are at your disposal when the crusade marches. As for me... I'll present myself for recruitment as any man would. Whatever role you assign after that, I'll accept.\"\n\nBoth bow and withdraw into the crowd.\n\nÁlvaro de Luna approaches once they're out of earshot:\n\n\"Your Majesty, a clarification for my records. The council found them guilty of rebellion. You granted safe conduct, so no immediate punishment. But if they simply leave Seville and never return to serve in the crusade...\"\n\nHe's asking what the legal status is. Are they pardoned? Or still guilty rebels who happen to be temporarily protected by safe conduct?\n\nSeveral nobles nearby lean in slightly, also wanting to understand this precisely. Duke of Medina Sidonia in particular looks curious about how you're threading this needle.\n\nWhat do you tell Álvaro and the listening nobles about the Infantes' legal status?"

If they honor their commitments - join the crusade, renounce titles, serve faithfully - that service could constitute their punishment. If they ride away and never return, they are fugitive rebels with outstanding judgment against them.\"\n\nHe makes a note: \"I'll record it precisely. Guilty verdict rendered, safe conduct honored, sentencing pending based on their actions. Clean. Enforceable.\"\n\nDuke of Medina Sidonia speaks approvingly: \"Wise, Your Majesty. You've given them a path to redemption while maintaining the crown's authority. If they serve well, the rebellion becomes... a grave error corrected through holy service. If they flee, every noble in Christendom will know they're oath-breaking cowards.\"\n\nMaster of Calatrava adds: \"And if they do join genuinely, serve faithfully? Their military experience would be valuable. Infante Enrique especially - he's a skilled battlefield commander.\"\n\nCount of Benavente: \"The waiting is the test. A few days to think, to confess, to decide if they truly mean their oaths. We'll know their character by whether they appear at recruitment.\"\n\nThe Archbishop of Toledo approaches with pastoral concern:\n\n\"Your Majesty, might I suggest something? When - if - they present themselves to Fray Hernando, perhaps I should be present as well? These are princes, complex men with political calculations mixed into spiritual matters. Having a second senior churchman witness their confessions and spiritual examination...\"\n\nHe's offering support for Fray Hernando, who might find examining royal princes spiritually daunting.\n\nDiego hurries over, looking slightly overwhelmed:\n\n\"Your Majesty, we have forty-three new inquiries for crusader recruitment just from today's ceremony. Young men saw the clasps, heard the oaths, want to join. And three minor noble houses sent representatives asking about bringing their household troops when the crusade marches.\"\n\nHe consults his notes: \"Also, the converso community sent a delegation. They want to make a formal donation to the crusade and ask if conversos can serve as crusaders. They said...\" he reads carefully, \"they want to prove their Christian faith through holy service.\"\n\nThe plaza celebration continues around you. The sun is setting now, painting the white banner golden. The 151 crusaders mingle with civilians, telling stories, showing their clasps with pride. Wine and food appear from somewhere - Seville celebrating spontaneously.\n\nFray Hernando stands near the banner, already in conversation with several young men who want to know about recruitment. You see him gesturing, explaining, likely describing the spiritual requirements.\n\nWhat do you wish to do? Address any of these immediate matters? Or shall we move forward in time to see what happens in the coming days - whether the Infantes appear for recruitment, how the kingdom responds to the Council's results, and the practical work of preparing for the crusade campaign?"

He clearly expected to be included in examining princes of royal blood, but he accepts the boundary you've set:\n\n\"As Your Majesty commands. Fray Hernando is your chosen confessor and spiritual examiner. I will not interfere with his process.\"\n\nHe pauses, then adds more warmly: \"Though I confess, I'm curious to see how a humble monk handles examining men who thought themselves above royal authority just hours ago. It will be... instructive for them.\"\n\nDiego makes quick notes: \"Yes, Your Majesty. Physical assessment with Rodrigo and the commanders, then spiritual examination with Fray Hernando. Same process for everyone - converso, noble, or prince.\"\n\nHe looks up: \"The converso delegation will be pleased. Several of their young men are quite capable. Tomás García has been one of our best - his family will be proud others can follow.\"\n\nÁlvaro de Luna adds quietly: \"Accepting conversos openly will strengthen your support in the cities. The merchant communities especially. And it sends a clear message - this crusade judges men by faith and capability, not bloodline.\"\n\nThe Evening Draws On\n\nThe plaza celebration continues as darkness falls. Torches are lit around the banner, making the white silk glow against the night sky. The True Cross and Santiago's bone catch the firelight, seeming almost to pulse with their own radiance.\n\nYou notice Andrea Vescovi, the first crusader, surrounded by young Sevillans asking him what it's like to serve in the crusade. The farm boy who could barely speak four months ago is now telling stories, showing his iron clasp with pride, describing the training and brotherhood.\n\nMarco Tornesi has a small crowd of his own - men with military experience wanting to know about the physical requirements.\n\nBrother Guillem is in deep conversation with three young men who look like they might be students or minor clergy - explaining the learned crusader path.\n\nThe 151 are naturally becoming recruiters themselves.\n\nCaptain Fernán approaches: \"Your Majesty, it's been a long day. The crusaders should rest, and you've been standing for hours. Might I suggest we secure the banner and relics for the night? Station guards?\"\n\nHe's right - you've been on your feet since dawn, through the council meeting, the reconciliation, and two hours of clasping 151 men individually. The adrenaline is fading and exhaustion setting in.\n\nWhat do you wish to do? Retire for the evening? There's also the matter of where the banner and relics will be kept - the cathedral? The royal palace? Somewhere else?\n\nOr is there someone specific you want to speak with before the day ends? The celebration will continue in the plaza for hours yet, but you need not stay for all of it."

For the first time all day, his careful political mask drops completely. He looks exhausted but exhilarated.\n\n\"Relieved? Your Majesty, I was certain at least three times today that everything would collapse.\" He crosses to pour himself wine as well, though he drinks more slowly. \"When you announced the Portuguese betrothal immediately - before I could properly frame it - my heart stopped. When you had the entire bull read aloud, I thought 'this is either brilliant or catastrophic.' And when the Infantes made that plea...\"\n\nHe sits heavily in a chair, shaking his head with something between admiration and disbelief:\n\n\"You gambled everything on momentum. No careful negotiation, no private deals beforehand, just... direct action. Portuguese marriage, Aragonese diplomacy, papal bull, trial, judgment, mercy, public ceremony - all in one day. It was reckless.\"\n\nHe raises his cup in salute: \"It was also the most masterful piece of political theater I've ever witnessed. You didn't just unite the realm - you made them want to unite. You turned a trial into a revival meeting.\"\n\nHe drinks, then sets down his cup and looks at you seriously:\n\n\"But Your Majesty... we both know today was performance as much as substance. The nobles pledged support while swept up in religious fervor. The Infantes swore oaths while cornered. Tomorrow, when emotions cool, when men think rather than feel - that's when we'll discover if today actually changed anything or if it was just... a beautiful moment that fades.\"\n\nHis voice drops: \"Those two princes could walk out of Seville tomorrow and never return. And your safe conduct means you can't stop them. They'd be fugitive rebels, yes, but they'd be free fugitive rebels. Did we win their loyalty today? Or just buy a temporary truce?\"\n\nHe's not criticizing - he's voicing the fears he couldn't express in public.

Or does Carlos remain heir?\n\nIn medieval succession law, this is complex:\n- If a father renounces for himself, it doesn't always eliminate his children's claims\n- But if he explicitly renounces on behalf of his line, that could eliminate descendants\n- The exact wording of the renunciation matters\n\nThe Infantes said they \"renounce all claims and titles\" before the council. But did they explicitly renounce on behalf of their descendants?\n\nI should have Álvaro point out:\n1. The renunciation's exact scope is crucial\n2. Carlos, Prince of Viana (Infante Juan's son) might still have a claim unless explicitly renounced\n3. There might be other siblings or relatives in the Aragonese royal family\n4. This could actually be a massive strategic gain for Juan II if he can truly eliminate the Infantes from succession\n\n5. The ultimate validity hinges on Alfonso V and the Aragonese council's acceptance of the renunciation.\n\nThe political maneuvering reveals Juan's intricate strategic thinking, carefully navigating complex familial and legal terrain to secure his political position.\n\nThe Succession Question\n\nÁlvaro de Luna goes very still, his wine cup halfway to his lips. He sets it down slowly and stares at you.\n\n\"Your Majesty... I was so focused on the immediate - getting them to submit, preventing civil war, securing their troops - that I didn't think through the full implications of their renunciation.\"\n\nHe stands and begins pacing, his mind clearly racing:\n\n\"Infante Juan is King of Navarre and has a son - Carlos, Prince of Viana, about nine years old. Infante Enrique has no legitimate children that I know of. So the succession question is...\"\n\nHe counts on his fingers: \"Alfonso V has no children with your sister María after years of marriage. If he dies without heir, succession would normally pass to his brother Juan, then to Juan's son Carlos, then to Enrique.\"\n\nHe turns to face you: \"But if Juan and Enrique both renounced their claims before the council - before sixty-eight witnesses, the Archbishop, everyone - and if those renunciations are taken seriously...\"\n\nHis voice drops with the weight of it: \"Carlos might still inherit through his father's line. Unless Juan's renunciation included his descendants. Did he say 'I renounce' or 'I and my line renounce'?\"\n\nÁlvaro crosses to the door, opens it, and calls for Diego: \"Bring me the council records. Now.\"\n\nHe turns back to you: \"Your Majesty, if we can establish that they renounced not just personally but for their entire lines... if Alfonso V dies without heir and both brothers are bound by those renunciations witnessed by the Church...\"\n\nHe doesn't finish the sentence, but the implication hangs heavy: Aragon would need a new heir. And who would that be?\n\n\"There might be other relatives,\" he adds carefully. \"Distant cousins, cadet branches. But the direct line would be broken. The Crown of Aragon - Aragon, Catalonia, Valencia, the Italian possessions - suddenly without clear succession.\"\n\nHe looks at you with something approaching awe: \"Did you plan this?

BUT if done before witnesses in a specific way, with Church sanction, it might be binding\n\nÁlvaro would know the legal precedents here. He'd be cautious about overreaching - claiming too much might provoke Alfonso V or other powers. But he'd also see the opportunity.\n\nI should have Álvaro analyze this carefully, considering:\n- What exactly was said\n- Legal precedents\n- How Alfonso V would interpret it\n- Whether pushing this claim would help or hurt\n- The practical politics vs. the legal theory\n\nAnd importantly - I should NOT put words in Juan's mouth or generate his dialogue. Only Álvaro's response and questions.\n\nLegal Analysis\n\nÁlvaro de Luna stops pacing and looks at you with a mixture of respect and concern:\n\n\"Your Majesty, that's both brilliant and dangerous. The comparison to your papal renunciation was inspired - it backed them into offering everything. But now we need to determine exactly what 'everything' means legally.\"\n\nHe sits back down, thinking carefully:\n\n\"Traditional feudal law is clear: a father cannot renounce inheritance rights on behalf of his children. Carlos, as Prince of Viana and Infante Juan's son, has his own independent claim to Navarre and to the Aragonese succession. Juan could abdicate for himself but not for his bloodline.\"\n\nHe pauses, then adds: \"However... the words matter enormously. If Juan said 'I renounce all claims and titles' - that's personal. If he said 'I and my line renounce' or 'I renounce for myself and my descendants' - that's binding on Carlos. If he said something ambiguous like 'everything' or 'all that I am' - we'd need Church lawyers to interpret it.\"\n\nDiego arrives with the council records. Álvaro spreads them out, reading quickly:\n\n\"Here - during the defense, Infante Juan said: 'We offer everything we have. Every fortress, every man, every coin. My pride, my reputation, my very life.'\"\n\nHe continues reading: \"Then during the oath of vassalage: 'I, Juan of Navarre and Aragon, swear by Almighty God and all the saints that I am your man from this day forward...'\"\n\nÁlvaro looks up: \"He identified himself as 'of Navarre and Aragon' even while swearing vassalage. That complicates things - he's acknowledging those identities while submitting to you.\"\n\nHe sets down the documents: \"The practical question: even if we could argue his renunciation extends to his line, would pressing that claim help or hurt us?\"\n\nHe ticks off considerations:\n\n\"If we claim it extends to Carlos:\n\nProvokes Alfonso V enormously - we're declaring his nephew has no succession rights\n\nCreates succession crisis in Aragon and Navarre\n\nOther kingdoms would question whether we're overreaching\n\nBut it eliminates future threats from that bloodline\n\nIf we don't claim it extends to Carlos:\n\nJuan remains personally bound but his son could still inherit\n\nLess threatening to Alfonso V\n\nMore legally defensible\n\nBut in twenty years, Carlos could be King of Navarre and Aragon, remembering his father's humiliation\n\nThe middle path:\n\nTreat the renunciation as binding on Juan and Enrique personally\n\nRemain ambiguous about descendants\n\nLet that question be resolved when Alfonso V actually dies\n\nBy then, circumstances might favor us - or we might want different terms\"\n\nHe looks at you carefully: \"Your Majesty, what was your intent when you drew that parallel to your papal renunciation?

The key distinction: \n   - If a man renounces and enters holy orders BEFORE having children, any future children would be illegitimate (clergy can't marry) and couldn't inherit\n   - If a man with existing legitimate children enters holy orders, those children's rights were usually preserved because they were established BEFORE the renunciation\n   - The children inherit the titles the father HELD, not what he renounces - so if father was duke and renounces, children still inherit dukedom\n\n4. There's a critical difference between:\n   - Renouncing what you currently possess (affects you, not necessarily heirs)\n   - Renouncing claims to future succession (more complex)\n   - A holistic renunciation of \"everything\" including bloodline claims\n\nIn this case:\n- Infante Juan is already King of Navarre\n- He has a son, Carlos, who is Prince of Viana\n- Carlos's claim exists independently as the legitimate son of a king\n- But if Juan renounced \"everything\" in a way that mirrors taking holy orders...\n\nÁlvaro would point out that the legal precedents are mixed, and much depends on:\n1. Exact wording\n2. Whether the renunciation was voluntary or coerced\n3. Church interpretation\n4. Political realities\n\nJuan is essentially asking if he can use the holy orders precedent to argue that the Infantes' renunciation extends to their children. Clever thinking.\n\nThe Holy Orders Question\n\nÁlvaro de Luna immediately grasps where you're going with this. He sets down his wine and leans forward:\n\n\"That's a clever parallel, Your Majesty. When a man with sons takes holy orders - becomes a monk or priest - the law is complex but there are precedents.\"\n\nHe thinks aloud: \"If a Duke has a legitimate son, then enters a monastery and renounces worldly possessions... the son still inherits the duchy because the son's right existed BEFORE the father's renunciation. The father cannot retroactively unmake his son's legitimate claim.\"\n\nHe pauses: \"However - and this is crucial - if that Duke renounces not just his current holdings but his claims to future succession, that's different. For example, if he was also heir to a kingdom he hadn't yet inherited, his entry into holy orders would eliminate his place in that succession line. But would it eliminate his son's?\"\n\nÁlvaro pulls at his beard thoughtfully:\n\n\"The Church lawyers argue both ways. Some say the son's claim flows through the father - if the father is removed from succession by holy vows, the line is broken. Others say the son has independent bloodright that cannot be affected by the father's choices.\"\n\nHe looks at you sharply: \"But here's what matters practically: The Infantes offered everything in the context of joining a crusade. They didn't take monastic vows, but they did renounce 'everything' including titles and claims to serve God through you as the Pope's chosen commander.\"\n\nHis voice drops: \"We could argue that serving in a papal crusade, with complete renunciation witnessed by archbishops, is functionally equivalent to taking holy orders. That they dedicated themselves and their lines to divine service, removing themselves from worldly succession entirely.\"\n\nHe stands, excited now: \"It's not airtight legally. Church lawyers could debate it for years. But we have:\n\nThe papal bull giving you supreme authority\n\nMultiple archbishops witnessing their renunciation\n\nTheir own words about offering 'everything'\n\nThe parallel to your papal renunciation - which the Pope blessed\n\nThe fact it was done voluntarily before the entire council\n\nWe could make the case that their entire lines are eliminated from Aragonese succession because they dedicated themselves completely to holy crusade.\"\n\nHe pours more wine, thinking: \"But Your Majesty, pressing your own claim to Aragon? That's... ambitious doesn't cover it. Alfonso V is your sister's husband. He's alive and healthy. And even with the Infantes removed, there might be other relatives with claims.\"\n\nHe meets your eyes: \"Are you thinking long-term - planting seeds for decades from now?

Using the Infantes' renunciation to position himself as potential heir\n3. Framing it as mutual benefit to Alfonso V\n4. Thinking in grand strategic terms about facing Ottomans and North African powers\n\nÁlvaro would be analyzing this carefully. He needs to:\n- Assess the realism of this plan\n- Consider the political obstacles\n- Think about how Alfonso V might view this\n- Evaluate whether this helps or hurts their immediate situation\n- Consider if this is visionary or overreach\n\nÁlvaro is politically sophisticated. He'd see both the brilliance and the dangers here. He'd also need to think about his own position - if Juan becomes King of Aragon too, that changes everything.\n\nLet me have Álvaro respond thoughtfully, analyzing the different angles, being honest about both opportunities and risks.\n\nStrategic Vision and Reality\n\nÁlvaro de Luna sits back, studying you carefully. There's a long silence as he processes what you've just revealed. When he speaks, his voice is measured:\n\n\"Your Majesty, you're eighteen years old and thinking in terms of empires and dynasties. That's... remarkable. Most young kings think about the next battle, the next harvest, the next noble dispute. You're thinking about the shape of Iberia itself.\"\n\nHe stands and walks to the window, looking out over nighttime Seville:\n\n\"A united Castile and Aragon would indeed be formidable. Combined, we'd have the entire Iberian Peninsula except Portugal - and you're marrying into Portugal. The resources, the manpower, the strategic position... yes, we could face the Ottomans. We could project power into the Mediterranean and Africa.\"\n\nHe turns back: \"But Your Majesty, let me be blunt about the obstacles.\"\n\nHe counts on his fingers:\n\n\"First: Alfonso V is thirty-four years old and healthy. He could live another thirty years. Are you prepared to wait three decades for this crown? You'd be nearly fifty before inheriting Aragon, if it happens at all.\n\nSecond: Alfonso has no children with your sister after years of marriage, true. But he could take another wife if María dies, or if the Pope grants annulment. He could still produce an heir.\n\nThird: Even with the Infantes removed, there ARE other relatives. The House of Trastámara has cadet branches. Distant cousins with their own claims. Alfonso could designate any of them.\n\nFourth: The Catalans are fiercely protective of their privileges. The Aragonese parliament - the Corts - guards its powers jealously. They might refuse to accept a Castilian king, seeing it as conquest rather than inheritance.\n\nFifth: Approaching Alfonso now, while his brothers are sitting in Seville having just renounced everything... it could look like you engineered their humiliation specifically to position yourself as heir. That would poison any relationship with him.\"\n\nHe pauses, then adds more thoughtfully:\n\n\"However... there's a path where this could work. Not now, but over years.\"\n\nHe sits back down: \"The long game:\n\nFirst: Complete the Granada crusade successfully. Prove yourself as warrior-king and strategic thinker. That builds your reputation across all Christian kingdoms.\n\nSecond: Maintain excellent relations with Alfonso. Support his Italian ambitions as you offered. Send troops, ships, money when he needs it. Make him see you as valuable ally, not threat.\n\nThird: Keep María as your advocate. She's his wife, your sister. She could quietly plant the idea that you'd make a good heir - strong, capable, already family through marriage.\n\nFourth: Wait for the right moment. If Alfonso remains childless after five, ten, fifteen years... if his Italian campaigns drain Aragon's resources and he needs Castilian support... if the Infantes prove troublesome even in crusader service... THEN broach the succession question.\n\nFifth: Frame it as his idea. Make Alfonso feel like designating you as heir gives him leverage, prestige, a powerful alliance. Never make it seem like you're grasping for his crown.\"\n\nÁlvaro drinks deeply, then continues:\n\n\"The Infantes' renunciation helps, but it's not enough by itself. Alfonso could ignore it, name other heirs, or father children. What we've really done today is eliminate the strongest rival claimants. That's valuable. But claiming Aragon requires Alfonso's cooperation, the Corts' acceptance, and years of relationship-building.\"\n\nHe meets your eyes seriously: \"Your Majesty, this is a vision worth pursuing. But it's a twenty-year project, not a five-year one. Can you be patient? Can you build the relationship with Alfonso slowly, without pushing too hard too fast?\"\n\nHe pauses, then asks the crucial question: \"And what happens if, after all that work, Alfonso fathers a son ten years from now? Or designates someone else? Will you accept it? Or will this vision consume you until you're willing to do... darker things... to make it happen?\"\n\nHis voice drops: \"Because Your Majesty, the difference between visionary statesman and dangerous tyrant is often just patience and knowing when to let go of dreams that cannot be.\""

He would indeed be the heir apparent to both Navarre (through his father) and potentially Aragon (if Alfonso V dies without children).\n\nÁlvaro should provide this information and discuss the implications.\n\nThe Heir Question\n\nÁlvaro de Luna nods approvingly at your measured response:\n\n\"Patience and relationship-building. Good. That's the path of a wise king, not a grasping one.\"\n\nHe considers your question about Carlos:\n\n\"Carlos, Prince of Viana, is nine years old. His mother was Blanche of Navarre - she died in childbirth with him, which is why Infante Juan rules Navarre alone now as King.\"\n\nHe taps the table thoughtfully:\n\n\"So the succession situation currently looks like this:\n\nIf Alfonso V dies tomorrow without children:\n\nTraditionally, Infante Juan would inherit Aragon\n\nBut Juan just renounced claims before the council\n\nDoes that make young Carlos the heir? Or does it skip to Enrique?\n\nOr if both brothers' renunciations are binding, who then?\n\nThe boy is nine years old. Álvaro emphasizes this. \"He's being raised in Navarre, educated as a prince, probably doesn't even know his father and uncle just renounced everything in Seville. In another ten years he'll be a man with his own ambitions.\"\n\nHe looks at you seriously: \"Your Majesty, that boy represents both threat and opportunity. If his father's renunciation doesn't bind him, Carlos could inherit Navarre and Aragon, becoming immensely powerful. If the renunciation DOES bind him, he's eliminated from succession and might become a bitter enemy.\"\n\nÁlvaro pours more wine: \"But there's another possibility. Carlos is nine. You're eighteen. If you build good relations with Aragon over the next decade, if you complete the Granada crusade, if you prove yourself... when Carlos is nineteen and you're twenty-eight, you could be his ally. Perhaps even his mentor.\"\n\nHe pauses: \"Or, if his father's renunciation is upheld and Carlos finds himself with no kingdom to inherit... you could offer him a place. A command in your armies. A wealthy marriage. Turn potential enemy into grateful ally.\"\n\nHe sets down his cup: \"But all of this is speculation. First, the Infantes need to actually appear for recruitment. Then they need to serve faithfully in the crusade. Then we see how Alfonso V reacts to his brothers' renunciation. Then... well, then we have years of careful diplomacy ahead.\"\n\nHis expression softens: \"Your Majesty, today was a triumph. The council united. The Infantes submitted. The crusade has momentum. Let's not lose sight of the immediate victory by worrying too much about crowns that might not come for decades.\"\n\nHe raises his cup: \"To today's success. And to patience in pursuing tomorrow's ambitions.\"\n\nThe exhaustion is finally catching up to both of you. It's been an extraordinarily long day - from the tense morning meeting with the Infantes, through the dramatic council session, the trial, the reconciliation, and two hours of personally clasping 151 crusaders.\n\n\"Your Majesty, you should rest. Tomorrow brings its own challenges. We'll need to see if the Infantes actually appear for recruitment. We'll have to start organizing the actual crusade campaign - supplies, recruitment expansion, military planning. And Portuguese Princess Isabel will arrive in about a month for the wedding.\"\n\nHe stands: \"But tonight, savor this. You turned potential civil war into unity. You gained the Infantes' submission without bloodshed. You inspired the realm. That's a remarkable day's work.\"\n\nDo you wish to discuss anything else with Álvaro tonight? Or shall we move forward in time to see what happens next?"
