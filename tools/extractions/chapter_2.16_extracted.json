Don Ramon is displeased that Juan has been meeting faction leaders and the bishop without consulting the regency council. Juan apologizes and shares his full vision of bringing the kingdoms together without either holding dominance. He asks about the Aragonese succession. Don Ramon explains that Juan is Alfonso's heir presumptive, as all closer male relatives are dead. Roll 42 (Cautiously Receptive): Don Ramon acknowledges Juan's transparency without endorsing the vision, answers the succession question factually, and suggests further discussions should include Maria and the full council.",

Don Ramon explains that assembling all members requires time and Maria's consent. Juan agrees to defer all succession talk to the council and refers merchants' questions to Don Ramon. Don Ramon briefs Juan on the Consell de Cent's concerns about trade competition before escorting them to the midday reception. Juan and Lucia then attend the Consell de Cent meeting at the Saló de Cent. The hundred jurats, led by Conseller en Cap Pere Joan de Sant Climent and merchant representative Bernat Fiveller, probe Juan's intentions regarding Granada's ports and Catalan trade privileges. Juan engages honestly, admitting Castile's naval weakness and promising consultation. The merchants press for concrete commitments.",

Lucia drafts the letter as Juan dictates five provisions: Military Orders to focus anti-piracy efforts on Salé with Aragonese coordination; equal treatment for Aragonese, Portuguese, and Castilian merchants in Castilian ports; Granada's governor to prevent silk market disruption; a policy of informing Portuguese and Aragonese traders about tax changes; and encouraging Barcelona to host an international traders' conference. Juan turns the tables by asking the Consell for reciprocity, exposing that they cannot commit Aragon-wide policy. Barcelona commits to equal treatment for Castilian merchants in its port. Juan signs the letter. The Consell acclaims him with 'Visca el rei!' Don Ramon notes the significance, and Juan downplays it. Don Ramon departs to brief Maria.",

Juan offers to visit Alfonso after Rome, speak on behalf of the council with their blessing, and carry any message they draft. Roll 9 (Frustrated Disappointment): Pallars is bitterly disappointed, saying Juan offers to carry letters when he has 40,000 florins of leverage, a fleet, and papal favor. He departs coldly.

Juan approaches the widow himself, who reveals she lost both husband and son. She thanks him for the prayers - no one had spoken their names in church in three years. Juan waves to Maria, who is crying in a side chapel. She acknowledges him with a nod - not warmth, but no longer cold.

When Don Guillem begins presenting trade agreements, Viscount Rocaberti attacks Juan for signing the Consell de Cent letter without consulting the council. Juan respectfully waits for Maria to allow him to speak, then addresses the challenge directly: the letter instructed his own officials in his own kingdom and benefited Aragonese merchants. Roll 98 (Critical Success - Rocaberti overplayed): Maria herself rebukes the Viscount for questioning a sovereign king's right to instruct his own officials, calling it an insult under her authority. Juan's credibility is enhanced. Pallars gives him a barely perceptible nod of approval.",

Roll 59 (Mixed Reception): Don Guillem sees commercial opportunity, Pallars hears echoes of Naples, Bardaxi presses on practical concerns for Aragonese merchants and shipping. Bardaxi asks three pointed questions about protecting Catalan vessels from friendly fire, evacuating Aragonese subjects if Constantinople falls, and providing warning if Castile withdraws. Juan answers each directly, promising protection for Aragonese subjects and fleet support for evacuation. The council requests written commitments. Juan agrees but then asks for reciprocity - Aragonese aid in evacuation too. When Maria says the council cannot commit Alfonso's military resources but offers a strong recommendation, Juan declines the arrangement, recognizing it would corner Alfonso. He proposes discussing it directly with Alfonso so both kings can sign together. The council is stunned by his voluntary surrender of leverage. Maria notes: 'You could have had us in a corner.

Juan offers his assessment: the letter will achieve nothing because Alfonso believes he can win in one year, similar to Juan's own Granada endgame. Juan commits to visiting Alfonso personally and counseling him to conclude the war. The council votes 4-1 in favor of sending the letter (Pallars, Bardaxi, Bishop of Girona, Rocaberti for; Don Guillem against; Maria abstains).

Juan silences them and focuses on solutions: securing the Hospital de la Santa Creu for the 60 sick men, sourcing replacement meat supplies, resolving the command structure. He sends riders to Tarragona and Tortosa for 250-300 barrels of salt meat, plans resupply stops at Rome and Naples, and orders full rations restored immediately. He demands the commanders choose one subordinate commander and one quartermaster by the next day, or he will appoint them. Juan personally inspects latrines, arranges fresh water barrels, and asks Maria to help feed the men. Roll 69 (Strong Success): The hospital welcomes the sick as an honor, Maria generously opens palace stores for a feast ('You are not the only one who can take care of family, brother'), fresh water flows, camp hygiene improves dramatically, and a feast of roasted meat, lamb, bread, cheese, and wine restores the men's spirits. Juan returns to the palace exhausted, visits sleeping Catalina, and sings her a lullaby.",

The three commanders present their unified proposal: Commander Mendoza (Calatrava) as overall commander, citing his experience leading combined forces at Antequera; Sergeant Tomas de Palencia (Alcantara) as unified quartermaster, the man who predicted the spoiled meat and warned about camp placement; Commander Cervantes (Santiago) as Mendoza's second. Juan accepts. He orders Mendoza to ensure every man is properly equipped, with Alcantara's requests filled first. Quartermaster Palencia reports: riders reached Tarragona, 120 barrels available; word sent to Tortosa for 40-60 more. Total expected by March 5: approximately 240 barrels. Juan sets departure for March 5. The campaign has begun.",

Captain Diego de Sotomayor gives a full tour: the queen's chambers (fitted for Isabel, who never saw them, now Lucia's); the king's cabin; the great cabin for councils; the main deck with three masts capable of eight knots; the gun deck with twelve bombards ('not a warship, but she can fight'); the hold with three months' stores; and the forecastle fighting platform. Catalina asks 'Where is Constanti-popple?' and demands to see the cannons boom. The chapter concludes with a comprehensive summary of all events: the political triumph at the Consell de Cent, the painful Pallars meeting, Maria's reconciliation through family, the regency council with Rocaberti's rebuke and the Naples letter vote, Catalina's character traits, and the military crisis resolved through leadership and Maria's generosity. The fleet prepares to depart March 5 for Rome, Naples, and Constantinople.",
