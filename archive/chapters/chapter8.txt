Spain Roleplay 1433 - Book 2
/
Hi, 

This is chapter 2.8. Read the project files to learn what is going on. 

What do I see?

22 nov 2025

Reconstructed narrative timeline and positioned scene opening








The morning light of June 2nd, 1433 filters through the leaded windows of your chamber in the merchant's house. You have risen early—the instinct of a campaigner who spent eighteen months in the field does not fade easily.

Your traveling clothes are laid out by a servant: the practical garments of a man who intends to ride hard, not the silks of diplomatic audience. Your small traveling party waits below—thirty-three crusaders remaining after seventeen departed with the Byzantine delegation yesterday evening, their white tabards bright against the gray of Basel's streets as they headed east toward Constantinople with Metropolitans Bessarion and Isidore.

Through the window, you can see the cathedral spire rising above the rooftops. Somewhere in that vast building, the Council continues its deliberations—the four deputations grinding through procedural votes, the French and Germans circling each other like wary dogs, Cardinal Cesarini struggling to hold the whole enterprise together. Your Castilian delegation remains: Abbott Rodrigo, Bishop Alfonso de Cartagena, Fray Hernando. They will continue the work here.

The roads south are open. Emperor Sigismund was crowned in Rome on May 31st—two days ago—and will now be making his way north. If you ride hard, you can intercept him somewhere in the Italian Alps or the Swiss cantons. The Emperor who signed himself "perhaps in purpose" awaits meeting the king who actually completed a crusade.

Captain Robles appears at your door, armor gleaming in the morning light. "Your Majesty. The horses are ready. Abbott Rodrigo and Fray Hernando are waiting below—they wish to bid you farewell."

The chamber is quiet. Your letters to Álvaro de Luna and Emperor John VIII are already on their way to Castile and Constantinople. What remains is the road, the meeting with Sigismund, and then—God willing—home to Toledo before Isabel's time comes.

What do you do?

I go and speak with my delegation before I leave. 

Abott, do you think you can continue our work in the council while I travel to Toledo?

22 nov 2025

Orchestrated scene setup with delegation members and crafted Abbott's realistic response




The main hall of the merchant's house is modest but well-appointed—dark wood panels, a fire crackling against the morning chill that lingers even in June this far north. Your delegation has gathered near the hearth.

Abbott Rodrigo González stands with the aid of a walking stick, his seventy-three years showing more heavily than when you first met him in Rome three years ago. Eight months in Basel have worn him thin. Beside him, Bishop Alfonso de Cartagena waits with his customary composed expression. Fray Hernando stands slightly apart, his Franciscan robes plain against the merchant's finery—your confessor's eyes watchful, as always.

At your question, Abbott Rodrigo inclines his head. The firelight catches the deep lines around his eyes.

"Continue, Your Majesty? Yes. We will continue." He pauses, choosing his words with the care of a man who has spent decades in church politics. "But I would have you understand what 'continue' means in this place."

He gestures vaguely toward the cathedral.

"The German cardinals are sincere—they will push for the crusade decree. Bishop Alfonso's addresses still command respect. Fray Hernando's counsel is sought by Cardinal Cesarini himself. We have built something here. Castile's voice matters."

The old abbot's expression darkens slightly.

"But the French will block any meaningful crusade authorization. They see Constantinople as a distraction from their true goal—reducing the Pope to a figurehead. And the procedural machinery..." He shakes his head. "Four deputations. Endless amendments. We measured it, Your Majesty. The electoral reform decree took six months from proposal to passage. Six months for a document about how to choose bishops."

He meets your eyes directly.

"What would you have us accomplish while you are gone? I will not promise what this Council cannot deliver."

I hope you can pass the crusade decree, mirroring what the pope will pass. Continue with meaningful reforms we have discussed. 

I will ask the pope to adopt the exact text of the council decree on plusalist reform and pass the crusade decree as well. Hopefully this will bring both factions together. 

Keep in communication with Castille and me as best as possible. If needed, I will visit again. I will send you the outcome of my meeting with emperor Sigismund.

22 nov 2025

Orchestrated diplomatic delegation response to departure instructions



Abbott Rodrigo listens carefully, nodding slowly as you outline your strategy. When you finish, something shifts in his weathered face—not quite hope, but perhaps the shadow of it.

"Parallel texts. Pope adopts Council language, Council mirrors papal decree." He exchanges a glance with Bishop Alfonso. "It is... elegant, Your Majesty. If it works, neither side can claim the other usurped authority. Both save face. Both act."

Bishop Alfonso speaks up, his tone measured. "The pluralist reform decree is already passed. Session Twelve. If His Holiness adopts that text verbatim, it would be unprecedented—a Pope ratifying conciliar legislation without amendment. The symbolism alone..." He trails off, considering. "It could change everything. Or it could change nothing, if either side refuses to see it as cooperation rather than surrender."

"We will try," Abbott Rodrigo says simply. "The crusade decree, we will push. The Germans are with us. Some Italians. But Your Majesty should know—" He hesitates, then continues. "The roll of the dice has already fallen against us on timing. The procedural obstacles are severe. If the decree passes at all, it may be months after your departure."

Fray Hernando steps forward. His voice is quieter than the others, meant for you alone but audible to all.

"You go to meet an Emperor, and then home to your wife. Both are right and necessary." His dark eyes hold yours. "Remember what we discussed. The three questions. Pray on them daily, even on the road. Especially on the road, when you are far from anyone who will challenge you."

He pauses.

"I will write to you. And I expect honest letters in return—not reports of triumph, but truth about your heart. Can you promise me this?"

Fray Hernando, I was actually hoping you would accompany us home and then on to Constantinople. The choice is yours, but I hope you come with me so you can continue to do your work as my confessor and advisor. What do you choose?

22 nov 2025

Weighed spiritual duty against diplomatic obligations, ultimately prioritizing confessor role








Fray Hernando's expression shifts—surprise, then something more complex. He turns to look at Abbott Rodrigo and Bishop Alfonso, a silent conversation passing between the three men.

Abbott Rodrigo speaks first, his voice dry. "You would take my most valuable counselor, Your Majesty. Cardinal Cesarini will be... disappointed."

"The Cardinal will survive," Bishop Alfonso says quietly. "I can manage the theological debates. It is what I do." He looks at Fray Hernando. "The question is where you are most needed, brother."

Fray Hernando is silent for a long moment. The fire crackles. Outside, you can hear horses stamping in the courtyard, your escort preparing for departure.

When he speaks, his voice is measured.

"I came to Basel because you sent me, Your Majesty. I stayed because the work was good and necessary. But my work..." He pauses, choosing his words with care. "My work has always been your soul. Not church politics. Not reform decrees. You."

He looks toward the window, toward the cathedral spire visible above the rooftops.

"Constantinople. You will go to the edge of Christendom, to a dying empire, carrying the weight of their hopes. Every man there will look at you as a savior. Every success will whisper that you are God's chosen instrument." His eyes return to yours, sharp and searching. "That is precisely when you need someone who will tell you the truth."

He turns to Abbott Rodrigo. "Can you manage without me?"

The old abbot snorts. "I managed church politics before you were born, brother. Alfonso and I will hold the line. Go. Keep our king's feet on the ground."

Fray Hernando nods slowly, then faces you again.

"I will come. But understand what you are asking. I will not soften my words because we are far from home. I will not spare you because emperors are watching. If anything, I will be harder on you, because the temptations will be greater."

He extends his hand—not to shake, but palm up, waiting.

"Promise me. Daily confession on the road. Honest examination. No hiding behind the press of events. Can you accept these terms?"

GM: Is the demand for daily confessions really realistic here? Juan will not be pressured for extra confessions either way, but I just want to make sure this is not a made up drama.

23 nov 2025

Scrutinizing fifteenth-century confession practices for historical accuracy



You're absolutely right - daily confession is not realistic medieval practice and would be theatrically excessive rather than authentic spiritual direction. Let me revise:

Fray Hernando is silent for a long moment. The fire crackles. Outside, you can hear horses stamping in the courtyard, your escort preparing for departure.

When he speaks, his voice is measured.

"I came to Basel because you sent me, Your Majesty. I stayed because the work was good and necessary. But my work..." He pauses, choosing his words with care. "My work has always been your soul. Not church politics. Not reform decrees. You."

He looks toward the window, toward the cathedral spire visible above the rooftops.

"Constantinople. You will go to the edge of Christendom, to a dying empire, carrying the weight of their hopes. Every man there will look at you as a savior. Every success will whisper that you are God's chosen instrument." His eyes return to yours, sharp and searching. "That is precisely when you need someone who will tell you the truth."

He turns to Abbott Rodrigo. "Can you manage without me?"

The old abbot snorts. "I managed church politics before you were born, brother. Alfonso and I will hold the line. Go. Keep our king's feet on the ground."

Fray Hernando faces you again.

"I will come. On one condition—that you continue the work we began. The three questions. Daily prayer on them. And when you need confession or counsel, you actually seek it rather than carrying burdens alone because emperors are watching."

He extends his hand.

"Will you accept your confessor at your side for this journey?"

Of course Hernando. I have missed your council and presence. Glad to have you on my side again. 

I say my goodbye to the delegation and visit the Greeks and the crusaders who will travel with them as well.

23 nov 2025

Reconciled timeline discrepancy; Byzantine delegation departed yesterday




Fray Hernando takes your hand firmly. Something eases in his expression—not quite a smile, but relief. "Good. I have missed being able to speak plainly with you as well. Basel is full of careful words and calculated gestures. I am glad to return to simpler work."

Abbott Rodrigo bows, stiff but sincere. "Go with God, Your Majesty. We will hold your banner here. And..." The old man's voice softens slightly. "Give the Queen our prayers. May she be safely delivered."

Bishop Alfonso adds, "We will write with any developments. And we await word of your meeting with the Emperor."

You step outside into the courtyard, but Captain Robles intercepts you before you reach the stables.

"Your Majesty—the Byzantine delegation departed last evening." He gestures vaguely eastward. "After the meeting concluded, they wanted to begin the journey immediately while the roads are good. The seventeen crusaders went with them. Marco, Brother Guillem, Andrea, Alonso, Giovanni—all of them. They took provisions for the journey and your blessing."

He pauses, reading your face.

"They left messages if you wish to hear them. Marco asked me to tell you he will see Constantinople's walls or die trying. Brother Guillem said he goes to do God's work where it is most needed. Andrea..." The captain's weathered face softens. "Andrea said to tell you that the first crusader sworn will be the first to reach Constantinople."

The morning sun climbs higher. Basel's streets are beginning to wake—merchants opening shops, early mass bells ringing from the cathedral. Your party stands ready: thirty-three crusaders in white tabards, Fray Hernando with his simple traveling pack, horses stamping and snorting in the cool air.

The road south awaits. Emperor Sigismund, crowned two days ago in Rome, will be making his way north through the Italian Alps.

What do you do?

Great, I leave and ride towards the emperor. 

Draft a d100 table to see how that plays out. I try to meet him as soon as possible. Be realistic.

23 nov 2025

Weighed intercept success factors against medieval travel uncertainties realistically







I'll create a d100 table for intercepting Emperor Sigismund. Let me first assess the factors:

Success Factors:

Sigismund explicitly said he would "seek Juan out personally at Basel" in his letters
Sigismund travels with large imperial court - slow, highly visible
Limited Alpine routes from Rome to Germany - predictable path
Juan has small, mobile party that can move quickly
Can gather intelligence at towns about imperial procession's location
Sigismund genuinely wants this meeting
Failure Factors:

Medieval travel timing inherently uncertain
Sigismund might stop for extended visits with Italian lords/cities
Could take different passes (eastern vs. western routes)
Weather delays possible
Risk of taking parallel routes and missing each other
Juan's information could be outdated by days
D100 TABLE: INTERCEPTING EMPEROR SIGISMUND

1-10: Complete Miss You take the western passes while Sigismund goes east through Venetian territory. By the time you learn this, he's already past. You must return to Basel or wait there for him - losing 2-3 weeks. Meeting happens eventually but circumstances are poor.

11-25: Difficult Intercept Takes 7-10 days of hard riding and asking at every town. Finally catch him in northern Italy, but circumstances are rushed - he's pressed for time, you're both travel-weary. Brief roadside meeting, maybe one evening together. Functional but not ideal.

26-50: Standard Success 4-6 days of pursuing intelligence and riding south. Intercept him in the Italian Alps at a monastery or small city where he's resting. Good circumstances, a day or two together. Proper discussions possible. He's pleased you made the effort.

51-70: Good Intercept
3-4 days. Your information network works well - you learn his exact route and timing. Meet him at a comfortable alpine town. 2-3 days together with good accommodations. Excellent discussions. Sigismund impressed by your efficiency and dedication.

71-85: Excellent Meeting 2-3 days. Perfect intelligence and fast riding. Catch him at an ideal location - perhaps the monastery at Sankt Gotthard Pass or similar. 3-4 days together. Private chambers, good food, extended strategic discussions. Sigismund's advisors also present for detailed planning.

86-100: Exceptional Encounter Within 2 days, you intercept him at the perfect moment - arriving at a significant imperial stop (Pavia, Milan, or major monastery). He's delighted by your initiative and timing. Full week together with his court. Deep strategic partnership forms. Access to his Bohemian experts. He may even alter his schedule to spend more time with you.

Ready to roll when you are.

you have included how the meeting went in the results. Just include the travel and the meeting timing in the result. If a partnership develops will depend on other factors that we will discover seperately. Redraft the table.

23 nov 2025

Recalibrated table to isolate logistics from narrative outcomes


You're absolutely right. Let me redraft focusing only on the logistics:

D100 TABLE: INTERCEPTING EMPEROR SIGISMUND

1-10: Complete Miss You take different routes and miss each other entirely. By the time you learn where he actually went, he's already past your position. You must backtrack to Basel or wait there - losing 2-3 weeks. Will eventually meet at Basel, but the intercept fails.

11-25: Difficult Chase 7-10 days of hard riding south, asking at every town. Information is always a day or two old. Finally catch him in northern Italy, but you're travel-weary and he's pressed for time at a brief stop. Rushed circumstances - perhaps only a few hours at a coaching inn.

26-50: Standard Intercept 4-6 days of riding with decent intelligence. Meet him in the Italian Alps at a monastery or small town where he's stopped for rest. Standard accommodations. Have 1-2 days available before he continues north.

51-70: Good Timing 3-4 days. Your intelligence network works well - reliable information on his route. Intercept at a comfortable alpine town. Good accommodations. 2-3 days available together.

71-85: Efficient Intercept 2-3 days of fast riding with excellent information. Meet at a well-provisioned location (major monastery or prosperous town). Comfortable circumstances. 3-4 days available before either party needs to depart.

86-100: Perfect Intercept Within 2 days, you intercept him at an ideal location with excellent facilities. He's scheduled for an extended stop (major city like Milan, or important monastery). Full week potentially available, comfortable surroundings, good privacy for discussions.

Ready to roll when you are.

Orchestrated a favorable journey with realistic travel logistics



Roll: 56/100 - Good Timing

The road south from Basel winds through the Swiss cantons—green valleys giving way to steeper terrain as you approach the Alps. Your party moves swiftly: thirty-three crusaders, Fray Hernando, Captain Robles, and yourself. Small enough to make good time, large enough to be safe on the roads.

Day 1 (June 2nd): You ride to Lucerne, asking at coaching inns and church houses. A Benedictine prior confirms: "The Emperor passed through four days ago, heading toward Sankt Gotthard Pass. Large procession—imperial banners, sixty knights, wagons of documents."

Day 2 (June 3rd): Push hard toward the alpine passes. At Altdorf, a merchant provides better intelligence: "Emperor's at Bellinzona, south of the pass. Resting two days—his advisors are negotiating with Milan about safe passage through Lombard territory."

Day 3 (June 4th): Over Sankt Gotthard Pass. The altitude makes breathing hard for men and horses alike. You descend the southern slopes into Italy proper. At evening, a messenger riding north confirms: "Emperor left Bellinzona this morning, heading to Como. He stops there three days—meeting with the Archbishop and Milanese representatives."

Day 4 (June 5th): Early morning ride. Como appears in the distance—a prosperous city on the lake's edge, alpine mountains rising behind it. Imperial banners fly from the Archbishop's palace near the cathedral.

You arrive at mid-afternoon.

Como is bustling with the Emperor's presence. The Archbishop's palace guards recognize Castilian colors immediately—word of Granada's fall has spread even here. Within the hour, you're ushered into a comfortable receiving chamber.

The steward bows. "Your Majesty of Castile. His Imperial Majesty will receive you within the hour. He has been expecting you—when scouts reported Castilian banners approaching, he said, 'Good. The crusader king does not disappoint.'"

The steward gestures toward prepared chambers. "The Archbishop has made rooms available. His Imperial Majesty's schedule allows for two, perhaps three days here before he continues to Basel. He has canceled two audiences to make time for you."

Through the windows, you can see Como's cathedral and the lake beyond, its waters mirror-smooth in the afternoon sun. Fray Hernando stands quietly nearby, saying nothing but observing everything.

What do you do?

GM: We are about to enter into an important doscussion with the emperor. I want this to be realistic and a good simulation. Read NPC guide.md to learn what is important here. If a friendship develops with the emperor, that would be a huge gain, but I want it to be earned and realistic and historic. Keep this in mind moving forward. 

I tell everyone to wait outside, I want to meet the emperor alone. I wait for him to arrive.

23 nov 2025

Calibrated realistic emperor portrayal: shrewd, self-interested, testing visitor's competence








You dismiss your party. Captain Robles hesitates—his instinct is to stay close—but obeys. Fray Hernando simply nods and withdraws. The chamber falls quiet.

You wait alone.

The door opens without ceremony. No herald, no announcement. The man who enters is in his mid-sixties, tall but stooped slightly, with a lined face that speaks of decades spent managing impossible problems. His clothing is fine but travel-worn—he's been on the road for weeks. The imperial regalia is absent; this is not a formal audience.

Emperor Sigismund of Luxembourg, King of Hungary, King of Bohemia, King of Germany, Holy Roman Emperor—crowned just five days ago in Rome—closes the door behind him and studies you with sharp, intelligent eyes that have seen thirty-five years of war with the Hussites, two decades of church schism, and more failed negotiations than most men witness in a lifetime.

He speaks in Latin, his voice gravelly with age. "Juan of Castile. The crusader king who actually finished his crusade." There's no mockery in the tone, but no warmth either. Assessing. "I received your letter from Basel. You rode hard to intercept me—your horses will need rest."

He moves to a chair without invitation, gestures for you to sit as well. The informality is deliberate—not an audience, but a conversation between men who both understand power.

"I have been crowned Emperor of an empire that barely listens to me. I rule Bohemia, which has spent thirty-five years telling me to go to hell. I lead Christendom's secular arm while Pope and Council tear each other apart over who actually leads the Church."

He leans back, studying you.

"And now a Spanish king—from a kingdom I have never visited, whose affairs have never touched mine—rides three days through the Alps to meet me on the road. You have my attention, Juan of Castile. But I have been disappointed by ambitious young kings before. So tell me: what do you actually want?"

The question is blunt. Not hostile, but not friendly. The tone of a man who has heard too many grand promises and seen too few kept.

I shake his hand and sit down. 

"I do not want anything from you sir. There are things I do want, but are outside my power to get. A unified and stable church for example. Christian realms defended against muslim raids and pirates and slavers. I describe this to others as the kingdom of God. Maybe it is? I was wondering if - since you visited the pope not long after I did - you might share some of these wants yourself? If you are, we can ask ourselves not what one can do for the other, but rather how we can achieve that what we cannot achieve on our own."

Draft a d100 table to see how the emperor reacts. Use the guides from NPC guide.md

23 nov 2025

Calibrated NPC reaction ranges across honesty, skepticism, and strategic engagement












D100 TABLE: SIGISMUND'S INITIAL REACTION

Let me analyze Juan's approach using the NPC Guide:

Success Factors:

Juan actually completed his crusade (proves he delivers, not just talks)
Honest admission of limitations ("outside my power")
Lists real shared concerns Sigismund faces (church crisis, Muslim threats)
Collaborative framing, not asking for help
Opening with "I don't want anything" is disarming
Failure Factors:

"Kingdom of God" language could sound messianic/naive to cynical old warrior
Vague on specifics - what does "cooperation" actually mean?
Sigismund has heard grand visions from ambitious young kings before
35 years of Bohemian nightmare has made him deeply skeptical
What makes Juan different from other disappointed hopes?
Approach Quality: COMPETENT - Honest and humble, but still somewhat abstract. Hasn't yet demonstrated understanding of Sigismund's specific nightmares.

1-25: Polite Skepticism Sigismund hears idealism from another young king who hasn't been ground down by reality. "Kingdom of God" sounds naive. He responds politely but without engagement - generic agreement that problems exist, but no opening for real conversation. Testing whether Juan has substance or just grand words. Cool, professional, guarded.

26-45: Cautious Testing Appreciates honesty but remains skeptical. Sigismund asks pointed questions: "What does cooperation actually mean? What can you deliver beyond words? I've heard 'unified Christendom' from a dozen kings—why should I believe you're different?" Probing to see if Juan understands real complexity or just has visions. Not dismissive, but demanding proof of seriousness.

46-65: Genuine Interest, Still Guarded Sigismund recognizes Juan DID complete Granada—that matters. Actions speak. Engages more seriously, but wants to understand if Juan thinks strategically or just idealistically. Shares some of his own frustrations carefully. Real conversation begins, but he's still testing whether Juan grasps how hard these problems actually are. Waiting to see depth.

66-80: Real Engagement The combination of accomplishment and humility resonates. Sigismund opens up about his struggles—Bohemia, the church crisis, being ignored despite imperial title. Sees someone who acts rather than just talks. Willing to discuss specific possibilities. Still some wariness, but genuine interest in partnership. Wants to know Juan better before committing.

81-95: Strong Connection Deeply impressed. Finally, a king who delivers AND admits limitations. Sigismund shares his burdens frankly—the weight of decades of failure, the exhaustion of trying to hold things together. Sees potential real ally. Opens meaningful strategic discussion. Still experienced enough not to make immediate commitments, but clearly moved.

96-100: Profound Recognition Something in Juan's combination—the completed crusade, the three-day ride, the humble words—strikes Sigismund deeply. He's old, tired, and has almost given up on finding kings with integrity. This feels different. Opens completely about his failures and hopes. Real possibility of deep partnership. Rare moment of connection between rulers who understand what power actually costs.

Ready to roll when you are.

23 nov 2025

Calibrated skeptical response to test genuine strategic understanding




Roll: 34/100 - Cautious Testing

Sigismund's expression doesn't change, but something shifts in his posture. He leans forward slightly, hands folded.

"The Kingdom of God." His tone is flat. "I have been hearing about the Kingdom of God from ambitious kings for forty years. Usually right before they ask me to commit troops to their wars or recognize their territorial claims or help them against their enemies."

He stands, walks to the window overlooking Como's cathedral and the lake beyond. His back to you.

"You say you want a unified church. So does Pope Eugenius—with himself as absolute authority. So does the Council of Basel—with popes reduced to administrators. Both sides invoke God's will. Both claim they serve unity. Both are tearing Christendom apart."

He turns back, eyes hard.

"You say you want Christian realms defended against Muslim raids. Granada was real—I'll grant you that. You did what you said you would do. That matters." A pause. "But Granada was your enemy at your border threatening your kingdom. Easy to be a crusader when the infidel is burning your villages."

Sigismund returns to his chair, sits heavily.

"The Ottomans sit at Hungary's borders. Have for decades. Where were the Christian kings when we begged for crusades? They sent letters of support and small contingents that went home after one season. We've been bleeding alone for thirty years."

His gaze is direct, unflinching.

"So tell me, Juan of Castile: What does 'cooperation' actually mean? What can you deliver beyond words and visions? I've heard 'unified Christendom' from a dozen kings. Why should I believe you're different from them?"

The chamber is silent. Outside, you can hear bells ringing for vespers.

"Convince me you understand what you're actually proposing. Because 'Kingdom of God' is what priests say. Kings who've actually ruled know the world is made of interests, resources, and power. Which world do you live in?"

I do what I can sir. I do what I can. 

I have committed 1000 soldiers to the defence of Constantinople as well as 60.000 florins to repair their walls. This is a gift to help them and I am visiting themn after my wife has given birth to see how I can support them sustainably long-term. I am pressing my cousin's claims for the crown of Naples and with the kingdoms of Castille, Aragon and Naples united in a strong alliance, I have the capabilities to also have the fleet to aid the Greeks. 

In regards to church reform, I see mainly two things. I see genuine need for reform. But on the other hand, I also see greed, fear, factionalism. All sins. The French support reforms, but do they really on the merit of these reforms, or do they see this as a vehicle to gain more power for their own powerbase at the expanse of Rome? Only when we can see our own direct needs can we see what gains us all the most. What the kingdom of God actually looks like. Or that is what I choose to believe anyway. We will always fail. I will fail. But God sees our struggles. 

But enouth about me. What do you think about the hussites? If I were a younger man living in your Germany, I would have probably have joined one of your crusades against the hussites because I used to think that God's will and the church were one and the same. Now I think that the church may be good and true, but some church members may be sinful or even corrupt. That is what visiting Basel does to you. 

What do you think about the situation? What are the things you want but are outside of your control?

Analyzed Juan's rhetorical progress and mapped Sigismund's psychological vulnerabilities









Sigismund's expression shifts. Something in your words—perhaps the admission of failure, perhaps the mention of Basel's effect on your faith, perhaps the simple question about his burdens—cracks the professional wariness.

He's quiet for a long moment.

"Constantinople." He nods slowly. "A thousand men and sixty thousand florins. That's real. Not a letter promising prayers or twenty knights who'll leave after winter." He looks at you directly. "Emperor John wrote me five years ago begging for aid. I sent three hundred Hungarians. They're still there—the ones who survived. Three hundred men to hold back the Sultan's armies while the rest of Christendom debates the Filioque."

He stands again, but this time there's less restlessness in the movement. More weight.

"You ask about the Hussites." A bitter laugh. "Thirty-five years. Five crusades. All failures. Do you know why we lost, Juan? Not because they're better warriors—though their war wagons are damn effective. We lost because..."

He turns to face you.

"Because they're right about half of what they say. The Church is corrupt. Priests do hold five benefices and visit none. Bishops do live like princes while peasants starve. Rome does drain Bohemia's wealth for Italian wars. When Jan Hus said these things, he spoke truth."

Sigismund's voice hardens.

"Then he denied transubstantiation. Then he claimed scripture alone suffices. Then his followers started taking communion in both kinds—claiming the same authority as priests. Then they seized Church lands worth millions. Then they butchered monks and burned monasteries."

He sits heavily.

"So tell me, Juan—where does legitimate reform end and heresy begin? How do you separate the wheat from the chaff? The French at Basel use 'reform' as a weapon against Rome. The Hussites use 'reform' to justify rebellion. Where is the actual Kingdom of God in all this?"

His eyes meet yours—and for the first time, you see genuine exhaustion behind the imperial dignity.

"You say you would have joined my crusades as a younger man. Now you're less certain. Good. That makes you wiser than the popes who keep demanding I destroy the Hussites utterly while Rome's corruption is what created them in the first place."

He leans forward.

"What do I want that's outside my control? I want to end the Bohemian war without destroying Bohemia. I want the Church reformed without the Church destroyed. I want to stop the Ottomans without bleeding Hungary to death. I want..."

A pause.

"I want one Christian king who understands that these problems don't have simple solutions. That sometimes the heretics have legitimate grievances. That sometimes reform requires admitting the Church failed. That power isn't about grand visions—it's about carrying impossible burdens for decades until you die."

The silence stretches.

"You rode three days to meet me. You admitted you will fail. You asked about my burdens instead of telling me about your glorious plans." His voice softens slightly. "That's... unusual. So I'll ask you plainly: Why are you here, Juan? What do you actually hope will come from this conversation?"

Before I answer that, may I ask how your talk and relationship with the pope has been? Do you support a specific action in the church? What is your relationship with the church and the pope?

24 nov 2025

Weighed Sigismund's conflicted loyalties between pope and council






Sigismund considers the question, then gives a short, harsh laugh.

"My relationship with the Pope." He shakes his head. "Five days ago, Eugenius placed the imperial crown on my head in Rome. Beautiful ceremony. Solemn oaths. He called me the secular sword of Christendom, defender of the faith."

He stands, paces.

"Before that? He kept me waiting two years for the coronation. Two years of negotiations, conditions, demands. He wanted guarantees I'd support him against Basel. Wanted me to force the Council to submit. I kept saying: 'Holy Father, I need both of you to help me end the Bohemian war.' He kept saying: 'First, bring the Council to heel.'"

Sigismund turns to face you.

"Eugenius is not Martin V. Martin understood politics—you could negotiate with him, find compromises. Eugenius..." A pause. "Eugenius believes absolutely in papal supremacy. The Council exists to advise, not to govern. Any talk of Haec Sancta being permanent law enrages him. He sees Basel as rebellion that must be crushed."

He returns to his seat.

"And Basel? The Council fathers invoke Haec Sancta like it's scripture. 'Councils are superior to popes, directly from Christ.' The French want to reduce the papacy to nothing—make the Pope a figurehead who obeys conciliar decrees. Cardinal Aleman's faction would depose Eugenius tomorrow if they had the votes."

His expression darkens.

"Both sides tell me I must choose. The Pope says: 'You're Emperor—command the Council to submit.' Basel says: 'You're Emperor—make the Pope attend and obey our decrees.' And I tell them both: 'I'm Emperor of an empire that barely listens to me. I have no power to command either of you.'"

Sigismund leans back.

"What do I support? I support ending this madness before we have two popes again. I support reforms that address real corruption—pluralism, absenteeism, simony. The Session Twelve decree Basel passed is good law. It should be implemented."

He meets your eyes.

"But I also believe the Church needs a strong pope. Not a tyrant, but not a figurehead either. Spiritual authority requires spiritual leadership. Committees don't provide that."

A pause.

"So I've been trying to mediate. Get Eugenius to accept some conciliar authority. Get Basel to acknowledge papal primacy. Find middle ground. But neither side wants middle ground—they want total victory."

His voice grows quieter.

"And meanwhile, the Hussites watch. The moderate Utraquists came to Basel because they genuinely want reconciliation. But they'll only negotiate if they believe the Church is actually reforming—that their grievances are heard. If Pope and Council are at war, the Hussites see it as proof the Church is irredeemably corrupt."

Sigismund looks at you directly.

"So no, Juan, I don't have a simple position. I need both Pope and Council to survive. I need reforms to happen. I need the Bohemian war to end. And I have no power to make any of it happen."

He spreads his hands.

"Now. You asked about my relationship with the Church. I've told you. Your turn: Why are you asking?"

I wish for the same outcome as you. I want a strong church that is reformed. This factionalism serves no-one. 

Appealing to man's better nature is always good, but I have learned that real power often speaks much more strongly than just words. 

When I spoke with the pope he understood that reform was needed, but he did not want to bow down to the power of the council. He is more concerned about his position than he is with reforming the church. 

I have found a way for him to support the reform without losing authority over the council. I have with me a copy of the reforms passed by the council the pope can pass the exact same decree on his own initiative. He is not acknowledging the authority of the council, but the decree on reforms has been passed anyway.

I would also like to make clear that the church will have to find a way stay united. And that there are limits to the pope's military might and support. I lend my sword to christendom but I refure to fight for more wealth for bishops. I actually think that recognizing haec sancta would to wonders to unite the church, even though that might not be realistic right now. 

There should be a pope, but the church is simply too large now to be ruled by any single person. It would be a strong signal if you support this position as well. If both you, who are emperor of all lands north of rome and I who through my alliance control the lands to the south, speak with one voice in these matters, we might achieve what we individually might not. 

I was hoping that if we can adopt a position together, we might put more pressure on the church to be united. Since we want the same outcome. Push through reforms using this system. Declare a crusade against the Ottomans. When the church is reformed in this way, much support for the hussites hopefully falls away as well. If there are still nobles who have used the rebellion for their own personal gain, we can demand their lands back, hopefully without conflict. 

That is what I hope for.

Evaluated Juan's diplomatic strategy against Sigismund's pragmatic expectations











D100 TABLE: SIGISMUND'S REACTION TO PARTNERSHIP PROPOSAL

Let me analyze Juan's approach using the NPC Guide:

Success Factors:

Concrete mechanism (parallel legislation), not vague promises
Joint leverage strategy (north + south of Rome unified)
Acknowledges Haec Sancta legitimacy (significant concession)
Understands Pope's real concern (authority, not reform substance)
Recognizes Church too large for single-person rule (sophisticated)
Combined crusade against Ottomans (addresses Sigismund's nightmare)
Juan has proven track record (Granada delivered)
Failure Factors:

"Hopefully without conflict" for Church lands is PROFOUNDLY NAIVE - these lands worth millions, nobles fought 5 crusades to keep them
Assumes Hussite support "falls away" with reform - ignores 35 years of sunk costs, blood, martyrs
Oversimplifies: reform → crusade → Hussite collapse → peaceful land return
Juan's leverage partly theoretical (Naples alliance not secured)
What if Pope refuses parallel legislation? What if Council rejects it? No enforcement mechanism discussed
Timeline is optimistic
Shows Juan doesn't fully grasp Bohemian complexity
Approach Quality: GOOD BUT REVEALS NAIVETY - Strong on church politics, weak on Bohemian reality. The "hopefully without conflict" line will be a red flag to Sigismund that Juan doesn't understand what he's actually proposing for Bohemia.

1-20: Disappointment Sets In Juan sounded wise initially but revealed fundamental misunderstanding of Bohemia. "Hopefully without conflict" shows he has no idea what he's talking about—those lands are worth everything, held by nobles who've bled for them for decades. Sigismund expected better. He responds politely but distantly, another young king with grand plans that ignore reality. Minimal engagement, no commitment.

21-40: Qualified Interest, Deep Skepticism Appreciates parallel legislation idea and combined leverage concept, but deeply troubled by Bohemian naivety. Points out problems bluntly: "You think nobles will surrender fortunes 'hopefully without conflict'? You think reform makes 35 years of Hussite sacrifice disappear?" Willing to discuss church strategy, but won't commit to partnership if Juan doesn't understand what he's proposing. Testing whether Juan can learn.

41-60: Serious Engagement, Reality Check Needed Impressed by church politics understanding, concerned about Bohemian blindness. Will work through plan systematically—praising what's sound, dissecting what's naive. Sees potential partnership but Juan needs education on Bohemian complexity first. "The church plan is good. The Bohemian plan will get people killed and solve nothing." Conditional interest if Juan proves teachable.

61-75: Strong Partnership, Educational Partnership Juan's overall strategic thinking sound even if some assumptions naive. Sigismund commits to joint church pressure while firmly correcting Bohemian misconceptions. Real alliance forming—but Juan must understand: Church lands won't return peacefully, Hussite problem won't vanish with reform. Partnership based on Juan learning hard truths. Opens up about Bohemian complexity.

76-90: Deep Alliance Despite Naivety Juan's combination of delivery (Granada) and strategic sophistication (parallel legislation, combined leverage) outweighs naive Bohemian assumptions. Sigismund commits strongly to partnership, will share detailed intelligence, work as true allies. Still corrects naive parts but sees someone capable of learning. Finally found a king who thinks strategically AND acts. Worth investing in despite gaps in understanding.

91-100: Profound Partnership Sigismund overlooks naive assumptions because overall approach is extraordinarily sound. Juan understands church politics better than most cardinals, offers real power partnership, and proved he delivers. Commits fully—opens completely about strategies, failures, fears. Sees Juan as the partner he's searched for decades. Will personally mentor Juan on Bohemian complexity. Real brotherhood of rulers who understand burden of power.

Ready to roll when you are.

Calibrated skeptical engagement while testing interlocutor's comprehension



Roll: 22/100 - Qualified Interest, Deep Skepticism

Sigismund listens without interruption. When you finish, he's silent for a long moment. His expression is complicated—interest warring with something darker.

"The parallel legislation." He nods slowly. "That's clever. Eugenius passes the reform on his own authority, same text as Basel. Neither side subordinates. Both can claim victory." A pause. "Combined pressure from north and south—yes, that could work. The church strategy is sound."

He stands, walks to the window again. His shoulders are tense.

"But then you said something that tells me you don't understand what you're proposing." He turns back, and his voice is harder. "You think that after reform, 'support for the Hussites hopefully falls away' and we can 'demand their lands back, hopefully without conflict.'"

Sigismund crosses the room in three strides, stops directly in front of you.

"Juan. Listen carefully. Those Church lands are worth millions of florins. Not thousands—millions. Every major Bohemian noble family holds estates they seized from monasteries. They've held them for twenty years. They've built their power on them. They've married their children using the wealth from them."

His voice rises slightly.

"You think they'll just... give them back? 'Hopefully without conflict'? These are men who've fought five crusades to keep those lands. Men who've buried sons defending them. Men whose entire position depends on never surrendering them."

He returns to his chair, sits heavily.

"And the Hussites themselves—you think reform makes thirty-five years of blood disappear? They've lost fathers, brothers, sons fighting for this cause. Jan Hus burned at the stake. Thousands died at Kutná Hora, at Ústí, at Tachov. Martyrs whose names every Hussite child knows."

Sigismund leans forward.

"Reform doesn't erase that. Reform doesn't bring back the dead. The moderate Utraquists might—might—negotiate if Rome grants communion in both kinds and stops the persecution. But getting the Church lands back?" He shakes his head. "That requires either overwhelming military force or accepting they're lost forever. There is no 'hopefully without conflict.'"

The silence stretches. Outside, the lake is turning dark as evening falls.

"So here's my question, Juan of Castile." His voice is quieter now, but intense. "You understand church politics better than half the cardinals I know. You've built a real strategic framework. You actually completed a crusade when others just talk."

He pauses.

"Can you learn? Can you hear me when I tell you Bohemia is more complicated than 'reform then peace'? Or are you like every other ambitious king—brilliant about your own plans, deaf to realities that don't fit your vision?"

His eyes are direct, uncompromising.

"Because I'll work with you on the church strategy. That's good thinking. But I won't commit to full partnership with someone who thinks we can solve the Bohemian nightmare with reforms and hope. That's how thousands more die for nothing."

"Show me you can hear hard truths. Tell me: what do you actually understand about the Bohemian situation? Not what you hope—what you know?"

Let me recognize immediately that my understanding of the Bohemian situation is second-hand at best. From what I have been told, I know that the hussites fight with conviction because of lack of reform. If we grant them communion in both kinds and some other reforms as well, this will hopefully diminish their zeal. The rebellion has been so successful because the rebels have something to fight for and the papal states and their crusades are viewed as tyrannical, opressive and unjust. Take that away from them and what do they have left? 

I hope that from that situation, we can find a way to adress the greed by Bohemian nobles who have used the rebellion to enrich themselves. I cannot see exactly what that would look like, maybe that is looking too far into the future. But it underlines the importance for the church to reform. First take the moral high ground, then look what exactly to do next, but I am operating under the assumption that our position will have improved greatly if we do.

Assessed character's intellectual humility and readiness for deeper strategic dialogue







Sigismund's posture shifts. The hard edge in his expression softens—not to warmth, not yet, but to something like grudging respect.

"Second-hand at best." He repeats the words slowly. "Do you know how rare that is? To hear a king admit he doesn't know something?"

He leans back, studying you differently now.

"Alright. You can hear. So let me teach you what thirty-five years has taught me about Bohemia."

He holds up one finger.

"First: there is no single 'Hussite' movement. There are factions. The Utraquists—the moderates—they want communion in both kinds, vernacular preaching, reform of clerical abuses. Many are sincere Catholics who believe Rome has strayed. These men might negotiate. They came to Basel because they want reconciliation."

A second finger.

"Then there are the Taborites. The radicals. They've gone far beyond reform—they reject the Real Presence, reject the priesthood itself, reject almost everything Rome teaches. They've built their own society, their own theology, their own identity. Reform won't bring them back. Nothing will bring them back. They've become something new."

A third finger.

"And the Orphans—followers of Jan Žižka after his death. Warriors who've known nothing but war for twenty years. Fighting is what they are now. Peace threatens their very identity."

He drops his hand.

"You're right that reform weakens the moral position of the radicals. If Rome grants communion in both kinds, the Utraquists lose their main grievance. Some will reconcile. But the Taborites and Orphans? They'll call the Utraquists traitors. They'll keep fighting. And the Utraquist nobles who hold Church lands?"

Sigismund shakes his head.

"They'll take the religious reconciliation and keep the lands. They'll say: 'We've made peace with Rome, the war is over, these lands are ours by right of twenty years' possession.' And legally? They might be right. There's a principle—praescriptio—that long possession creates legitimate title."

He stands, moves to a side table where wine has been set out. Pours two cups, hands one to you without asking.

"So here's the truth, Juan. The best outcome—the best—is this: Utraquists reconcile with Rome. They keep most of the lands because we can't take them back without another war we'd probably lose. Taborites and Orphans remain hostile but isolated, slowly weakening over decades without Utraquist support. The Church accepts it lost millions in Bohemia forever but gains peace."

He drinks.

"That's not victory. That's managed failure. That's what thirty-five years of war has reduced my hopes to."

Sigismund sits again, wine cup in hand, eyes on you.

"Now you understand better. The moral high ground matters—you're right about that. Reform first, then negotiate from strength. But 'strength' in Bohemia means accepting losses that would make your Spanish bishops weep. Can you support that? Can you tell the Pope that saving the Church in Bohemia means accepting that the Church lost Bohemia's wealth forever?"

I can accept much if it means reforming and therefore uniting the church. 

I think we should focus on reform for now. The matter of papal versus council superiority is something that can be solved later if we can sidestep the matter by dual legislations system. 

Can we come up with a common declaration stating we want the church to reform? If we state that we are determined that this is the way forward, it will hopefully unite both our church factions and gain a majority in the council. And it will signal to the pope that there are limits to his power and he has to accept concessions in order for the church to stabilize. Then, after the reforms have passed, we re-assess. 

What do you think?

Weighed proposal's strategic merit against practical obstacles and psychological factors







D100 TABLE: SIGISMUND'S RESPONSE TO JOINT DECLARATION PROPOSAL

Success Factors:

Juan demonstrated he can learn and listen (huge in Sigismund's eyes)
Concrete, actionable proposal - not vague hopes
"Re-assess after reforms" shows strategic patience
Aligns with Sigismund's stated goals (reform without destroying Church)
Combined leverage is real - Emperor + Castile-Aragon-Naples bloc
Dual legislation sidesteps authority question elegantly
Sigismund has been seeking exactly this kind of partnership
Failure Factors:

Sigismund's actual leverage is limited - he said himself "I have no power to command"
French faction at Basel has own agenda, won't follow two kings' lead
Pope might see joint declaration as threat, harden position rather than yield
What's the enforcement mechanism if either side refuses?
Sigismund has tried mediating for years - why would this succeed?
Joint declaration commits Sigismund publicly - risk of exposure if it fails
Council factions deeply entrenched, declaration may change nothing
Approach Quality: GOOD - Focused, concrete, patient. Juan showed he learned from Bohemian lecture by not overpromising.

1-20: Too Cautious to Commit Decades of failed initiatives have made Sigismund gun-shy. Appreciates the thinking but won't put his name to something that might fail publicly. Offers vague support without formal commitment. "I'll consider it" means "probably not."

21-40: Interested But Demanding Specifics Likes the direction but needs concrete answers before committing. What exactly does declaration say? How do we present it without appearing to threaten the Pope? What if French faction rejects it? Won't sign anything until these questions answered. Partnership possible but requires more work.

41-60: Conditional Agreement Willing to pursue joint declaration if they can agree on precise wording and approach. Wants to shape the text himself—not just sign Juan's draft. Insists on careful framing that pressures both Pope AND radical conciliarists. Real negotiation begins over specifics.

61-75: Genuine Partnership Forming Sigismund sees this as the breakthrough he's sought. Commits to working on joint declaration together. Shares his own ideas about framing and timing. Discusses who at Basel and Rome might support this. Treats Juan as genuine strategic partner. Still cautious about details but fundamentally committed.

76-90: Strong Alliance Juan's combination of learning, concrete thinking, and proven delivery convinces Sigismund this could actually work. Commits fully to joint declaration. Opens up about his own contacts and strategies. Begins detailed planning—timing, messengers, who to approach first. Real trust developing.

91-100: Complete Strategic Partnership Sigismund has waited decades for a partner like this. Commits enthusiastically, shares everything—his failures, his remaining leverage, his secret communications with moderate factions. They work as true equals planning the declaration together. Beginning of profound alliance.

Calibrated cautious negotiation stance for experienced diplomat



Roll: 41/100 - Conditional Agreement

Sigismund sets down his wine cup and regards you steadily. The wariness hasn't disappeared, but something has shifted—he's no longer testing whether you're worth his time. Now he's calculating whether this could actually work.

"A joint declaration." He turns the words over. "Two of Christendom's most powerful secular rulers speaking with one voice on reform. Emperor and the king who just completed the Reconquista." A pause. "That carries weight. Real weight."

He stands, moves to a writing desk in the corner of the chamber. Shuffles through papers—letters, drafts, notes accumulated over weeks of travel.

"But I won't sign my name to something vague. 'We want reform' means nothing. Every faction at Basel claims to want reform. The Pope claims to want reform. Words without specifics are just... noise."

He turns back to you.

"If we do this, the declaration must thread a very narrow path. It must pressure Eugenius to accept reforms—but not so aggressively that he sees us as enemies aligned with Basel against him. It must support the Council's reform work—but not endorse their claim to supremacy over the Pope."

Sigismund returns to his seat, leaning forward intently.

"And there's another problem. The French. Cardinal Louis Aleman and his faction don't want reform—they want to destroy papal authority entirely. If our declaration looks like support for their position, we strengthen the radicals. If it looks like support for the Pope, we lose the moderate reformers."

He holds up a hand, ticking off points on his fingers.

"So. Before I commit to anything, I need answers. First: what specific reforms do we name? Pluralism, yes—that's easy. Simony, clerical taxation, episcopal elections. But do we mention Haec Sancta? Do we acknowledge conciliar authority at all? That's where it gets dangerous."

A second finger.

"Second: how do we present this? A public declaration at Basel? A private letter to the Pope first, giving him chance to act before we go public? The sequencing matters enormously. Get it wrong and Eugenius sees conspiracy against him."

A third finger.

"Third: what do we actually threaten? Declarations without consequences are ignored. You mentioned limits to papal military support. Are you willing to say that publicly? That Castile won't fight wars for unreformed bishops? Because that would get attention—but it would also make enemies."

He drops his hand, eyes fixed on yours.

"I've tried to mediate this crisis for two years, Juan. I've failed because I had no leverage—just an imperial title that no one respects. You offer real leverage. But leverage misused is worse than no leverage at all."

Sigismund gestures between you.

"So. Let's draft something together. Here, now, while we have two or three days. Not a final text—but a framework we both agree on. If we can find words that satisfy us both, I'll sign. If we can't..."

He shrugs.

"Then we part as friendly kings who couldn't quite align. No shame in that. But I won't put my name to something half-formed that might make things worse."

He pulls a chair closer to the writing desk, gestures for you to join him.

"Come. Let's see if we can actually agree on what 'reform' means when you have to write it down."

The evening light is fading. Servants appear at the door—Sigismund waves them away without looking. This conversation, it seems, is not finished.

What do you do?

Firstly, we stay away from the haec sancta. We sidestep this matter for now. In regards for what ectual reforms to support, I have drafted a document for that already. 

I signal for Fray Hernando to join us and to show us the Castillian reforms as proposed by my delegation. 

As for our communication, I propose we send a letter to the pope together. And also a letter to aligned delegates at Basel as well. This should make our position clear and have a positive impact. 

Thirdly, this must be handled carefully. Maybe suggest to the pope that as faithful rulers, the church must reform as we cannot fight rebellions against the church everywhere. The hussite heresy has proved this. 

Question; pope Martin was quite political. The result of the scism compromise. How iss it possible that what seems to be another papalist hardlines has been elected again after him?

Synthesized papal succession dynamics and orchestrated diplomatic strategy









Sigismund nods at your signal, and a servant is dispatched. Within minutes, Fray Hernando enters—his expression carefully neutral, though his eyes take in the scene quickly: two rulers at a writing desk, wine cups, the informal intimacy of genuine negotiation.

"Your Majesty. Your Imperial Majesty." He bows to each in turn.

"The Castilian reform proposals, Fray Hernando," you say. "The documents our delegation has been working from at Basel."

Fray Hernando produces a leather folio from his robes—he's been carrying it, you realize, anticipating this moment. He sets it on the desk and steps back, waiting.

Sigismund glances at the documents but doesn't reach for them yet. Your question about Eugenius has caught his attention.

"How did a papalist hardliner follow Martin?" He laughs bitterly. "Because the cardinals are fools who thought they could control him."

He stands, pacing as he explains.

"Martin died in February of thirty-one. The conclave met. The cardinals were tired of Colonna nepotism—Martin had enriched his family shamelessly. They wanted someone pious, someone manageable. Gabriel Condulmer—Eugenius—seemed perfect. A Venetian monk. Austere. No powerful family backing him. They made him sign a capitulation before the election: promises to share power with the college, continue the council, limit papal authority."

Sigismund's expression sours.

"Then he was elected. And within months, he tried to dissolve Basel entirely. Declared the Council illegitimate. Ordered everyone home."

He shakes his head.

"It was a disaster. The Council refused. Invoked Haec Sancta. Threatened to depose him like Constance deposed the schism popes. Eugenius had to back down—publicly humiliated. He's been fighting to recover ever since."

Sigismund returns to the desk.

"So now you understand him. He's not a hardliner by nature—he's a hardliner because he tried to crush Basel and failed. Every concession now feels like another defeat. Every reform looks like the Council claiming victory over him. He's backed into a corner of his own making."

He taps the table.

"That's why your approach might actually work. You're not asking him to submit to Basel. You're offering him a way to lead the reform—to claim credit for it. Parallel legislation lets him save face." A pause. "But he'll need persuading that this isn't another trap. He's been burned before."

Sigismund finally reaches for the Castilian documents, spreading them on the desk.

"Now. Let's see what your delegation has proposed. And then we draft these letters—one to Eugenius, one to our allies at Basel."

He looks up at you.

"Fray Hernando stays? He knows the Council's mood better than either of us."

Yes, Fray, walk us through what our delegation has proposed.

24 nov 2025

Synthesized historical reform proposals for Castilian delegation presentation






Fray Hernando moves to the desk, his worn hands spreading the documents with the care of a man who has spent months working on them.

"Your Majesty. Your Imperial Majesty." He glances between you. "Our delegation arrived at Basel with instructions to support meaningful reform while preserving Church unity. We have worked within the deputation system, building coalitions where possible."

He separates the documents into groups.

"The reforms fall into several categories. Some have already passed. Others are still being debated."

First group:

"Pluralism and absenteeism. Session Twelve addressed this directly—the decree limiting how many benefices one cleric may hold." He taps the document. "Under the old practice, a single bishop might hold three or four dioceses, visiting none, collecting income from all. The decree restricts this sharply. One man, one major benefice. Exceptions require papal dispensation with genuine cause."

Sigismund nods. "I've read it. Good law. The question is enforcement."

"Precisely, Your Imperial Majesty. Which leads to the second reform."

Second group:

"Episcopal elections. This has been... contentious." Fray Hernando chooses his words carefully. "The decree restores electoral rights to cathedral chapters. Bishops chosen by their clergy, not appointed by Rome in exchange for payment."

He glances at Sigismund. "This threatens papal revenue directly. Every appointment sold is income lost. But it also addresses one of the Hussites' core grievances—bishops imposed from outside who care nothing for their flocks."

Third group:

"Annates and taxation. The fees paid to Rome upon receiving a benefice." Fray Hernando's expression tightens. "This is where the French have been most aggressive. They want annates abolished entirely. Our position has been more moderate—reduce them, standardize them, but not eliminate papal revenue completely. A weakened papacy serves no one."

Fourth group:

"Simony—the sale of Church offices and sacraments." He shakes his head. "Everyone agrees it is sinful. No one agrees on enforcement. We have supported clear penalties: removal from office, excommunication. But who enforces? The Pope? The bishops who bought their positions? The Council that has no army?"

Fray Hernando steps back slightly.

"There is also the matter of monastic reform, clerical education, and regulation of indulgences. These are longer-term projects. The Council has committees studying them, but nothing has reached the floor for vote."

He looks at you directly.

"Your Majesty, the Castilian position has been this: support every reform that addresses genuine corruption, resist any reform designed primarily to weaken the papacy for political gain. It is... a difficult line to walk. The French see us as papal sympathizers. The papal loyalists see us as conciliarists. Cardinal Cesarini sees us as the only sane voices in the room."

A thin smile.

"I leave it to Your Majesty to judge which assessment is correct."

Sigismund has been scanning the documents as Fray Hernando spoke. He looks up now, tapping the electoral reform decree.

"This. This is the key. If Eugenius accepts this text—passes it himself as papal legislation—it changes everything. The Council's main achievement becomes his achievement. The French lose their weapon."

He looks at you.

"Can you persuade him? You met with him in Rome. Does he trust you enough to accept this from your hand rather than seeing it as Basel's victory imposed on him?"

Let us write him a letter together, and also state that I will visit him soon after my wife has delivered. That way, he can prepare for our meeting, knowing that we both support this reform. 

Do you support the reforms as they are adressed in this document? And are you ready to sign on it with me together?

Weighed Sigismund's competing motivations against proposal presentation strategy







D100 TABLE: SIGISMUND'S RESPONSE TO SIGNING JOINT LETTER

Success Factors:

Juan demonstrated ability to learn (Bohemian conversation impressed him)
Concrete documents with specific reforms, not vague promises
Castilian position is moderate—exactly the balance Sigismund wants
Sigismund already called electoral reform "the key"
Follow-up papal visit shows commitment to execution
Fray Hernando's presence confirms Council insider support
Sigismund has been seeking exactly this partnership
Failure Factors:

Sigismund said he wanted to "draft something together"—this is signing Castilian proposals
Has he reviewed documents thoroughly enough to commit his name?
Some provisions might conflict with German or Bohemian interests he hasn't mentioned
Electoral reform also threatens secular rulers who influence appointments
Public commitment exposes him if initiative fails
His instinct is caution after years of failed attempts
Annates position—is it too moderate or too aggressive for his situation?
Approach Quality: GOOD - Concrete, actionable, shows commitment. But slightly presumptuous—asking him to sign Castilian work rather than co-drafting.

1-20: Needs More Time Sigismund respects the work but won't sign today. Wants his own advisors to review, needs to consider German implications. Not rejection—genuine caution. Proposes exchanging drafts, finalizing by letter over coming weeks. Partnership delayed, not dead.

21-40: Wants Modifications First Agrees in principle but insists on changes to specific provisions. Perhaps annates position too soft, or electoral reform needs carve-outs for imperial interests. Real negotiation over text required before he signs. Willing to work through the night if necessary, but won't rubber-stamp.

41-60: Signs With Conditions Will sign joint letter but wants specific framing or additions. Perhaps stronger language on enforcement, or explicit mention of Hussite reconciliation as goal. Minor modifications, not fundamental objections. Conditional yes—partnership forming but on shared terms.

61-75: Signs With Minor Reservations Reviews documents carefully, raises one or two concerns, but fundamentally agrees. Signs the letter with perhaps small wording changes. Genuine partnership sealed. Discusses logistics—timing of delivery, who carries letters, coordination of messaging.

76-90: Full Agreement Sigismund sees exactly what he's hoped for. Signs enthusiastically after brief review. Adds his own weight to the letter with suggested phrases that strengthen it. Begins planning next steps—who to inform, how to coordinate with Basel allies. Real alliance formed.

91-100: Wholehearted Partnership This is the moment Sigismund has waited years for. Signs immediately, contributes his own insights to strengthen letter. Opens completely about his remaining leverage and contacts. Treats Juan as full equal in planning. Beginning of profound strategic alliance.

Deliberated Sigismund's negotiation stance and potential treaty modifications




Roll: 27/100 - Wants Modifications First

Sigismund takes the documents from the desk and reads through them slowly, methodically. The silence stretches. Fray Hernando stands motionless. Outside, full darkness has fallen over Como, and servants have lit candles without being asked.

Finally, Sigismund sets the papers down.

"The substance is good. Your delegation has done serious work." He looks at you. "But I won't sign a Castilian document. I'll sign an imperial-Castilian document. There's a difference."

He picks up a quill, dips it, begins marking passages.

"First. The electoral reform." He taps the relevant section. "This restores rights to cathedral chapters. Good. But in the German lands, the Emperor has traditional influence over certain episcopal appointments—Mainz, Cologne, Trier. The prince-electors. If this decree strips that influence entirely, I've just signed away imperial prerogatives that go back centuries."

He looks up at Fray Hernando.

"Can the language accommodate traditional imperial rights without gutting the reform? Something like 'respecting ancient privileges confirmed by prior councils'?"

Fray Hernando considers. "It would require careful drafting. But yes—Constance itself acknowledged certain secular privileges in elections. We could reference that precedent."

Sigismund nods, moves to the next marked passage.

"Second. Annates." He shakes his head. "Your position is too soft. 'Reduce and standardize' leaves Rome room to manipulate. The German princes have been screaming about annates for decades—it's one of the few issues where I have genuine support. I want stronger language. Not abolition—that goes too far—but meaningful caps. Specific numbers. No more 'reasonable fees to be determined by Rome.'"

He sets down the quill.

"Third. There's nothing here about the Hussites."

The word hangs in the air.

"I understand why. Your delegation is focused on universal reform, not Bohemian matters. But if I sign a joint declaration on Church reform and it says nothing about reconciliation with the Utraquists, my own subjects will ask why. The moderate Hussites came to Basel seeking dialogue. A reform declaration that ignores them looks like we're reforming around them rather than for them."

He stands, pacing.

"I'm not asking you to endorse communion in both kinds—that's a theological matter for the Council. But some language acknowledging that reform should open paths to reconciliation with those who strayed due to legitimate grievances..." He gestures vaguely. "Something that signals we understand why Bohemia rebelled, even if we don't endorse how."

Sigismund turns back to you.

"Make these changes, and I'll sign tonight. We draft the letter to Eugenius together—your visit, our shared commitment, the parallel legislation proposal. We draft a second letter to our allies at Basel—Cesarini, the German moderates, whoever your delegation trusts."

He extends his hand toward the documents.

"But I won't put my name to someone else's work and call it partnership. If we do this, we do it together. Both our hands on the quill."

He looks at you directly.

"Can you accept modifications? Or did you come here expecting me to simply agree?"

Absolutely, lets develop a position together. 

First, explain to me how the election of prince-electors work in bishoprics. And what influence the emperor has in this process. 

Do you support communion in both kinds? I do if it is achievable. 

Lets also research how annates actually work so we can adopt specific language.

Synthesized ecclesiastical governance, papal finances, and religious compromise trajectories











Sigismund settles back, a hint of approval in his expression. "You want to understand the machinery before you sign. Good. That's how alliances should work."

He gestures to Fray Hernando. "Bring more candles. This will take time."

As servants add light to the darkening chamber, Sigismund begins.

"First—the prince-electors and imperial influence."

"The three ecclesiastical electors—Mainz, Trier, Cologne—are elected by their cathedral chapters. Legally, Rome confirms them, the chapters choose them. The Emperor has no formal role."

He holds up a finger.

"But formally and actually are different things. These three archbishops are also imperial princes—they hold vast territories, command armies, collect tolls. The Archbishop of Mainz is Archchancellor of Germany. He presides over imperial elections. When I need something done in the Empire, I work through Mainz."

Sigismund leans forward.

"So while I cannot appoint these archbishops, I have... influence. The cathedral chapters know that an archbishop who cannot work with the Emperor is an archbishop with problems. Families seeking these positions cultivate imperial favor. It's informal, but it's real."

He taps the electoral reform document.

"If this decree strips all secular influence from episcopal elections, I lose leverage I've spent decades building. I'm not asking to appoint archbishops—that would gut the reform entirely. I'm asking for language that acknowledges 'ancient privileges confirmed by prior councils.' Constance itself recognized certain traditional rights. We reference that precedent, and the reform still accomplishes its purpose while not stripping me of all influence overnight."

"Second—communion in both kinds."

Sigismund is quiet for a moment. When he speaks, his voice is heavier.

"Do I support it? Juan, I've spent thirty-five years trying to destroy the Hussites for demanding it. Five crusades. Tens of thousands dead. My own reputation ruined in Bohemia because I let Jan Hus burn at Constance after promising him safe conduct."

He stands, moves to the window.

"And now? Now I'm negotiating with Basel to grant communion in both kinds to the Bohemians. The Compactata being drafted right now—this very month—will concede exactly what five crusades failed to prevent."

He turns back.

"Is it theologically sound? I don't know. I'm not a theologian. The Council of Constance said Christ is entirely present in the bread alone—concomitance, they call it. So denying the cup doesn't deny Christ's blood. That's the official position."

His voice hardens.

"But here's what I do know. The moderate Hussites—the Utraquists—are sincere Catholics who want reconciliation with Rome. If we grant them the cup, they'll accept papal authority on everything else. They'll help us crush the Taborite radicals. They'll bring Bohemia back into the fold."

He returns to his seat.

"So yes, I support it—not as theology, but as policy. If communion in both kinds ends thirty-five years of war, it's a small price. The question is whether Rome will accept it as a local exception for Bohemia, or whether they'll see it as surrender to heresy."

"Third—annates."

Sigismund nods to Fray Hernando. "Your friar can confirm the details, but here's how it works."

"When a bishop or abbot receives his office from Rome, he pays a fee—roughly half the first year's revenue. For major benefices, this goes to the papal treasury and the cardinals split it. These are called servitia communia. For minor benefices appointed by the Pope, the full payment goes to the Apostolic Camera. There are also smaller fees—servitia minuta—paid to various Curia officials."

He grimaces.

"The amounts are enormous. A wealthy bishopric might owe thousands of florins. The new bishop often has to borrow—from Italian bankers, usually—and spend years paying off the debt. Meanwhile, Rome keeps careful records. The Apostolic Camera knows exactly what every benefice in Christendom is worth."

Fray Hernando interjects quietly: "The Council of Constance set a minimum threshold. Benefices worth less than twenty-four gold florins annually are exempt from annates."

Sigismund nods. "But anything above that threshold pays. And here's the problem: Rome sets the valuations. They can assess a benefice at whatever they claim it's worth. Disputes are endless."

He looks at you directly.

"The German princes have been screaming about annates for decades. It's one of the few issues where I have genuine support across factions. Your Castilian document says 'reduce and standardize.' I want specific caps. Perhaps: annates cannot exceed one-quarter of the first year's revenue, assessed by the local bishop rather than Rome. Something concrete that actually limits papal extraction."

He spreads his hands.

"Give me that language, and I can tell my princes I won something real. 'Reduce and standardize' sounds like Rome will keep doing whatever it wants."

Sigismund looks between you and Fray Hernando.

"So. Three issues. Imperial privileges in episcopal elections—can we find language that preserves reform while acknowledging traditional rights? Communion in both kinds—are you willing to support it as a path to Bohemian reconciliation? And annates—can we strengthen the language to give it actual teeth?"

He picks up his quill.

"If we can agree on these, we draft tonight."

Explain to me how the new proposed electoral system would work and how you would lose influence. It seems like you have no influence in actual elections but that candidates with a strong relationship with you are at an advantage. 

Regarding communion in both kinds. A strong choice to now support it if it brings Bohemia back into the church. I understand that this is not easy, but it shows character. 

Regarding the annates, I would support one-quarter as max for titles. But I doubt letting the local bishop set the worth might swing corruption in the other dirtection. Should we support also a reform of the apostolic camera and let the assess correctly. I am yttraining assessors in my own kingdom and we should support the camera to not abuse their office to levy ovberly grand proportions. Would this be acceptable?

Analyzed electoral reform nuances and crafted nuanced diplomatic responses








Sigismund pauses, considering your question about electoral reform carefully.

"You're right to press me on this. Let me be more precise."

He stands, pacing as he thinks.

"The electoral system—current and proposed."

"Currently, cathedral chapters technically elect their bishops. But over the past century, Rome has increasingly used 'papal provisions' and 'reservations'—claiming the right to directly appoint bishops, bypassing chapters entirely. A pope might 'reserve' a see to himself before the previous bishop even dies. When it falls vacant, Rome appoints whoever they choose. The chapter's election becomes a formality, or is ignored altogether."

He gestures at the reform document.

"This decree ends that practice. Chapters regain genuine electoral power. No more papal provisions overriding local choice. That's good reform—I support it."

Sigismund returns to his seat, speaking more carefully now.

"My influence works through both systems. When chapters elect freely, I cultivate relationships with the canons—the men who vote. When Rome appoints directly, I negotiate with the Pope. I've used both channels for decades."

He pauses.

"My concern is not the substance of the reform. It's the language. If the decree says something like 'no secular prince shall interfere in episcopal elections,' that formally excludes me from even informal influence. It makes my traditional relationships look like violations of canon law."

He looks at you directly.

"What I want is silence on secular rulers—neither endorsing nor forbidding our traditional relationships. The reform targets papal overreach, not imperial custom. If the language focuses on ending provisions and reservations without explicitly banning all secular involvement, I lose nothing I shouldn't lose."

He turns to Fray Hernando. "Does the Castilian text address secular rulers specifically, or does it focus on papal practices?"

Fray Hernando reviews the document. "The Session Twelve decree focuses primarily on ending papal provisions and restoring chapter elections. It does not explicitly address secular princes' traditional influence, though some interpretations—"

"Some interpretations could read it either way," Sigismund finishes. "That's the problem. I want language that cannot be interpreted against imperial custom. A reference to 'respecting privileges confirmed at Constance' would accomplish that."

"On communion in both kinds."

Sigismund's expression softens slightly at your words.

"Character." He repeats the word quietly. "Perhaps. Or perhaps just exhaustion. Thirty-five years of watching men die over whether laymen drink from the cup."

He's silent for a moment.

"But thank you. If Castile supports this position, it strengthens my hand at Basel. The French will oppose it—they want the Hussites crushed, not reconciled. Having a king who actually won a crusade speak for compromise..." He nods slowly. "That carries weight."

"On annates."

Sigismund listens to your counter-proposal, his expression shifting from skepticism to grudging interest.

"Reform the Apostolic Camera itself." He turns the idea over. "You're right that local bishops assessing their own benefices invites a different corruption—undervaluation to curry favor, or overvaluation to harm rivals."

He drums his fingers on the table.

"But reforming the Camera... that's asking Rome to police itself. The Camera has been extracting money from Christendom for two centuries. Their entire purpose is maximizing papal revenue. You're proposing we tell them to... extract less, more fairly?"

Fray Hernando speaks up. "The Council has already passed provisions on Camera reform. Session Twelve addresses abuses in the collection of papal revenues. The machinery exists—the question is enforcement."

Sigismund considers this.

"Alright. One-quarter maximum—that's concrete, that's enforceable. On assessment, we don't shift authority to local bishops, but we demand transparency from the Camera. Published valuations. Right of appeal to a neutral body—perhaps the Council itself, or a standing commission. Assessments reviewed every... ten years? Twenty?"

He looks at you.

"If we frame it as reforming the Camera rather than circumventing it, Rome might actually accept it. They keep their authority, but with oversight. The Pope can claim he's cleaning his own house rather than having it cleaned for him."

He picks up the quill again.

"So: one-quarter cap, Camera retains assessment authority but with mandatory transparency, published valuations, and right of appeal. Does that satisfy your concern about shifting corruption while still giving the reform teeth?"

In regards to the elections; I think it is only natural that the election process takes into account the prominent and special relationship these bishops have with Germany and the Holy Roman Empire. Their function is after all not purely their bisdom alone, they have responsibilities beyond those of a normal bishop. Qualifications in these functions naturally should improve their chances of getting elected and I think our position should reflect that. 

Regarding reform of the camera, we encounter the same problem we have everywhere. Who controls or polices the church itself? 

I think we should establish the habit or precedent that if the men that make up an institution such as the apostolic camera are not performing the tasks correctly or without corruption, the council should dismiss every member of the organization. In time, every branch will know to be more carefull about corruption since the council can dismiss them. And the council can also start investigations or committees outside of sessions to streamline this process even further. And yes, this principle would apply to everyone, including popes. What do you think about this?

Weighed electoral compromise favorably while flagging radical conciliar authority implications










Sigismund nods slowly at your first point, genuine approval in his expression.

"On the electoral language—"

"Yes. That's well-framed. The prince-elector archbishops are not ordinary bishops. They're imperial officers. The Archbishop of Mainz is Archchancellor of Germany—he presides over imperial elections, manages imperial correspondence, holds one of the highest offices in the Empire. Trier and Cologne hold similar functions."

He leans forward.

"If we state that candidates for these positions should demonstrate qualifications for both their spiritual and their imperial responsibilities, we acknowledge reality without creating new powers. The chapters still elect. Rome still confirms. But the language recognizes that a man who cannot work with the Emperor is poorly suited for a position that requires working with the Emperor."

He makes a note.

"Good. We can draft that tonight."

"On the Camera and institutional oversight—"

Sigismund listens carefully to your proposal. His expression shifts—first interest, then something more cautious. He sets down his quill.

"Juan." His voice is measured. "An hour ago, you said we should stay away from Haec Sancta. Sidestep the question of papal versus conciliar authority."

He stands, moving to the window. The night is fully dark now, Como's lights reflecting on the lake.

"Now you're proposing that the Council should have power to dismiss any Church institution—including popes. That's not sidestepping the authority question. That is the authority question."

He turns back to face you.

"If the Council can dismiss the Pope, the Council is superior to the Pope. That's precisely what Haec Sancta claims. That's what the French faction at Basel has been fighting for. That's what Eugenius has been fighting against for two years."

Sigismund returns to his seat, his tone not hostile but serious.

"I understand the logic. Who watches the watchmen? If no one can hold corrupt institutions accountable, corruption flourishes. That's true." He pauses. "But think about what you're actually proposing."

He counts on his fingers.

"First: You want the Pope to adopt Council reforms through parallel legislation—presenting it as his initiative, not submission to Basel. That requires him to believe the Council respects papal authority."

"Second: You want to include language saying the Council can dismiss any institution, including popes. The moment Eugenius reads that, he sees a trap. He'll believe we're using 'reform' as a Trojan horse to establish conciliar supremacy."

"Third: The French will love this language—which should concern you. Cardinal Aleman wants to depose Eugenius. If our declaration sounds like we support his position, we've just taken sides in exactly the dispute we said we'd avoid."

Sigismund spreads his hands.

"I'm not saying you're wrong about the underlying problem. The Church does need accountability mechanisms. Corrupt institutions should face consequences. But there's a difference between—"

He pauses, searching for words.

"—between saying 'the Council may investigate and recommend reforms to correct institutional failures' and saying 'the Council may dismiss any institution including the Pope.' The first is oversight. The second is supremacy."

He looks at you directly.

"So here's my question: Do you actually want to take a position on Haec Sancta? Because if you do, I need to understand that before I sign anything. My strategy has been to keep both Pope and Council functioning—not to hand either one victory over the other."

"Or do you want institutional accountability without explicitly establishing conciliar supremacy over the papacy? Because that's a different document—harder to write, but possible."

He waits, genuinely curious how you'll answer.

You are right, I had just said that I want to keep neutral on Haec Sancta and this proposal would indeed indirectly come down to the same. 

The pope has already acknowledged Frequens, maybe after a successfull council in Basel, maybe in the next, he will acknowledge haec Sancta as well. For this council, this is not realistic. We should focus on reforms. One of those reforms are making sure the church polices itself. In that vein, we should support an initiative for internal checks in the church. If it is a church institution, it will not have the power to depose a pope. We should establish the system; a reform of the apostolic camera with reinforcement mechanisms against corruption. For this council, that should be enough.

26 nov 2025

Reconciled competing interests and refined pragmatic reform framework




Sigismund's tension eases visibly. He nods, something like respect in his expression.

"Good. You can adjust when you've overreached. That's rarer than you'd think in kings."

He returns to the table, pulling fresh parchment toward him.

"So. Internal mechanisms. The Church policing itself—but with actual teeth." He thinks for a moment. "The Camera answers to the Pope. If we create an oversight body that also answers to the Pope, we've accomplished nothing. The fox guarding the henhouse."

Fray Hernando speaks carefully. "There is precedent for mixed bodies. The Council of Constance established commissions with representatives from multiple nations and factions. They investigated specific abuses, reported findings, recommended actions. They had no power to compel—but their findings carried moral weight."

Sigismund picks up the thread. "So we propose a standing commission—appointed jointly by Pope and Council during sessions, continuing between sessions. They audit the Camera. Investigate complaints. Publish findings."

He taps the table.

"No power to dismiss the Pope. No power to overrule papal decisions. But if they find corruption, they publish it. They name names. They document abuses for all Christendom to see."

A grim smile.

"Sunlight as enforcement. Corrupt officials can't be removed by the commission, but they can be exposed. Let public shame do what legal authority cannot—at least until the Church is ready for stronger medicine."

He looks at you.

"For this Council, that's achievable. It establishes the principle of accountability without claiming supremacy. Future councils can strengthen the mechanism once the precedent exists."

Sigismund begins writing notes.

"So—our framework. Electoral reform with language acknowledging imperial functions. Support for communion in both kinds for Bohemian reconciliation. Annates capped at one-quarter with Camera transparency and appeal rights. And a standing oversight commission for institutional accountability."

He looks up.

"Can we draft tonight? I have two more days in Como. If we leave with letters ready—one to Eugenius, one to our allies at Basel—we've accomplished something real."

Fray? Can you draft this document tonight? 

Emperor? Should we include anything more about what we should do together to give this position some teeth? Should we include something that both of us are committed to work together to ensure church unity through these reforms?

26 nov 2025

Weighed diplomatic feasibility and negotiated enforcement mechanisms







Fray Hernando bows his head. "I can have a working draft by morning, Your Majesty. The substance is clear—it's a matter of finding precise language that accomplishes our goals without triggering the concerns we've discussed."

He glances at the notes Sigismund has been making. "If His Imperial Majesty permits, I would work from those notes alongside our delegation's documents. The Emperor's concerns about electoral language and annates specificity are well-taken—better to address them in the initial draft than negotiate amendments later."

Sigismund slides the notes across. "Take them. I'll have my secretary available if you need clarification on German precedents."

Sigismund turns to your second question, his expression thoughtful.

"Teeth." He considers the word. "What does that actually mean between two rulers separated by a thousand miles?"

He stands, moving to a map hanging on the chamber wall—a rough depiction of Europe, the kind wealthy merchants keep for trade routes.

"Here is Castile." His finger traces the Iberian peninsula. "Here is the Empire." A sweep across German lands, Bohemia, Hungary. "Between us—France, Burgundy, the Italian states. We share no border. Our armies cannot support each other directly. If Eugenius refuses our reforms, I cannot march on Rome, and neither can you."

He turns back.

"So what can we do together?"

Sigismund returns to the table, counting possibilities.

"First: diplomatic coordination. We speak with one voice. Letters delivered simultaneously. Ambassadors instructed to reinforce each other's positions. If the Pope hears the same message from Vienna and Toledo on the same day, he knows this isn't one king's hobby—it's a coalition."

"Second: economic pressure. The Church depends on revenue from our lands. If we instruct our clergy to delay annate payments pending reform... that's leverage. Not refusal—delay. 'We support the Holy Father, but our bishops require clarity on the new assessment procedures before they can calculate what they owe.' Bureaucratic obstruction in service of reform."

A harder edge enters his voice.

"Third: the implicit threat. We don't need to say it directly, but Eugenius knows: if Pope and Council split into open schism, secular rulers choose which pope to recognize. If we signal that our support for him depends on reform, he understands the alternative. We don't threaten—we simply remind him that unity requires compromise from everyone."

He sits back.

"Fourth: Basel itself. Your delegation remains there. I'll return there within weeks. If we coordinate with the German moderates, Cardinal Cesarini, whatever reasonable Italians remain—we build a reform faction that neither French radicals nor papal hardliners can ignore. Weight of numbers."

Sigismund looks at you directly.

"Should we include language about commitment? Yes—but carefully. Something like: 'We pledge to coordinate our efforts in support of these reforms, to encourage their adoption by all Christian princes, and to work toward Church unity through genuine reform rather than factional victory.'"

He pauses.

"What we don't say publicly is the harder question. Are we willing to recognize a Council-elected pope if Eugenius refuses reform entirely and Basel deposes him? Are we willing to withhold recognition from Eugenius if he tries to dissolve Basel again?"

His eyes are sharp.

"Those are the real teeth, Juan. The ultimate leverage. I'm not asking you to answer tonight—but you should think about where your limits are. How far are you willing to go if the Pope chooses confrontation over compromise?"

And while we dont share borders directly, My alliance stretches from Iberia to Naples in Italy. With the Imperial states to his north and My alliance to the south, the pope is right in between us. He would do well to have a good relationship with us. 

Fray: Start drafting our position in a statement we both can sign. We will then write seperate letters to our delegations and allies and to the pope. But the statement as a seperate document signed by both of us will be a powerfull statement.

26 nov 2025

Orchestrated diplomatic strategy and delegated document drafting tasks






Sigismund's expression shifts. He looks at you with new appreciation.

"Castile, Aragon, Naples." He traces the geography in his mind. "The western Mediterranean. And if Alfonso secures Naples with your support and papal recognition..."

He moves back to the map, finger tracing the positions.

"The Papal States. Here." He taps central Italy. "To the north—my imperial territories, the German princes, Austria. To the south—your alliance. Naples controls the approaches from the south. Aragon holds Sicily, Sardinia, the Balearics. Castile commands the Atlantic and the western Mediterranean."

He turns back, a glint in his eye.

"Eugenius sits in Rome with the Colonna threatening him from within, Milan's condottieri raiding his borders, and now two of Christendom's most powerful rulers coordinating reform demands from north and south."

A dry laugh.

"You're right. He would do very well to maintain good relationships with us. And if we frame our letter correctly—supportive, cooperative, emphasizing our desire to help him lead reform rather than have it imposed on him—he may see partnership as his best option."

Sigismund extends his hand to you.

"Then we're agreed. A joint declaration. Both signatures. Let it be known that Emperor and King stand together."

Fray Hernando has been listening carefully. He gathers the notes and documents, his expression focused.

"Your Majesties. I understand the task. A formal declaration—a statement of shared principles—signed by both of you. Then separate letters: to our delegations at Basel, to allied cardinals and princes, and to His Holiness Pope Eugenius."

He pauses, considering.

"For the declaration itself, I have a question of tone. Do we frame this as a petition to the Holy Father—humble subjects requesting reform? Or as a statement of position—two rulers announcing what they support and expect?"

He looks between you and Sigismund.

"The first is softer, more traditionally deferential. The second is stronger, makes clear this is a coordinated stance that will not easily bend. The Pope will read the tone as carefully as the substance."

Sigismund glances at you, deferring.

"Your friar asks the right question. How do we wish to present ourselves?"

Statement of position. We cannot afford another scism. Either we reform or we will be fighting crusades against christians for the rest of our lives. I think we should signal that we are serious. That there is too much at stake otherwise. And I think our alliance has the political power is strong enough for a statement of of petition to be taken seriously. Do you agree?

26 nov 2025

Weighed diplomatic risks against alliance strength and reform urgency







Sigismund is quiet for a moment. The candles flicker. Outside, Como sleeps.

Then he nods slowly.

"You're right. A petition from Emperor and King—from men who command between us half of Christendom's military strength—would look like uncertainty. Like we're asking permission rather than stating necessity."

He stands, moving to the window one final time. When he speaks, his voice is heavier.

"I've spent two years trying to mediate. Gentle letters. Careful diplomacy. 'Holy Father, perhaps you might consider...' 'Venerable Council fathers, if it please you to examine...'" He shakes his head. "And what has it accomplished? Nothing. They're still at each other's throats. Still more concerned with winning than with the Church surviving."

He turns back, and there's iron in his expression now.

"You completed a crusade while I wrote letters. Perhaps it's time I remembered that emperors are supposed to lead, not beg."

Sigismund returns to the table and sits heavily.

"Statement of position. We support these reforms. We expect the Church to adopt them. We commit to working together to see them implemented. And we make clear—without explicit threat, but unmistakably—that Christian unity depends on genuine reform, not factional victory."

He looks at Fray Hernando.

"Frame it as duty, not demand. We speak not as adversaries of the Holy Father, but as Christian rulers who cannot watch the Church tear itself apart. Our position is firm because the alternative is unthinkable—not because we seek to diminish papal authority."

Fray Hernando nods, making notes. "Firm in substance, respectful in form. The strength comes from the signatures and the coordination, not from aggressive language."

"Exactly." Sigismund turns to you. "We stand together because we must, not because we wish to threaten. Let Eugenius understand that this is not politics—this is survival. His and ours."

He extends his hand across the table.

"Then we are agreed, Juan of Castile. Draft tonight. Review tomorrow. Sign before you leave Como."

A pause. Something shifts in his weathered face—not quite warmth, but perhaps the beginning of it.

"I have waited a long time to find a king who understands what's actually at stake. Who acts instead of talks. Who listens when he's wrong and adjusts." He clasps your hand firmly. "Perhaps God has not abandoned the cause of Christian unity entirely."

He releases your hand and gestures to Fray Hernando.

"Go. Write. We'll reconvene at first light."

Fray Hernando gathers the documents and bows to both of you. At the door, he pauses.

"Your Majesties. This declaration—if it works—may be remembered for generations. If it fails..." He doesn't finish the sentence. "I will write carefully."

He departs. The chamber falls quiet.

Sigismund pours two cups of wine and slides one to you.

"Now. While your friar writes, tell me about Constantinople. You've committed a thousand knights and sixty thousand florins. I received Emperor John's appeals years ago—sent what I could spare, which wasn't much." He drinks. "What's your actual plan? Defend the walls until the Ottomans lose interest? Buy time for a broader crusade? Or something more ambitious?"

Even if I consolidate my alliance and unite them in the defence of Constantinople, it still will not be enough. The florins and the men buys them some time. Time to think about what to do next. Actually beating the Ottomans requires a massive effort. And it is really up to Constantinople if they will want to make that effort. I have also offered them sanctuary and the right to settle lands in Castille. But it would mean leaving Constantinople. I dont know what they will say when I visit them later this year.

26 nov 2025

Orchestrated realistic dialogue between pragmatic rulers confronting Ottoman limitations





Sigismund drinks slowly, considering your words. The late hour and the wine have softened something in him—this is no longer negotiation, but two tired rulers talking honestly.

"Sanctuary in Castile." He turns the idea over. "That's... not what I expected. Most kings who talk about Constantinople imagine themselves riding through the Golden Gate as liberators. You're offering them an escape route."

He sets down his cup.

"It's realistic. I'll grant you that. More realistic than anything I've heard from Rome or Basel." A pause. "But you're right—they won't take it. Not yet. Perhaps not ever."

Sigismund stares into his wine.

"I've dealt with the Palaiologoi for decades. Proud beyond reason. They still call themselves Basileus Rhomaion—Emperor of the Romans. They believe Constantinople is the center of the world, the Second Rome, the city God himself protects. Their empire has been dying for two hundred years, and still they believe God will save them at the last moment."

He looks up.

"They'll fight. They'll die on those walls rather than abandon them. It's who they are. The only way they leave Constantinople is if Constantinople ceases to exist—and by then, there won't be many left to resettle anywhere."

A heavy silence.

"As for actually defeating the Ottomans..." Sigismund shakes his head. "I have one commander who understands how to fight them. János Hunyadi. Transylvanian. Brilliant tactician. He's won victories no one thought possible—small ones, but real. He knows their methods, their weaknesses."

He leans forward.

"Hunyadi tells me the same thing you just said. It requires a massive effort. Unified command. Thirty-five, forty thousand professional soldiers—not feudal levies who go home after one season. Supply lines through Hungary. Years of sustained campaign, not one glorious charge."

Sigismund laughs bitterly.

"Do you know what I told him? 'János, I can't get the German princes to agree on anything for more than six months. I can't get the Pope and Council to stop fighting each other long enough to declare a crusade. Where am I supposed to find forty thousand men and the gold to feed them for years?'"

He refills both cups.

"So. Your thousand knights buy time. Your florins repair walls. And then?" He gestures vaguely eastward. "The Sultan masses his forces. The walls hold for a year, maybe two, maybe five if God is merciful. And then one day they don't hold. And Constantinople falls. And the Ottomans stand at Hungary's doorstep with nothing between them and Vienna."

He drinks deeply.

"That's the future I see, Juan. Unless something changes. Unless someone actually unites Christendom—not in words, but in action. Pope and Council. Emperor and kings. Hungary and Poland and Venice and Genoa and Castile and Aragon and whoever else can be dragged into it."

His eyes meet yours.

"You've done something I couldn't do. You united Castile, finished the Reconquista, built an alliance stretching to Naples. You made the impossible happen once."

He sets down his cup.

"Can you do it again? Can anyone?"

I will try. But I cannot change the hearts of others. If they are too proud and stubborn to see reason, I will not fight for them. I will not bleed my men for those who will not save themselves. A lost cause. If they are indeed too proud and want to die on their walls, then I cannot turn them. 

But I am ready. I can command my navy to go toe to toe with theirs, and my armies do not fear them. I do not fear them. If they are truly ready for the fight for their culture, their city and their empire, then so will I be ready to come to their aid and I will speak with you again. We will need to unite as christians and drive Islam from the eastern side of the european continent. I have done it already in the west, now we should do the same in the east. 

But I will first have to speak with them. I will keep you updated sir. This concerns us both.

26 nov 2025

Orchestrated character dynamics and crafted respectful diplomatic response





Sigismund is silent for a long moment. The candles have burned low. Somewhere in the palace, a clock chimes the late hour.

When he speaks, his voice is quieter than before.

"'I will not bleed my men for those who will not save themselves.'" He repeats your words slowly. "That's... that's what I should have said thirty-five years ago. About Bohemia. About a dozen other hopeless causes I threw men into because honor demanded it, or pride, or stubbornness."

He looks at you with something new in his expression. Not warmth exactly—Sigismund is too old and too scarred for easy warmth—but recognition. The look of a man who has finally found someone who speaks his language.

"You've already done it in the west. Sixty years of my life, Juan—sixty years—and I've never seen a Christian king actually finish what he started. They talk about crusades. They raise armies. They march out with banners flying. And then... winter comes, or the treasury empties, or they quarrel with their allies, or they simply lose interest. The crusade dissolves. Nothing changes."

He stands, moving stiffly—the hour and the wine and the years all weighing on him.

"You didn't just talk. You conquered Granada. You ended the Reconquista. Eight hundred years of war, and you finished it." He shakes his head slowly. "And now you sit here telling me you'll do the same in the East—if Constantinople wants to be saved."

Sigismund moves to the door, then pauses, his hand on the frame.

"Keep me informed. When you've spoken with Emperor John, when you know whether they'll fight or merely die with dignity—write to me. If there's a real chance, if Constantinople chooses to live rather than simply to fall gloriously..."

He turns back.

"Then you'll have Hungary at your side. What's left of my strength, whatever years I have remaining. Hunyadi and his tactics. The weight of the imperial title, for whatever that's worth anymore."

A ghost of a smile crosses his weathered face.

"I'm sixty-five years old, Juan. I've failed at almost everything I've attempted. Bohemia. The Church. Holding the Empire together. But perhaps..." He pauses. "Perhaps God has kept me alive this long to see one thing through. To find one ally who actually means what he says."

He straightens, some of the imperial dignity returning.

"We sign tomorrow. Then you ride to your wife, and I ride to Basel. And after that—Constantinople, Rome, whatever comes next."

Sigismund opens the door.

"Sleep if you can. Fray Hernando will have the draft by morning. And Juan—"

He looks back one final time.

"Thank you. For riding three days through the Alps to meet an old man on the road. For listening. For being honest about what you can and cannot do."

A pause.

"I think perhaps we understand each other."

He departs, his footsteps fading down the corridor.

The chamber falls silent. Through the window, the first hint of gray touches the eastern sky over the lake. Somewhere below, you can hear Fray Hernando's voice, quietly dictating to a scribe.

What do you do?

GM: Create a document that includes the statement signed by both sigismund and me about our position on church reform. 

Include also the accompanying letters to both the pope and my delegation in Basel.

Architected three formal documents articulating unified reform positions




I'll create these documents with authentic 15th-century formatting and style.


Assembled diplomatic documents and prepared delivery link



I have drafted the documents.

View the Declaration of Como and accompanying letters

The package includes:

The Declaration of Como - A formal joint statement with six articles covering:

Pluralism and absenteeism reform
Episcopal elections (with language protecting imperial prerogatives for prince-electors)
Annates (one-quarter cap, Camera transparency, right of appeal)
Institutional accountability commission
Bohemian reconciliation and communion in both kinds
Joint commitment to coordinate efforts
Letter to Pope Eugenius IV - Respectful but firm, framing the parallel legislation proposal as a way for him to lead reform rather than submit to it, and announcing your planned visit after Isabel's delivery.

Letter to the Castilian Delegation - Instructions to coordinate with German moderates, support the reforms, maintain neutrality on Haec Sancta, and keep you informed of developments.

The tone throughout is "statement of position" as you requested—firm in substance while remaining formally respectful. The documents make clear this is a coordinated stance from two of Christendom's most powerful secular rulers, without explicit threats but with unmistakable weight behind them.

Chapter 2.8 Complete.

A pivotal chapter—Juan rode three days through the Alps to intercept an exhausted Emperor, and through honest dialogue transformed skepticism into genuine alliance. The Declaration of Como establishes a coordinated reform position between Empire and Castile, with the Pope geographically surrounded by allied powers.

Key moments:

Juan admitting his Bohemian knowledge was "second-hand at best"—Sigismund: "Do you know how rare that is? To hear a king admit he doesn't know something?"
Juan recognizing when he overreached on institutional accountability and adjusting
Sigismund's final words: "I think perhaps we understand each other."
The road home awaits. Isabel's delivery approaches. And then—Rome, to see if Eugenius will accept the hand extended to him, or choose confrontation.
