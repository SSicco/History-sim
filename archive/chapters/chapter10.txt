Hi, 

This is chapter 2.10

I have just concluded my meeting with Alvaro and go to Isabel to spend the night with her for the first time since leaving for Rome and Basel.

Orchestrated intimate reunion scene balancing emotional vulnerability and tender reconnection























CHAPTER 2.10
The Vigil
June 22, 1433 — Evening Alcázar of Toledo

The meeting with Álvaro concluded as the last light faded from the study windows. Toledo's summer heat had softened into evening warmth, the thick stone walls of the Alcázar finally releasing the day's accumulated weight. Servants moved quietly through corridors, lighting candles and opening casements to admit what breeze might stir from the river below.

The walk to the royal chambers took only moments—the route memorized from years of habit—yet felt unfamiliar after so many months abroad. Different tapestries hung in the corridor. A bust he didn't recognize. Some functionary had been making improvements in his absence.

The guard at Isabel's door—a grizzled veteran who'd served Juan's father—offered a respectful nod and opened the heavy oak without announcement. There was no need. The Queen expected him.

The chamber was lit by candles clustered on the window ledge, their flames dancing in the faint breeze. Isabel sat at her dressing table, Doña Beatriz having just finished braiding her hair for the night. The Portuguese lady-in-waiting looked up as Juan entered, curtsied smoothly, and withdrew without a word—closing the door softly behind her.

Isabel watched him in the polished silver mirror as he approached. She wore a simple linen shift, white against her olive skin, her pregnant belly visible now without the formal gowns of the day. Seventeen months since Catalina. Seven months along, perhaps a little more. The physicians' warnings hung in the air like smoke from the candles.

"She finally fell asleep," Isabel said, meaning Catalina. "She was asking for Pa until her eyes closed. I think she's decided you're allowed to stay."

She turned on the little stool to face him. In the candlelight, the terror that had consumed her earlier—the raw confession of mortality and fear—had given way to something quieter. Exhaustion, perhaps. The relief of having finally spoken the unspeakable. Or simply the bone-deep weariness of a pregnant woman who had spent months pretending she wasn't afraid.

Her eyes found his.

"I rehearsed this moment a hundred times while you were gone. What I would say. How I would look. Whether I would cry or be brave." A small, self-deprecating smile touched her lips. "All those rehearsals, and when you actually arrived, I couldn't say anything at all. I just... managed."

She extended her hand toward him—a simple gesture, palm upward, fingers slightly curled.

"I don't want to manage anymore tonight. Not with you. Just... come here."

Where is Catalina now?

Pinpointed character location from narrative context





Isabel glances toward the interior door that leads deeper into the royal apartments.

"In the nursery, just through there. The wet-nurse is with her—she'll sleep through the night now, God willing. She exhausted herself asking for you."

A soft laugh. "Doña Beatriz said she kept pointing at the door and saying Pa until she simply couldn't keep her eyes open anymore. I think she was afraid you'd disappear again if she stopped watching for you."

Do you let her sleep with you in bed? Or is she sleeping alone?

Contextualized medieval childcare customs within character's emotional circumstances



Isabel shakes her head. "She sleeps in the nursery with her nurse. It's... it's what's proper. What the physicians recommend." A pause. "And truthfully, with the pregnancy so far along, I wake at every small movement. She'd never get proper rest."

But something in her expression suggests there's more.

"There were nights, though. After you left for Rome. When I would have her brought to me anyway." She looks down at her hands. "I told myself it was for her comfort. That she missed you and needed her mother close. But I think... I think I needed to hold something. Someone."

She meets his eyes again.

"The nursery is close. If she wakes, if she cries—I hear her. I always hear her."

Can I look at her right now? I would love to just watch her sleep.

26 nov 2025

Orchestrated tender family moment, deferred subsequent narrative choices



Isabel's face softens with something like wonder—as if this simple request, this desire to watch their daughter sleep, confirms something she needed to believe about him.

"Of course," she says quietly. She rises from the stool, moving with the careful deliberation of late pregnancy, and takes his hand. "Come."

The nursery adjoins the royal chambers through a small antechamber. Isabel opens the door slowly, silently, with the practiced care of a mother who has done this a hundred times without waking the child within.

The room is dim, lit only by a single candle in a glass housing on the far table. The wet-nurse—a sturdy woman from a village near Talavera—dozes in a chair by the window, her breathing soft and even. She stirs slightly at the door's movement but doesn't wake.

And there, in a small carved bed with low rails to keep her from rolling, lies Catalina.

She sleeps on her back, arms thrown wide in that peculiar abandon only small children possess—complete surrender to unconsciousness. Her dark hair, Isabel's hair, curls damply at her temples. Her lips are slightly parted, and in the candlelight Juan can see the tiny rise and fall of her chest beneath the light blanket.

Seventeen months old. Walking now. Speaking a few words. Pa.

She is so small. So impossibly small. And yet in the soft curve of her cheek, the set of her brow even in sleep, he can see echoes—of Isabel, of his own mother, of bloodlines stretching back through centuries of Castilian kings and Portuguese queens.

This afternoon she pulled his beard and laughed. She called him Pa and fell asleep against his chest.

Isabel stands beside him in the doorway, her hand still in his, watching him watch their daughter.

I watch her for a moment longer, then gently tuck her in. 

Then I go back to Isabel and we both go to bed. 

What happens in the morning?

Orchestrated intimate scene transition and mapped morning narrative possibilities






Juan lingers a moment longer, memorizing the sight—the impossible smallness of her fingers curled against the blanket, the soft rhythm of her breathing. Then he reaches down and gently adjusts the light cover, tucking it around her small form without waking her. His hand hovers briefly over her hair, not quite touching, before he withdraws.

Catalina sighs in her sleep and turns her head slightly. Nothing more.

He returns to Isabel, takes her hand again, and together they walk back to the royal chamber. No words are needed. The candles have burned lower. Toledo is quiet beyond the windows.

What passes between them that night is private—the reunion of husband and wife after months of separation, tender and careful given Isabel's condition, but real. Present. The fear doesn't disappear, but for a few hours it recedes, replaced by something warmer.

June 23, 1433 — Morning

Juan wakes to summer light filtering through the casements and the distant sound of the city stirring below. Isabel still sleeps beside him, her breathing deep and even, one hand resting on the swell of her belly.

He lies still for a moment, unwilling to disturb her.

Then, from somewhere in the Alcázar, he hears the familiar sounds of a palace coming to life—servants in corridors, the clatter of the kitchens, a door opening and closing. And voices. Hushed but urgent.

A soft knock comes at the outer door of the antechamber. Doña Beatriz's voice, carefully modulated: "Your Majesty? Forgive the intrusion. Don Álvaro sends word—there are matters requiring attention when you are ready. Nothing urgent, he says, but... accumulated correspondence. And the Masters of Santiago and Calatrava have sent riders ahead. They will arrive sooner than expected. Perhaps within the week."

Great. Tell Alvaro I will meet with him after midday. 

I get up and go to Catalina.

26 nov 2025

Orchestrated character priorities, balancing duty with familial devotion


"Tell Don Álvaro I will meet with him after midday," Juan calls softly through the door, keeping his voice low enough not to wake Isabel. "The matters have waited this long. They can wait a few hours more."

"Yes, Your Majesty." Doña Beatriz's footsteps retreat down the corridor.

Juan dresses quietly—simple clothes, nothing formal—and slips through the antechamber to the nursery.

The wet-nurse is awake now, seated by the window with morning light streaming in, but Catalina's bed is empty. For a moment his heart lurches—then he hears the giggling.

His daughter is on the floor near the foot of the bed, engaged in serious negotiations with a wooden horse that has seen better days. She holds it by one leg and appears to be explaining something to it with great conviction in a language composed entirely of sounds that are not quite words.

She looks up when the door opens.

Her face transforms—eyes widening, mouth opening into a perfect circle of surprise and delight. She drops the horse immediately and begins the laborious process of getting to her feet, arms windmilling for balance.

"Pa!"

She toddles toward him with the determined, slightly drunken gait of a child who has only recently mastered walking—arms outstretched, grinning with all six of her teeth.

The wet-nurse rises and curtsies, but Juan waves her back to her seat without looking away from his daughter.

Catalina!

I pick her up and hold her high. 

Come, lets wake mama. 

I let her jump around the room again and then with one giant jump, I fly her to Isabel's sleeping face so she can kiss her mom awake.

26 nov 2025

Envisioned tender family moment, prioritized warmth and intimacy


Catalina shrieks with delight as Juan sweeps her up and holds her high above his head. Her small hands grab at the air, at his face, at anything within reach. "Pa! Pa!"

"Come," he says, grinning up at her. "Let's wake Mama."

He swoops her down, then up again—the flying game from yesterday, instantly remembered. Catalina's laughter fills the nursery, bright and uncomplicated, the purest sound in the world. The wet-nurse watches with an indulgent smile, making no move to interfere.

Juan carries his daughter through the antechamber, banking her around corners like a ship in full sail. She extends her arms, a tiny figurehead cutting through imaginary waves. Down she goes—up she goes—a brief stop to inspect a tapestry ("Bird!" she announces, pointing at what is clearly a lion)—and then onward to the royal chamber.

The door is still ajar. Inside, Isabel sleeps on, morning light now fully illuminating her face, her dark hair spread across the pillow.

"Ready?" Juan whispers to Catalina.

She nods solemnly, not understanding but committed to whatever conspiracy this might be.

One great swooping arc around the room—Catalina's feet nearly brushing the canopy—and then Juan brings her in low over the bed, descending toward Isabel's face like a very small, very giggly falcon.

"Mama!" Catalina cries, and plants a wet, enthusiastic kiss directly on Isabel's nose.

Isabel's eyes fly open.

I give Isabel a kiss as well and sit at the edge of the bed with Catalina. I let her explore the sheets and the pillows.

26 nov 2025

Orchestrated tender family scene with warm narration


Isabel's startled expression melts into something soft and unguarded—the face of a woman woken not by fear or duty but by her daughter's kiss and her husband's smile. She reaches up, still half-asleep, and touches Juan's cheek as he leans down to kiss her properly.

"Good morning," she murmurs against his lips.

Then Catalina demands attention by grabbing a fistful of her mother's hair.

"Mama!" she announces again, as if the first declaration hadn't been sufficient.

Juan settles onto the edge of the bed, releasing his daughter into the landscape of linen and down. Catalina immediately sets about conquering this new territory with the seriousness of a general surveying a battlefield. She crawls across the sheets, investigates a pillow by pressing her face into it, emerges with her hair wild, and then discovers that blankets can be pulled.

Isabel props herself up against the headboard, watching their daughter with sleepy amusement. "She's been doing this every morning. The pillows are enemy fortresses, I think. Yesterday she spent ten minutes trying to defeat that one." She points to a bolster near the foot of the bed.

Catalina, as if understanding she's being discussed, looks up from her exploration and grins. Then she finds the edge of a sheet, pulls it over her head, and goes very still—apparently believing herself invisible.

A small giggle emerges from beneath the linen.

I tickle the bundle under the linens.

26 nov 2025

Envisioned playful intimacy and joyful family interaction

The bundle shrieks.

Catalina explodes from beneath the sheet in a flurry of tiny limbs and wild laughter, the linen tangling around her like a defeated ghost. She grabs at Juan's hands, trying to push them away even as she squirms closer for more.

"No! No no no!" she protests, but she's laughing too hard for it to be convincing.

Juan relents for a moment, and she catches her breath—then immediately pulls the sheet back over her head and goes still again. The trap reset. The invitation unmistakable.

Isabel laughs—that real laugh, the one Juan heard yesterday for the first time in months. She reaches over and rests her hand on Juan's arm, watching.

"She'll do this for an hour if you let her," she says. "The same game, over and over. Doña Beatriz says it's maddening. I think it's..." She pauses, searching for the word. "I think it's wonderful. That she can find such joy in something so simple."

The bundle under the sheet giggles preemptively, anticipating the attack.

From somewhere deep in the Alcázar, a bell rings—the call to morning Mass. The palace continues its routines, indifferent to the small drama playing out in the royal bedchamber.

But for now, in this room, there is only this: a husband, a wife, a daughter, and a game that could go on forever.

I gather Catalina up in the linen blanket and hustle her around while I walk through the room. Using the blanket as some sort of cloud she can fly around in. 

I tell Isabel that I plan to name my flagship the "Princess Catalina".

26 nov 2025

Contextualized tender family moment and prepared emotional response



Catalina squeals with delight as Juan gathers her into the linen, transforming the sheet into a billowing cloud. He lifts her high and carries her through the room in great sweeping arcs—around the bedpost, past the dressing table, toward the window where morning light pours in. She clutches the fabric with both hands, eyes wide, mouth open in perpetual astonishment at this new form of flight.

"Wheeee!" she attempts, or something like it.

"The Princess Catalina," Juan says, glancing back at Isabel as he banks his daughter around a chair. "For the flagship. I think it suits her."

Isabel sits up straighter against the headboard, her hand moving unconsciously to her belly. For a moment she says nothing, watching her husband swing their daughter through imaginary skies.

"You would name the ship that carries you to Constantinople after her?" Her voice is soft, not quite steady. "The ship that takes you away from us?"

But there's no reproach in it. She understands what he means—what he's really saying. That he carries them with him. That when he sails east to face whatever awaits, his daughter's name will be carved into the prow, riding the waves before him.

"The Princess Catalina," Isabel repeats, testing the sound of it. A small smile breaks through. "She'll be insufferable when she's old enough to understand, you know. A warship named after her before her second birthday."

Catalina, oblivious to her impending naval immortality, attempts to eat the blanket.

I spend the rest of the coming days with Isabel and Catalina as I wait for the invited guests to arrive.

Lets roll for how Isabel is doing and how the pregnancy is progressing. Be historic and realistic. You have already generated that the baby has not turned yet. Ignore this, we will roll for how the pregnancy goes based purely on a roll. We roll for what happens until the moment the delivery starts.

26 nov 2025

Constructed historically-grounded pregnancy progression table with weighted outcomes












Now let me create a historically realistic roll for Isabel's pregnancy progression leading up to delivery.

PREGNANCY PROGRESSION ROLL
Context: Isabel is approximately seven months pregnant (conceived December 1432/January 1433). She is 17 years old, and this is her second pregnancy. Her first birth (Catalina, January 1432) was a traumatic breech delivery with massive blood loss and severe infection that nearly killed her. Physicians have warned that future pregnancies carry elevated risk.

Historical Factors:

Positive:

Young and otherwise healthy
Best medical care available for the era (Portuguese physicians, experienced midwives)
Second pregnancies often progress more easily than first
Adequate nutrition and rest as queen
Emotional support from husband's presence
Negative:

Previous traumatic birth caused internal damage
Physicians already classified pregnancy as "very risky"
Medieval medicine cannot address many complications
Maternal mortality for complicated cases significantly elevated
ISABEL'S PREGNANCY PROGRESSION (d100 - Chaos Roll)

Roll	Outcome
1-10	Severe Complications — Serious problems develop requiring bed rest; bleeding, severe swelling, or other alarming symptoms; physicians deeply concerned
11-25	Concerning Signs — Baby not positioned well; Isabel experiencing significant discomfort; physicians worried but hopeful
26-45	Difficult but Manageable — Some worrying indicators but nothing critical; Isabel struggling with fatigue and pain; close monitoring required
46-65	Normal Progression — Typical late-pregnancy discomforts; baby's position uncertain but not alarming; physicians cautiously optimistic
66-80	Good Progression — Baby positioned correctly; Isabel handling pregnancy well despite previous trauma; physicians relieved
81-95	Excellent Progression — Strong health, baby positioned perfectly; Isabel's body has healed better than expected from previous birth
96-100	Exceptional — Physicians genuinely surprised; everything progressing better than anyone dared hope
Please roll d100 for Isabel's pregnancy progression.

Unbelievable! I rolled 100! Unbelievable!

Orchestrated narrative arc celebrating exceptional pregnancy progression outcome




PREGNANCY PROGRESSION: EXCEPTIONAL (Roll: 100)
The days that follow Juan's return become something none of them expected: ordinary.

Not the ordinariness of peasants or merchants—there are still servants and guards, still the weight of a kingdom waiting beyond the chamber doors—but the ordinariness of a family. Breakfast with Catalina. Walks in the palace gardens during the cooler morning hours. Isabel resting in the afternoon heat while Juan reviews correspondence or plays with his daughter in the nursery.

And slowly, remarkably, the fear begins to lift.

The First Week (June 23-29)

The Portuguese physicians—the same men who saved Isabel's life eighteen months ago—arrive from Lisbon with Queen Leonor's blessing. They examine Isabel thoroughly, their faces grave with professional concern.

Then something unexpected happens.

"The baby has turned," Dr. Gonçalo announces, unable to entirely hide his surprise. "Head down, properly positioned. This is... this is not what we expected, Your Majesty."

Isabel stares at him. "But you said—the warnings—"

"I know what we said." The elderly physician shakes his head slowly. "The signs were concerning. The baby's position three weeks ago suggested another difficult presentation. But bodies are not machines. Sometimes they surprise us."

His colleague, Dr. Álvares, adds more cautiously: "We must still be vigilant. The Queen's previous birth caused damage that increases risk regardless of the baby's position. But this—" he gestures vaguely, "—this is considerably better than we feared."

The Second Week (June 30 - July 6)

The improvement continues.

Isabel's swelling—which had worried the physicians—subsides. Her color improves. The exhaustion that had plagued her for months gives way to something approaching normal energy for late pregnancy. She begins taking short walks again, leaning on Juan's arm, Catalina toddling alongside them with Doña Beatriz in pursuit.

"I don't understand it," Isabel confesses one evening, her hand resting on her belly. "I was so certain something was wrong. I could feel it. And now..."

She looks at Juan with something like wonder.

"Do you think—" she hesitates. "Do you think God heard us? All those prayers?"

The Third Week (July 7-13)

The Military Order Masters arrive—Santiago, Calatrava, and Alcántara—and Juan must turn his attention to matters of state. But he keeps his promise: he remains in Toledo, conducts all meetings in the Alcázar, and returns to Isabel and Catalina each evening.

Dr. Gonçalo requests a private audience with Juan.

"Your Majesty, I have practiced medicine for thirty-four years. I attended the Queen's first birth. I saw what it did to her body." The old man's voice is careful, precise. "What I am seeing now... I cannot explain it medically. Her recovery from the previous birth appears more complete than we assessed. The baby's position is ideal. Her health is genuinely good—not merely adequate, but good."

He pauses.

"I am not a priest, Your Majesty. I do not speak of miracles. But I will say this: I came to Toledo expecting to fight for two lives. Now I am cautiously optimistic that I will not need to fight at all."

The Fourth Week (July 14-20)

Isabel laughs more now. Real laughter, the kind Juan remembers from before Catalina's birth, before the fear took root.

She plays with Catalina in the mornings, though she tires more quickly as the pregnancy advances. She attends Mass daily, her prayers no longer desperate pleas but something gentler—gratitude mixed with hope.

"I was so afraid," she tells Juan one night, lying beside him in the darkness. "For months, I was certain I was going to die. I could feel it waiting for me, like a shadow. And now..."

She takes his hand and places it on her belly. The baby kicks—strong, insistent.

"Now I think I might live. I think we might all live."

Late July, 1433

The physicians estimate the delivery will come in the first weeks of August. They have prepared everything: the birthing chamber, the midwives, the herbs and instruments. But there is a different quality to their preparations now—efficiency rather than dread.

Queen Leonor arrives from Portugal, bringing additional physicians and her own calm presence. She embraces her daughter, then stands back to look at her.

"You look well," she says, and there is wonder in her voice. "Isabel, you look well."

"I feel well, Mama." Isabel's smile is radiant. "For the first time in months, I feel well."

Current Status (Late July 1433):

Isabel's pregnancy has progressed exceptionally
Baby positioned correctly (head down)
Isabel's health genuinely good—beyond all expectations
Physicians cautiously optimistic rather than grimly prepared
Queen Leonor present for the birth
Delivery expected early August
Juan has kept his promise—he has not left Toledo
The delivery itself awaits. But for now, against all expectations, hope has replaced fear.

What would you like to do before the birth begins?

Lets go back in time and play out the meeting with the masters of the military orders. 

When they arrive, I individually show them the papal decree stating that the orders are now under crown command, now that their function has been completed. 

Then, when they have all three settled in, I summon them together with Alvaro to doscuss what to do next.

Analyzed master personalities and strategized individual then collective meetings












THE MASTERS ARRIVE
Early July 1433
The riders arrived two days before their masters—outriders bearing the banners of three Orders that had fought for Christendom in Iberia for three centuries. Black crosses of Santiago. Red crosses of Calatrava. Green crosses of Alcántara.

By the third of July, all three Masters had reached Toledo.

THE INDIVIDUAL AUDIENCES
Don Luis de Guzmán, Master of Santiago
July 3, 1433 — Late Morning

The Master of Santiago arrived first, as befitted the largest and wealthiest of the Orders. Don Luis de Guzmán rode through Toledo's gates with a modest escort of twelve knights—deliberately understated for a man who commanded 83 commanderies and 2,000 fighting men.

He had aged visibly since the crusade began. The campaigns along the western coast had carved new lines into his face, and gray now dominated his beard. But his bearing remained that of a soldier at ease with authority.

Juan received him privately in the small audience chamber adjacent to the royal study. No scribes. No witnesses save Captain Robles at the door.

Don Luis knelt formally, then rose at Juan's gesture. His eyes were watchful but not hostile—the gaze of a man who had learned to read kings during thirty years of Order politics.

"Your Majesty. I came as quickly as the summons allowed." A pause. "Your letter mentioned matters of great consequence for the Orders."

Juan produced the papal decree—the heavy parchment bearing the Fisherman's Ring and twenty-three cardinal signatures. He handed it to the Master without preamble.

Don Luis read in silence. His expression shifted subtly as he progressed through the articles—recognition, then careful blankness, then something harder to identify. When he reached Article Two, he stopped and read it again. And again.

"...perpetual and permanent control over the Military Orders of Santiago, Calatrava, and Alcántara... The Masters of these Orders shall be appointed by the Crown of Castile..."

A long exhale. Don Luis set the document on the table between them with exaggerated care, as if it might shatter.

"I see." His voice was neutral—professionally so. "And has Your Majesty already determined who shall be appointed as Master of Santiago?"

Don Pedro González de Padilla, Master of Calatrava
July 3, 1433 — Afternoon

The Master of Calatrava was a different man entirely. Where Don Luis cultivated inscrutability, Don Pedro wore his heart closer to the surface. He had wept openly at Juan's speech before Íllora. He had embraced Juan after Loja fell.

Now he sat in the same chair Don Luis had occupied hours before, reading the same decree. His weathered hands trembled slightly as he held the parchment.

"Perpetual," he said finally. "Irrevocable. No pope may revoke." He looked up. "Your Majesty, I have served Calatrava for twenty-three years. I became a knight when I was seventeen. The Order is..."

He stopped, struggling for words.

"The Order was my purpose. To fight the Moor. To defend Christendom's frontier." His voice cracked slightly. "And now the frontier is gone. Granada is Christian. The Reconquista is complete. What is Calatrava for now?"

It was not accusation. It was genuine bewilderment—a soldier confronting the end of the war that had defined his entire life.

"I followed you into Granada because I believed in the crusade. I believe still. But this—" he gestured at the decree, "—this is not just about who appoints whom. This is about what we are."

Don Juan de Sotomayor, Master of Alcántara
July 3, 1433 — Evening

The youngest of the three Masters—though "young" was relative; he had commanded Alcántara for eight years—Don Juan de Sotomayor received the news with the controlled stillness of a man who had learned to survive by revealing nothing prematurely.

He read the decree twice, asked to examine the seals, studied the cardinal signatures. When he finally spoke, his voice was measured.

"The Pope has granted this freely? There was no... coercion? No threat to the Holy Father?"

He seemed to accept Juan's answer, though his eyes remained calculating.

"Alcántara is the smallest of the three Orders," he said. "We hold perhaps fifty commanderies, mostly in northern Extremadura. Our knights number fewer than Calatrava, far fewer than Santiago." A careful pause. "What happens to us now matters less to the realm than what happens to my brothers' Orders. But it matters greatly to me and to my knights."

"What assurances can Your Majesty offer that Alcántara will not simply be... absorbed? Dissolved? Our lands distributed to reward loyal nobles?"

THE JOINT MEETING
July 4, 1433 — Morning Royal Council Chamber, Alcázar of Toledo

The three Masters sat on one side of the long table. Álvaro de Luna sat at Juan's right hand, his dark eyes moving between the Masters with the patient attention of a man who had spent decades navigating exactly these kinds of tensions.

The mood was not hostile, but neither was it comfortable. These were proud men—men who had commanded armies, administered vast territories, answered to no king for centuries. The papal decree was legitimate; they did not dispute it. But legitimacy and acceptance were not the same thing.

Don Luis de Guzmán spoke first, his voice carrying the weight of the senior Master present.

"Your Majesty. We have each read the Pope's decree. We acknowledge its authority. The Holy Father has spoken, and we are faithful sons of the Church." He paused. "But we have questions. Concerns. We would hear from Your Majesty's own lips what you intend for our Orders."

Don Pedro nodded, his earlier emotion now contained but still visible beneath the surface. "What are we for now? The Moor is defeated. The frontier is gone."

Don Juan de Sotomayor leaned forward slightly. "And what happens to our knights? Our commanderies? Our traditions?"

Álvaro remained silent, watching Juan. This was the King's moment—the Constable would not speak unless called upon.

The three Masters waited.

Thank you all for coming. We have won a great victory and now is the time to set our sights on new glories. The orders were founded to drive the moors from Iberia. Now that this has been achieved, we must find a new purpose and make sure the military orders are in a good position to fulfill that purpose. The Moors are no more. The border forts in our kingdom may not be needed anymore. But this does not diminish the need for the orders at all. In fact, if christianity calls again, I might need the orders more than ever before. 

The pope has granted me full authority over the orders, meaning that the men in this room can determine together how best to reshape the orders while preserving their traditions and identity. You all have served me and the crusade greatly so I seek no change in leadership. 

In regards to what out next goals are: I see two major objectives. The first is eternal crusade against Morocco. I have already sent out informants to Morocco to look and see what cities are ripe for conquest. I see no problems in taking cities, but holding them is where the orders come in. Secondly, I will leave for constantinople next spring to see if we can drive the Ottomans from europe in the east as well. I have promised the Greeks 1000 knights from the orders to temporarily support the Greeks. Depending on what the actual situation is, we might commit to also fight in the east against the Ottomans. This will require the sustained campain, forts and commanderies the orders specialize in. 

Either way, we should make use of our new developed tactics and I hope the orders will send their officers to the War academy to learn these new tactics that are needed to fight the ottomans and the Moroccans. 

In short, we must reform the orders so they can best face the new challenges. Challenges that are different from fighting Grenada so that naturally requires some different organization. But I have every intention to again let the orders take a pivotal role in our new campains. Castille and it's success and glory is because of the military orders who have contributed greatly to the reconquista and I will never forget that.

Analyzed diplomatic approach and mapped realistic NPC reactions
















Let me analyze this using the NPC guide principles before creating the table.

ANALYSIS: MASTERS' REACTION TO JUAN'S SPEECH
What Juan Is Offering:
Positives for the Masters:

No change in current leadership — they keep their positions (HUGE relief)
Clear new missions providing purpose (Morocco, Constantinople)
Recognition of their service and contributions
Promise of continued pivotal role
Preservation of traditions and identity (stated intent)
Specificity about future campaigns — not vague promises
Concerns They Would Have:

The decision is fait accompli — they're being informed, not consulted
The 1,000 knights were already committed to Constantinople WITHOUT their input
"Reform" is vague — what does this actually mean for their structures?
War Academy requirement implies their current methods are inadequate
Morocco and Constantinople are overseas — far from Order territories, unfamiliar warfare
Crown control is permanent and irrevocable — their autonomy is gone forever
Identity/Psychology Assessment:
Don Luis de Guzmán (Santiago):

Most political of the three, best able to calculate long-term implications
Santiago is largest, most powerful — has most to lose from crown control
BUT also most able to see that resistance is futile and cooperation is best path
Keeping his position matters enormously
Don Pedro González de Padilla (Calatrava):

Emotionally invested, confused about purpose
Juan's clear new mission might actually resonate with him deeply
He WANTS purpose — Juan is offering it
Most likely to respond emotionally to the vision
Don Juan de Sotomayor (Alcántara):

Most cautious, worried about survival of smallest Order
Calculating whether cooperation or resistance better serves Alcántara
Needs specific assurances about not being absorbed
Juan didn't address his specific concern directly
Approach Quality Assessment:
Strengths:

Respectful tone
Acknowledges their service meaningfully
Clear vision for future
Leadership continuity (critical)
Connects new mission to Order traditions
Weaknesses:

"Reform" remains vague — they don't know what this means practically
Already committed 1,000 knights without consultation (reveals where real power lies)
War Academy comment could be read as criticism
Didn't specifically address Alcántara's survival concerns
No specifics on how Order wealth/commanderies will be handled
Overall: A solid, respectful approach that addresses their core fear (losing positions) while providing purpose. But lacks specifics on the "reform" that would reassure them about what's actually changing. The prior commitment of 1,000 knights without consultation subtly demonstrates that crown authority is already operational.

1-10	Formal Compliance, Deep Resistance — Masters accept the decree's legitimacy but their body language and careful words reveal profound unease. Don Luis raises pointed questions about what "reform" means that border on challenge. Don Juan de Sotomayor openly asks for written guarantees against dissolution. Don Pedro withdraws into silence. They will cooperate minimally while quietly working to limit crown authority in practice. Extensive negotiations needed before any real cooperation.
11-25	Cautious Acceptance, Significant Concerns — Masters acknowledge the new reality but press hard for specifics. Don Luis wants detailed written protections for Order properties and revenues. Don Juan de Sotomayor demands explicit guarantees about Alcántara's continued existence. Don Pedro asks difficult questions about the War Academy—are their current knights inadequate? The 1,000-knight commitment made without consultation is raised as a concern. Productive meeting, but trust must be built gradually.
26-40	Guarded Cooperation — Masters accept Juan's vision but remain watchful. They appreciate the leadership continuity and the clear mission, but want more specifics on "reform" before fully committing. Don Luis speaks for all three when he requests a follow-up meeting to discuss practical details. The tone is professional rather than warm. They will cooperate, but will also protect their Orders' interests carefully.
41-60	Constructive Engagement — Masters are genuinely receptive to Juan's vision. Don Pedro, in particular, responds to the clarity of purpose Juan provides. Don Luis acknowledges that crown authority, properly exercised, could actually strengthen the Orders for their new mission. Don Juan de Sotomayor relaxes visibly when Juan emphasizes preserving traditions and identity. They raise practical questions (logistics, timelines, specifics of reform) but from a cooperative posture. Real dialogue begins.
61-75	Positive Reception — The Masters respond well to Juan's approach. Don Pedro is visibly moved by the vision of continued crusading purpose. Don Luis offers concrete suggestions for how the Orders might adapt. Don Juan de Sotomayor proposes that Alcántara could specialize in particular aspects of the new missions. The conversation shifts from "what are you doing to us" to "how can we make this work." Álvaro exchanges a satisfied glance with Juan.
76-90	Enthusiastic Cooperation — Juan's speech strikes exactly the right notes. Don Pedro declares that this gives Calatrava the purpose it has been seeking since Granada fell. Don Luis, the most cautious, acknowledges that Juan has handled a difficult transition with unusual grace. Don Juan de Sotomayor volunteers Alcántara knights for the War Academy program. The Masters begin discussing practical implementation among themselves, treating Juan as partner rather than new overlord.
91-100	Wholehearted Embrace — The Masters are genuinely inspired. Don Pedro weeps again—not from confusion this time, but from relief and renewed purpose. Don Luis sets aside political calculation and speaks from the heart about what it means to have a king who understands the Orders' value. Don Juan de Sotomayor pledges Alcántara's full commitment to whatever role Juan assigns. The meeting transforms from negotiation into planning session, with all three Masters actively competing to contribute ideas for the new crusading mission. A genuine partnership is forged.
Baseline Assessment: Given Juan's solid but not perfect approach, the natural center of this table is around 41-60 (Constructive Engagement). Juan addressed their biggest fear (losing positions) and provided clear purpose, but left "reform" vague and revealed through the prior knight commitment that he's already exercising authority without consultation.

Orchestrated cautious diplomatic response with layered concerns




CAUTIOUS ACCEPTANCE, SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS (Roll: 15)
The silence that follows Juan's speech stretches longer than comfort allows.

Don Luis de Guzmán is the first to move—a slight shift in his chair, his fingers steepling before him in the manner of a man organizing his thoughts. His face remains carefully neutral, but his eyes have sharpened.

"Your Majesty speaks of reform," he says, his voice measured. "Of reshaping the Orders while preserving traditions and identity. These are fine words. But words are not policy."

He glances at his fellow Masters, then continues.

"Santiago commands eighty-three commanderies. Vast lands in Extremadura, Murcia, Andalucía. Revenues that fund two thousand knights and their households. When Your Majesty speaks of reform—" he lets the word hang, "—what precisely does this mean for our properties? Our revenues? The rights we have held for three centuries?"

Don Pedro González de Padilla stirs, his earlier emotional vulnerability now hardened into something more defensive. "Your Majesty mentioned the War Academy. That our officers should learn 'new tactics needed to fight the Ottomans and Moroccans.'"

He pauses, and when he speaks again, there is an edge beneath the respect.

"Calatrava has fought the Moor for two hundred and seventy years. My knights broke the Granadan cavalry at Alcalá. We held the siege lines at Málaga through three weeks of sorties. We bled for the crusade Your Majesty led to victory." His jaw tightens. "Are we now to be told our methods are... inadequate? That we must sit as students while others teach us war?"

Don Juan de Sotomayor has been silent, watching, calculating. Now he leans forward.

"Your Majesty said you seek no change in leadership. That you intend to preserve our traditions and identity." His voice is quiet but precise. "Yet I notice Your Majesty did not address my specific concern from yesterday. Alcántara is the smallest of the three Orders. We hold fifty commanderies. Fewer knights than my brothers command."

He spreads his hands on the table.

"When resources are scarce and priorities must be set, the smallest is always first to be... rationalized. Absorbed. Dissolved for the greater good." His eyes meet Juan's directly. "I would have written guarantees, Your Majesty. Explicit commitments that Alcántara will not simply disappear into Santiago or Calatrava when administrative convenience suggests it."

Don Luis nods slowly, then raises another point—the one Juan perhaps hoped would pass unremarked.

"Your Majesty mentioned one thousand knights already committed to Constantinople. Committed to the Greeks." His tone remains respectful, but barely. "This commitment was made, I understand, while Your Majesty was at Basel. Before this meeting. Before any consultation with the Orders whose knights are being committed."

He lets that sit for a moment.

"We do not dispute the Pope's decree. The Holy Father has spoken. Crown authority over the Orders is now... reality." The word comes out carefully. "But if this authority is to be exercised wisely—if the Orders are to serve Castile as effectively as Your Majesty desires—then perhaps future commitments might benefit from... consultation. Before they are made."

Álvaro de Luna remains silent at Juan's side, his face unreadable. This is the King's negotiation to conduct.

The three Masters wait. They have accepted the new order—but they are making clear that acceptance is not the same as surrender, and cooperation must be earned, not assumed.

You knights are not inferior. I am only inviting them to make use of the most modern tactics if we are to fight the Ottomans. I did not order you to do so, but please make use of the academy. 

As for the 1000 soldiers, I promised as Castille that we would support them with that amount. I specifically have asked you to come here so we way discuss together how to achieve this. Understand that I could not say to the Greeks: "Let me first discuss with the masters of my order if and how we can send any help." I gave the Greeks my word as king. If the orders cannot fulfill this request, then I will send my own men. I will keep my word. But understand that I had to balance committing to aid to the Greeks and discussing the operation with you, which we are doing now. 

You ask what reform looks like. We should first make sure we understand what your new purpose is exactly. Only then can we determine in what way the orders should be reformed. So I can't tell you exactly what this would look like now. We must first focus on the purpose first. Until then, things will stay the same. 

I have no problem drafting a new order charter stating that the honourable order of Alcantara will maintain it's identity and will not be absorbed into another order.

Analyzed diplomatic responses and predicted nuanced reactions from each master








The atmosphere in the chamber shifts—subtly, but perceptibly.

Don Juan de Sotomayor sits back in his chair, and something in his posture eases. The offer of a written charter—specific, concrete, addressing his exact concern—has landed precisely where it needed to.

"A charter," he repeats, almost to himself. Then, more formally: "Your Majesty, that is... that is what I asked for. If Alcántara's identity and continued existence can be guaranteed in writing, then Alcántara will serve the crown faithfully in whatever capacity is required."

He inclines his head—not deeply, but genuinely. One concern addressed. One Master, if not won, at least reassured.

Don Pedro's defensiveness has softened as well. The clarification about the War Academy—invitation, not order—has salved the wound to professional pride.

"An invitation," he says slowly. "Then I... may have spoken too sharply, Your Majesty. Calatrava has always sought to improve. If new tactics exist that will help us fight the enemies of Christ more effectively..." He trails off, then nods. "I will send officers to observe. To learn what may be useful."

It is not enthusiastic embrace. But it is cooperation.

Don Luis de Guzmán remains the most guarded. He has listened to Juan's explanations with the attention of a man parsing a contract for hidden clauses.

"Your Majesty's position regarding Constantinople is... understandable," he allows. "A king must be able to make commitments. And you are correct—we are discussing the operation now, which is consultation of a sort."

Of a sort. The qualifier hangs in the air.

"But I would note, for future reference, that the Orders' value lies not merely in our knights' swords but in our knowledge. Our experience. Our understanding of logistics, of garrison warfare, of holding territory far from home." His eyes meet Juan's steadily. "If Castile is to campaign in Morocco, in Constantinople, in lands none of us have seen—that experience may prove valuable. Before commitments are made. Not merely after."

He is not challenging Juan's authority. He is making a case for his own relevance—positioning Santiago as an asset to be consulted, not merely a resource to be deployed.

Then he shifts, moving toward substance.

"Your Majesty says we must first understand our new purpose before we can discuss reform. This is logical." He glances at his fellow Masters. "So let us discuss purpose. You have mentioned two objectives: Morocco and Constantinople. These are very different campaigns. Different terrain. Different enemies. Different distances from Castile."

Don Pedro nods, his soldier's mind engaging now that bruised pride has been set aside. "Morocco is across the strait. Close. Reinforcement and supply are possible. Constantinople is..." He shakes his head. "Months away by sea. Fighting there means fighting far from home, far from support."

Don Juan de Sotomayor adds quietly: "And the Ottomans are not the Moors of Granada. Everything we hear suggests they are more numerous, better organized, better equipped. The Greeks have been losing to them for decades."

Álvaro de Luna speaks for the first time, his voice mild. "These are precisely the questions His Majesty hoped to discuss with you. What would be required? What is realistic? What role can the Orders play—and what role should they play?"

The three Masters exchange glances. The conversation has shifted from confrontation to consultation.

Don Luis turns back to Juan.

"Very well, Your Majesty. Let us discuss purpose. You have our attention—and, provisionally, our cooperation." A pause, weighted with meaning. "What would you have us consider?"

Keep in mind, our goal in Constantinople is not to defeat them. We must learn about the situation. If Constantinople can even be saved in the first place. And your king has promised immediate aid to save them from immediate danger. That aid is 60.000 florins, paid by the crown and 1000 knights to temporarily reinforce the city. 

Master Juan de Sotomayor, how would you go about this situation? What would you propose?

Analyzed NPC psychology and crafted contextual reaction table








Let me analyze this using NPC guide principles.

ANALYSIS: DON JUAN DE SOTOMAYOR'S REACTION
Context:
Juan has just given Sotomayor exactly what he asked for—a written charter guaranteeing Alcántara's continued existence. Now Juan is singling him out for advice, asking him specifically rather than the senior Masters. This is significant.

Psychology Assessment:
Positive Factors:

His core concern (Alcántara's survival) has been addressed
Being asked directly is a status boost—especially in front of larger Orders' Masters
Opportunity to demonstrate Alcántara's value beyond mere numbers
Chance to position himself as trusted advisor, not just subordinate
Juan's clarification (assess situation, not conquer Ottoman Empire) makes the question answerable
Complicating Factors:

He has NO direct experience with Ottomans, Constantinople, or Eastern Mediterranean
His expertise is Iberian frontier warfare against Moors
Overreaching his knowledge would be embarrassing in front of peers
Underperforming would waste the opportunity Juan has given him
What He Actually Knows:

Garrison warfare and holding territory
Managing knights far from central authority
Logistics of sustained military operations
The challenges of operating in hostile territory
Practical military assessment (what can be held, what cannot)
What He Doesn't Know:

Ottoman military capabilities (beyond rumors)
Constantinople's defenses or geography
Greek reliability as allies
Naval logistics in Eastern Mediterranean
Local political dynamics
Realistic Response Range:
A competent military man in this position would likely:

Acknowledge limits of his direct knowledge
Offer principles from his actual experience that might apply
Ask clarifying questions to understand the situation better
Be cautious about firm recommendations on unfamiliar ground
Try to demonstrate value without overreaching
D100 TABLE: SOTOMAYOR'S RESPONSE
Roll	Outcome
1-10	Defensive Deflection — Sotomayor freezes, uncomfortable at being singled out. He deflects to the senior Masters: "Perhaps Don Luis, with Santiago's greater resources, would be better positioned to advise..." This wastes the opportunity Juan offered and makes him appear weak before his peers. Don Luis's expression flickers with something like contempt. The dynamic shifts unfavorably.
11-20	Cautious Non-Answer — Sotomayor hedges extensively. "Your Majesty, I know little of Constantinople or the Turk. Alcántara has fought the Moor, not the Ottoman." He offers no insights, no questions, no engagement with the problem. Technically honest, but unhelpful. Juan's gesture of respect goes unrewarded. The consultation stalls.
21-35	Honest Limitation, Minimal Contribution — Sotomayor acknowledges his inexperience but offers only generic observations: supply lines matter, garrison morale is important, unfamiliar terrain is dangerous. Nothing wrong, but nothing particularly useful. The other Masters are not impressed. Juan may need to draw him out further or turn to others.
36-50	Cautious but Constructive — Sotomayor admits his limits but engages seriously. He asks practical questions: How will knights reach Constantinople? How long must they hold? What support can Greeks actually provide? He frames his contribution as "questions a garrison commander would ask" rather than pretending expertise he lacks. Useful, if modest.
51-65	Practical Military Thinking — Sotomayor draws on his actual expertise. "Your Majesty, I have held frontier posts far from reinforcement. The question is not how many knights you send, but what they can realistically accomplish." He raises logistics, rotation, exit strategy. He asks penetrating questions about Greek reliability. Demonstrates solid military judgment within his experience.
66-80	Valuable Contribution — Sotomayor surprises the room with thoughtful analysis. He distinguishes between "reinforcing a city that can hold" versus "sending men into a lost cause." He proposes that the first knights sent should include experienced assessors who can report honestly on Constantinople's actual defensibility. "Before we commit more, we must know what we're committing to." Don Luis nods approvingly.
81-90	Impressive Insight — Sotomayor demonstrates unexpected strategic depth. He outlines a phased approach: initial reconnaissance force, honest assessment, then calibrated commitment. He raises the question of what happens to Order knights if Constantinople falls—extraction planning. He notes that Alcántara's smaller size might actually suit an initial assessment mission. "We are accustomed to operating with fewer resources. That teaches careful judgment." The other Masters look at him with new respect.
91-100	Exceptional Performance — Sotomayor seizes the opportunity brilliantly. He provides a coherent framework: immediate aid as promised (honor demands it), built-in assessment mechanism, clear criteria for escalation or withdrawal, rotation system to prevent knights being trapped indefinitely. He addresses both military and political dimensions. When finished, even Don Luis acknowledges: "The Master of Alcántara speaks wisdom." Juan's decision to consult him specifically is validated. Sotomayor has established himself as a valuable voice in future councils.
Baseline Assessment: Juan's approach is excellent—he's given Sotomayor what he wanted and is now offering him status and relevance. But Sotomayor is being asked about something outside his direct experience. The table centers around 36-50 (Cautious but Constructive) as the natural baseline—a competent professional engaging honestly with his limitations while trying to contribute what he can.

Recalibrated roll outcome and orchestrated exceptional narrative scene



EXCEPTIONAL PERFORMANCE (Roll: 91)
Don Juan de Sotomayor is silent for a long moment after Juan's question. The other Masters watch him—Don Luis with polite skepticism, Don Pedro with neutral curiosity. The smallest Order. The youngest Master. Asked to advise the King on a campaign none of them have ever contemplated.

Then something shifts in Sotomayor's bearing. He sits straighter. When he speaks, his voice carries a clarity that was not there before.

"Your Majesty honors me by asking." No false humility, no deflection. He accepts the question as his to answer.

"I know little of Constantinople. I have never seen the Bosphorus or faced Ottoman sipahis. But I know something of holding ground far from home with fewer men than the task demands. That is what Alcántara has done for two centuries."

He rises from his chair—not asking permission, simply needing to move as his mind works. The other Masters exchange glances but say nothing.

"Your Majesty has promised immediate aid. One thousand knights, sixty thousand florins. This promise must be kept—honor demands it, and Castile's word must mean something if we are to be taken seriously in the East." He turns to face Juan directly. "But how we keep that promise matters as much as that we keep it."

He begins to pace, hands clasped behind his back.

"I would propose a phased approach. Three stages."

"First: The Vanguard."

"Send three hundred knights immediately. Not the full thousand—not yet. These three hundred should include your best captains, men capable of honest assessment. Their task is twofold: reinforce the walls, yes, but also see. See the defenses. See the Greek troops. See whether Constantinople can truly be held or whether we are pouring water into sand."

He pauses.

"Include men who will tell you the truth even if the truth is ugly. Not courtiers seeking glory. Soldiers who understand that an honest report of failure is worth more than a flattering report of false hope."

"Second: The Assessment."

"Give these three hundred knights ninety days. At the end of ninety days, they send a report—not to the Greeks, not to the Pope, but to you, Your Majesty. This report answers three questions."

He holds up three fingers.

"One: Can Constantinople hold for five years with the forces available, including our support? Two: What would be required to make it hold for twenty years? Three: If it cannot hold—if the situation is truly desperate—how do we extract our knights before the walls fall?"

Don Luis stirs at this. "You speak of... retreat? Before we have even arrived?"

Sotomayor turns to the older Master without flinching. "I speak of reality, Don Luis. Alcántara has held posts that could not be held. I have buried knights who died not because they failed, but because no one planned for what to do when success became impossible. I will not send Alcántara brothers to die in a city that is already lost without at least considering how to bring them home."

A long pause. Don Luis inclines his head slightly—not agreement, perhaps, but acknowledgment.

"Third: Calibrated Commitment."

Sotomayor continues, his momentum building.

"Based on the assessment, Your Majesty decides. If Constantinople can hold—if our knights can make a difference—then send the remaining seven hundred. Rotate them on twelve-month deployments so no man is trapped indefinitely. Establish supply through Venetian or Genoese merchants; we cannot rely on Greek logistics alone."

He stops pacing and faces Juan.

"But if the assessment says Constantinople is lost—if the Ottomans will take it regardless of what we do—then Your Majesty must decide whether to die gloriously for a doomed city or preserve Castilian strength for battles we can actually win."

He lets that sit for a moment.

"Morocco, for instance. Close to home. Achievable. Sustainable. A victory there builds strength for future campaigns. A catastrophe at Constantinople might break us for a generation."

Don Pedro González de Padilla speaks into the silence that follows. "You have thought about this."

"I have thought about holding impossible positions," Sotomayor replies quietly. "Constantinople is the most impossible position in Christendom. That does not mean we should abandon it. It means we should approach it with open eyes."

Don Luis de Guzmán studies the younger Master with an expression that has shifted from skepticism to something approaching respect.

"The Master of Alcántara speaks wisdom," he says finally. The words come slowly, as if drawn out against his natural inclination. "A phased approach. Assessment before full commitment. Extraction planning." He glances at Juan. "These are not the words of a man seeking glory. They are the words of a man who has learned that glory without survival is merely a pretty death."

Álvaro de Luna permits himself a small smile. He catches Juan's eye briefly.

Sotomayor returns to his seat, his piece said. But he sits differently now—no longer the junior Master hoping not to be absorbed, but a counselor who has proven his worth.

The dynamic in the room has shifted.

You make a fine point. And how should these 300 be assembled? From all three orders? Or would you include some crown soldiers as well? And who do you propose will lead this force?

Weighed political dimensions of force composition and leadership selection












ANALYSIS: SOTOMAYOR'S RESPONSE ON COMPOSITION AND LEADERSHIP
Context:
Sotomayor has just delivered an exceptional strategic framework. Now Juan is pressing further—asking him to propose specific force composition and, critically, leadership. This shifts from military analysis to political navigation.

The Challenge:
Force composition is manageable—shared contribution from all three Orders is the obvious diplomatic answer.

Leadership is treacherous:

If he proposes himself → could seem self-aggrandizing, grabbing glory
If he proposes another Master → gives away the opportunity he just created
If he proposes a crown commander → might offend the Orders collectively
If he deflects entirely → wastes the momentum he's built
Psychology:
Sotomayor has just established himself as a serious voice. He's riding high on that success. But he's still the junior Master in the room, and Don Luis de Guzmán is watching carefully. Overreach now could undo the goodwill he's built.

A truly exceptional political operator would find a way to:

Position himself as a candidate without overtly grabbing
Acknowledge the sensitivities openly
Give Juan room to make the decision while making clear he's willing to serve
D100 TABLE: SOTOMAYOR'S POLITICAL NAVIGATION
Roll	Outcome
1-15	Overreach — Success goes to his head. Sotomayor proposes himself as commander too eagerly, framing it as logical extension of his analysis. Don Luis's expression hardens. The room's mood shifts—what seemed like wisdom now looks like self-promotion. Sotomayor has damaged the credibility he just built.
16-30	Retreat into Caution — Having shone brightly, Sotomayor suddenly fears overstepping. He deflects: "Leadership must be Your Majesty's decision. I would not presume..." The momentum dies. Juan is left without the guidance he sought. An opportunity wasted.
31-45	Safe but Unremarkable — Sotomayor handles composition well (shared contribution from all Orders plus crown soldiers) but punts on leadership, suggesting only general criteria: "A man who can assess honestly and command respect." Competent but uninspired. Juan must draw him out further or turn elsewhere.
46-60	Diplomatic but Clear — Sotomayor proposes balanced composition and carefully suggests leadership criteria that happen to describe himself without naming himself. "A commander from the smaller Orders might serve well—accustomed to doing much with little." Don Luis sees through it but cannot object to the logic. The door is opened without Sotomayor walking through it uninvited.
61-75	Graceful Positioning — Sotomayor addresses composition thoughtfully, then handles leadership with political skill. He acknowledges his own interest openly: "I will not pretend I have not considered that Alcántara might serve well in this role. But I am not the only choice, and Your Majesty must weigh factors I cannot see." Honest, humble, but clearly available. The other Masters respect the candor.
76-85	Masterful Navigation — Sotomayor proposes a structure that serves everyone: mixed force from all three Orders plus crown observers, with leadership rotating or shared in ways that give each Order stakes. Then he addresses his own candidacy directly and disarmingly. He makes himself the obvious choice without ever claiming he should be chosen. Don Luis actually nods approval at the political craftsmanship.
86-100	Exceptional Statesmanship — Sotomayor transcends the political trap entirely. He proposes composition, addresses leadership honestly, but then reframes the question in a way that elevates the entire discussion. He demonstrates that his investment is in the mission's success, not personal glory—and in doing so, makes himself the only logical choice while appearing selfless. Even Don Luis is impressed. Juan's decision to consult him is vindicated completely.
Baseline Assessment: Sotomayor is riding momentum from his exceptional military analysis, but political navigation is a different skill. The center of this table is around 46-60—diplomatic handling that positions him without overreaching. His previous success (91) suggests he's performing well today, but that doesn't guarantee continued excellence in a different domain.

Orchestrated political strategy balancing competing interests masterfully




MASTERFUL NAVIGATION (Roll: 78)
Sotomayor does not answer immediately. He takes a breath, and when he speaks, there is a deliberateness to his words that suggests he understands exactly what ground he is walking on.

"Composition first," he says. "That is the easier question."

He looks to each Master in turn as he speaks—including them, not lecturing.

"The vanguard should draw from all three Orders. Not equally—that would be foolish, given our different strengths—but visibly. When these knights ride through Constantinople's gates, the Greeks should see Santiago's black cross, Calatrava's red, Alcántara's green. They should see that Castile's entire crusading tradition stands with them, not merely one Order's ambition."

Don Luis nods slightly. This is politically sound.

"I would propose: one hundred fifty from Santiago, one hundred from Calatrava, fifty from Alcántara." He holds up a hand before anyone can object. "This reflects our relative strength. Santiago has more knights to spare; Alcántara fewer. But all three Orders share the burden and the honor."

Don Pedro speaks: "And crown soldiers?"

"Yes." Sotomayor turns to Juan. "Your Majesty should include fifty men from the crown forces. Soldiers who answer to you directly, not to any Master. They serve two purposes: first, they demonstrate that this is Castile's mission, not merely the Orders' adventure. Second—" he pauses, choosing words carefully, "—they provide Your Majesty with eyes that owe no loyalty except to you. If a Master's report is... colored by pride or ambition, crown soldiers can provide a different perspective."

A slight tension enters the room. Sotomayor has just suggested—politely, diplomatically—that the Orders' reports might not be entirely trustworthy. But he has included himself in that implicit criticism, which disarms it.

Don Luis's eyes narrow, but he does not object. The logic is sound, even if it stings.

"And leadership."

Sotomayor's voice shifts. Slower now. More careful.

"This is the harder question. And I will not pretend I do not have personal interest in the answer."

He looks directly at Don Luis, then Don Pedro, then Juan.

"Alcántara is the smallest Order. We have always had to do more with less. That has taught us... economy. Careful judgment. The habit of asking 'what can we actually achieve' rather than 'what glory can we win.'" A slight smile. "It has also taught us humility, because we cannot afford pride we cannot pay for."

He spreads his hands.

"I believe Alcántara would serve well in leading this vanguard. Not because we are greater than Santiago or Calatrava—we are not—but because the nature of this mission suits our experience. Assessment. Careful judgment. Holding ground with limited resources. Knowing when to fight and when to preserve strength for another day."

He pauses.

"But I am not the only choice. And I am not so foolish as to think I see all factors Your Majesty must weigh."

Now he does something unexpected. He turns to Don Luis de Guzmán.

"Don Luis. Santiago is the greatest of our Orders. If you believe Santiago should lead this vanguard, I will not contest it. I will send Alcántara's fifty knights under your command, and I will support that command loyally." His voice carries no resentment, no false humility—simply honest acknowledgment. "The mission matters more than who leads it."

Don Luis is silent for a long moment. His expression is unreadable.

Then, slowly, the corner of his mouth twitches. Not quite a smile—Don Luis does not smile easily—but something approaching respect.

"The Master of Alcántara plays this game better than I expected," he says dryly. "He makes himself the obvious choice while appearing to defer. He addresses his own ambition openly, which makes it seem like honesty rather than grasping. And he offers to serve under me, knowing I cannot accept such an offer without appearing to have stolen command from a man who clearly deserves it."

He shakes his head slowly.

"Well played, Don Juan. Well played indeed."

Sotomayor inclines his head, accepting the characterization without shame. "I learned politics from watching Santiago, Don Luis. You have been an excellent teacher, even if you did not intend to be."

Something that might be a genuine smile flickers across Don Luis's face. "Apparently so."

Don Pedro laughs—a short, surprised bark. "I thought we were discussing Constantinople. It seems we are also watching a masterwork of positioning."

The tension in the room has transformed. What could have been rivalry or resentment has become something closer to professional admiration. Sotomayor has made his case without alienating his peers—indeed, by being so transparent about his maneuvering, he has turned it into a shared joke rather than a threat.

Don Luis turns to Juan, his expression settling into something more serious.

"Your Majesty asked for counsel. Here is mine: the Master of Alcántara has proposed a sound structure and has demonstrated exactly the kind of careful thinking this mission requires. I will not pretend I would not have welcomed command myself. But Don Juan has made his case well, and—" a pause, as if the words cost him something, "—I believe he may be the right choice for this particular task."

He glances at Don Pedro, who nods.

"Calatrava concurs. If Your Majesty wishes to appoint the Master of Alcántara to lead the vanguard, he will have our support."

All eyes turn to Juan.

I understand that the orders together propose the force to Constantinople will be led by the master of Alcantara, as well as a force make-up as a mix of the three orders and fifty crown soldiers as well. I have already seventeen men in Constantinople right now. Another thirty would complement them nicely. 

I will be sending you on your way with 60.000 florins commmander. will you be able to repair the walls with these funds? And does this fit your goal of assessing if the city can be saved?

26 nov 2025

Weighed practical limitations against mission objectives honestly







Sotomayor absorbs the appointment with a single nod—no effusive gratitude, no false modesty. He has argued for this command; now he must prove worthy of it.

The practical questions focus him immediately. His brow furrows.

"Your Majesty, I will answer honestly: I do not know if sixty thousand florins can repair Constantinople's walls. I have never seen them." He glances at Álvaro, then back to Juan. "What I know of them comes from pilgrim tales and old chronicles. They say the Theodosian walls are the greatest fortifications in Christendom—triple walls, towers every fifty meters, a moat that can be flooded. They have stood for a thousand years."

He pauses, thinking through the implications.

"If those walls are intact and merely need garrison—sixty thousand florins is a fortune. We could supply defenders for years. But if the walls are crumbling, if centuries of neglect have left breaches and weak points..." He shakes his head. "Then sixty thousand florins might patch one section while three others fall. I cannot promise what I do not know."

His voice firms.

"But this is precisely why the assessment matters. The seventeen men Your Majesty already has in Constantinople—who leads them? What have they reported? If I am to command this mission, I must know what they have already learned."

He straightens, visibly shifting into the role of commander rather than counselor.

"With Your Majesty's permission, I would propose this: I will not spend the sixty thousand florins on walls until I have seen Constantinople myself. The money travels with us, secured. When I arrive, I meet with Your Majesty's men already there. I inspect the defenses. I speak with the Greeks—their engineers, their commanders, their Emperor if he will receive me."

He holds up a hand, ticking off points.

"Then I determine: What does Constantinople actually need? Is it walls? Is it men? Is it food, weapons, ships? Perhaps the walls are stronger than we fear and the money is better spent on supplies for a siege. Perhaps one critical section needs immediate repair while the rest can hold. Perhaps—" his voice drops slightly, "—the situation is already beyond what sixty thousand florins can remedy, and we must tell Your Majesty the hard truth."

He meets Juan's eyes directly.

"Sixty thousand florins is a tool, Your Majesty. I will not squander it on assumptions. I will spend it on what Constantinople actually needs—or I will bring it back and tell you that the city cannot be saved regardless of what we spend."

A pause.

"Does this fit your goal of assessment? I believe it is the assessment. The money is not separate from the mission. How we use it—or whether we use it at all—will tell us whether Constantinople can hold."

I will grant you a decree placing you in command of all forces in Constantinople, including those men already there. Indeed, use your initiative to see where the money can best be spent, but know that the Greeks themselves estimate that it will cost 55.000 florins for essential repairs of the walls and I have given them my word that I will gift them these funds to be used on their walls repair. I feel like only in extreme situations should you move not to keep this promise. 

Also, know that I will travel to the city myself in spring 1434, possibly with the other 700 knights.

26 nov 2025

Analyzed command constraints and royal visit implications strategically





Sotomayor listens carefully, and his expression shifts subtly as the full picture becomes clear.

"I understand, Your Majesty. The funds are committed—a promise already given. I will honor that promise unless circumstances make it genuinely impossible to do so." He pauses. "May I ask what would constitute such an extreme situation in Your Majesty's view? If the walls are beyond repair entirely? If the Greeks have already fallen before we arrive? I would know where the boundaries of my discretion lie, so I do not overstep—or understep—when the moment demands decision."

He waits for Juan's answer, then continues, his tone shifting as he addresses the second revelation.

"Your Majesty intends to travel to Constantinople personally."

It is not a question. Sotomayor's face has become carefully neutral—the expression of a man processing information with significant implications.

"In spring of 1434. With the remaining seven hundred knights."

He glances briefly at Don Luis and Don Pedro. Both Masters have stiffened slightly. The King of Castile, traveling to the far end of the Mediterranean, to a city besieged by the greatest military power in the known world.

Sotomayor chooses his next words with evident care.

"Your Majesty, this changes the nature of my mission considerably. I am no longer merely assessing whether Constantinople can be saved. I am preparing the ground for my king's arrival." He lets that sit for a moment. "The stakes of my assessment are no longer simply 'should we commit more knights.' They are 'is it safe for the King of Castile to set foot in this city.'"

His voice firms.

"I will need to send regular reports. Not merely a final assessment after ninety days, but ongoing communication—monthly at minimum, more frequently if circumstances warrant. Your Majesty must know what awaits before you sail, not after you arrive."

He hesitates, then speaks with the directness of a soldier addressing his commander.

"And I must ask, Your Majesty: does the Queen know of this plan? You have an heir who is not yet two years old, and—God willing—another child coming. If Constantinople's walls should fail while you stand upon them..."

He does not finish the sentence. He does not need to.

There is something you should all know about me by now. I do not fear God's calling. I do not fear travel, danger or a fight. If I die, my cousin, king of Aragon will inherit, uniting our kingdoms. If My queen births a son, then he is my heir. This is still a secret, but it is already agreed between myself and my cousin king Alfonso. 

We must face this enemy with both eyes open. And we must be prepared to fight and to get hurt. But we know this already. We fear no infidel. 

Now, lets finilize our plan. You leave with 300 and the treasury to use on the walls. Only if the city has already fallen will this money not be used on the walls. Keep in communication while we prepare for the other 700 to come as well. When can you leave and how fast can we assemble the 300 men? The treasury is already prepared.

26 nov 2025

Calculated military assembly timelines and logistical requirements for expedition












The three Masters exchange glances at the revelation of the succession arrangement. Don Luis's eyes widen almost imperceptibly—this is significant political intelligence, the kind that reshapes how one thinks about the realm's future. Don Pedro absorbs it with a soldier's pragmatism. Sotomayor simply nods, filing it away.

But Juan has made clear the discussion of risk is closed. They are moving to logistics now.

Sotomayor's mind visibly shifts to practical matters. He turns to his fellow Masters.

"Don Luis. How quickly can Santiago muster one hundred fifty knights at a designated assembly point?"

Don Luis considers. "Santiago's knights are spread across eighty-three commanderies. Extremadura, Murcia, Andalucía, León." He strokes his beard. "If I send riders today with summons bearing the royal seal... three weeks to gather one hundred fifty quality men with horses and equipment. Faster if we accept whoever is nearest rather than selecting our best, but for a mission of this importance—" he shakes his head. "Three weeks. Perhaps four if we want them properly supplied."

Don Pedro speaks next. "Calatrava is more concentrated. Campo de Calatrava, the frontier fortresses—most now without purpose since Granada fell. I can have one hundred knights assembled in two weeks. Perhaps eighteen days to be certain they have everything they need."

Sotomayor nods. "Alcántara is smallest and most compact. Fifty knights in two weeks. I will select men personally—those with experience in garrison command, assessment, the kind of careful judgment this mission requires."

He turns to Juan.

"The crown soldiers are Your Majesty's to command. How quickly can thirty men be made ready?"

Before Juan can answer, Álvaro de Luna speaks quietly. "A week. Perhaps less. We have capable men in Toledo who could depart within days if needed."

Sotomayor processes this, then addresses Juan directly.

"Your Majesty, the constraint is Santiago—the largest contingent from the most dispersed Order. If Don Luis sends riders tomorrow, we could have all three hundred assembled by..." he calculates silently, "...the first week of August. Call it August seventh to allow for delays."

He continues, thinking aloud now.

"Assembly point should be a port. No sense gathering in Toledo only to march to the coast. I would suggest Valencia or Cartagena—both have harbors capable of handling a force this size, and both offer the shortest route into the Mediterranean."

Don Luis interjects. "Valencia. Better shipwrights, more Genoese and Venetian traders who know the eastern routes. We can contract passage there more easily than Cartagena."

Sotomayor nods. "Valencia, then. Assembly by August seventh." He pauses. "Ships for three hundred knights, horses, equipment, and sixty thousand florins in treasury. That requires planning. Has Your Majesty already arranged transport, or must we contract vessels?"

He is thinking through every element now—the commander's mind fully engaged.

"If ships must be contracted, we should send word to Valencia immediately. Arranging transport for this force could take as long as assembling it. The treasury especially—we need secure vessels, trustworthy captains. Sixty thousand florins is a tempting prize for pirates or unscrupulous merchants."

He looks at Juan, awaiting answers on the naval logistics before offering a final timeline.

I will put the crown treasury at your disposal to find ships to travel to Constantinople. Use Cartagena to depart from. Send us a message early 1434 so we can leave in the spring with the rest. Unless the city is under immediate threat to fall, I will leave in spring 1434. 

Well, master Don Sotomayor. It is your operation now. Do you have everything you need in order to fulfill your purpose?

26 nov 2025

Evaluated command readiness and identified key operational considerations





Sotomayor rises from his chair. The movement is deliberate—a soldier accepting command.

"Your Majesty has given me authority, funds, and clear purpose. That is more than most commanders receive."

He pauses, running through a mental inventory.

"Three matters remain."

He raises one finger. "First: the decree placing me in command of all Castilian forces in Constantinople, including the seventeen men already present. I will need this in writing, with the royal seal, before I depart. The men there do not know me. They must see Your Majesty's authority, not merely hear my claim to it."

A second finger. "Second: communication. Messages from Constantinople to Castile will travel slowly—weeks at best, months if weather or war disrupts the routes. I propose establishing a relay through Venice or Genoa. Merchants travel those routes regularly. A letter entrusted to the right trading house can move faster than any courier we send alone. With Your Majesty's permission, I will arrange this and send word of which merchant houses to trust with return correspondence."

A third finger. "Third: diplomatic authority. When I stand before the Greek Emperor, what may I promise on Your Majesty's behalf? I understand the sixty thousand florins and the three hundred knights are committed. But if Emperor John asks for more—more men, more gold, a formal alliance—what am I permitted to say?"

He lowers his hand.

"I do not wish to overpromise and shame Castile. Nor do I wish to seem cold and lose Greek confidence. Clear boundaries will help me navigate whatever I find there."

He looks at Juan steadily.

"Answer these three questions, and I will have everything I need. Alcántara will not fail you, Your Majesty. Nor will Santiago or Calatrava." A glance at the other Masters, acknowledging their contribution. "We go as one force. Three crosses, one purpose."

Alvaro; draft the decree for Don Juan today. 

Good, set up this communication system. 

I have made promises and you can be clear to the emperor that I will keep my word. Your task is to help repair the walls and to help man it as well. I will travel to the city myself, so leave any further promises and diplomacy to me. You will be on your own for a while so I want you to act on your own initiative, you know what our position is. 

Now, if that is everything, we can move on to the other goal: morocco and the continuation of the reconquista. Taking and keeping the coastal cities are a difficult goal, but hopefully achievable. What are your thoughts?

26 nov 2025

Analyzed character dynamics and prepared engaging discussion on Morocco






Sotomayor inclines his head. "Your Majesty has answered my questions. I will not fail this trust." He sits, his portion of the council concluded for now.

Álvaro makes a quiet note regarding the decree.

The atmosphere shifts as the topic changes. Constantinople is distant, abstract—a city none of them have seen, an enemy they know only by reputation. Morocco is different. Morocco is visible from Castilian shores. The Moors they would fight there are cousins to the Moors they have fought for centuries.

This is familiar ground.

Don Luis de Guzmán straightens in his chair, and there is a subtle change in his bearing. Constantinople was Sotomayor's moment. Morocco is Santiago's domain.

"Your Majesty raises the question that has occupied my thoughts since Granada fell," he says, his voice carrying new weight. "What now? The Reconquista is complete in Iberia. But across the strait, the Moor still holds cities that were once Christian. Ceuta. Tangier. The coast that faces our own shores."

He leans forward.

"Santiago has studied this question for decades. My predecessors wrote memoranda on it. We have always known that finishing the work meant crossing the water." His eyes sharpen. "But crossing the water changes everything. In Granada, we fought with our backs to Castile. Supply lines measured in days. Reinforcement always possible. In Morocco..."

He shakes his head slowly.

"In Morocco, we fight with our backs to the sea. Every sack of grain, every replacement horse, every fresh soldier must come by ship. If the sea is closed to us—by weather, by enemy galleys, by simple misfortune—our garrisons starve."

Don Pedro nods grimly. "I have held sieges. I know what hunger does to men. A fortress can hold against assault for months. Against starvation?" He shrugs. "Weeks. Perhaps less."

Don Luis continues. "The Portuguese have learned this. They took Ceuta eighteen years ago—" he glances at Juan, "—Your Majesty's father-in-law led that assault himself, when he was younger. They still hold it. But holding it has cost them dearly. Constant supply runs. Garrison rotations. The Moors pressing always, always, waiting for weakness."

He spreads his hands on the table.

"Taking a coastal city is not the difficulty, Your Majesty. With enough ships and enough men, we can take any port on that coast. Holding it—holding it for years, for decades, for centuries—that is the challenge. That is where the Orders become essential."

He pauses, gathering his thoughts.

"What does Your Majesty envision? A single port, as the Portuguese hold Ceuta? Multiple cities along the coast? A true conquest, pushing inland toward Fez and Marrakesh?"

He waits for Juan's answer, but his expression suggests he has opinions on which approach is wise—and which is folly.

Can we take a coastal city, install a muslim as vassal in that city and establish outposts nearby to help them defend it against raids and attacks from the rest of morocco?

26 nov 2025

Weighed vassal strategy's sophistication against religious and practical complications










A long silence follows Juan's question.

The three Masters exchange glances—not the subtle political calculations of earlier, but genuine surprise. This is not what they expected.

Don Pedro speaks first, his brow furrowed. "A Muslim vassal? Your Majesty would take a city and then... give it to a Moor?"

His tone is not hostile, merely confused. This does not fit the framework he has operated within for his entire military career.

Don Luis raises a hand, forestalling further reaction from Don Pedro. The Master of Santiago's expression has shifted to something more thoughtful—the look of a man encountering an idea he has not considered before and finding it worthy of examination rather than dismissal.

"Your Majesty proposes something... unconventional," he says slowly. "Let me be certain I understand. We take a coastal city—Tangier, let us say, or Asilah. Rather than garrison it with Castilian troops and Christian settlers, we install a local ruler—a Muslim—who governs as Your Majesty's vassal. He administers the city, handles the population, maintains order. And we..."

He trails off, working through the implications.

"We establish outposts nearby. Fortified positions. Not to rule, but to protect. To ensure that when the Sultan of Fez or some tribal confederation comes to punish this vassal for his submission to a Christian king, he finds Castilian steel between him and his target."

He sits back, fingers drumming on the table.

"It is clever. I will grant that. It addresses the core problem—administration and supply. A Muslim vassal rules Muslims. He knows the language, the customs, the politics. He can extract taxes, maintain order, negotiate with neighbors in ways no Castilian governor ever could. And our burden becomes purely military. Outposts. Patrols. Relief forces when needed."

Don Pedro still looks troubled. "But the Orders exist to fight the Moor. To drive out the infidel. To plant the cross where the crescent stood. How do we explain to our knights that they are now... protecting a Muslim city? Guarding a Muslim lord?"

Sotomayor, who has been listening quietly, speaks up. "We protected Muslim lords during the Reconquista. Vassal taifas paid parias to Christian kings for generations. The Orders served kings who took that money." He shrugs. "This is not so different. The goal is not to convert every soul in Morocco tomorrow. The goal is to establish Castilian power on that coast. If a Muslim vassal serves that purpose better than direct rule..."

Don Luis nods slowly, but raises a finger. "The strategy has merit. But it rests on a foundation that may be sand." His eyes meet Juan's. "Where do we find this vassal?"

He begins to enumerate the problem.

"A Muslim lord willing to submit to a Christian king makes himself a traitor to his faith, his people, his culture. The Sultan of Fez will declare him apostate. Other lords will compete to destroy him and claim the glory. His own people may murder him in his bed rather than live under a 'collaborator.'"

He spreads his hands.

"Your Majesty has seen this in Granada. Commander Martín converted and served faithfully—but he converted. He became Christian. His men followed him into baptism. A Muslim vassal who remains Muslim..." Don Luis shakes his head. "He is neither one thing nor the other. Too Christian for Morocco. Too Muslim for Castile. Who is this man? Where do we find him? And why would he accept a position that makes him a target for everyone?"

Don Pedro adds, more practically: "And even if we find such a man—can we trust him? What prevents him from accepting our aid, establishing himself, and then betraying us the moment he feels strong enough? We would have handed him a city and then watched him close the gates against us."

The questions hang in the air. The Masters are not rejecting the proposal—indeed, Don Luis seems genuinely intrigued—but they are probing its weaknesses.

Sotomayor offers a quieter observation. "Your Majesty mentioned informants already sent to Morocco. Commander Martín's mission." He pauses. "Is this why? To find such a man? To identify someone who might accept this arrangement?"

The alternative is to appoint a Christian lord, but I fear that the populace will find it very hard to be ruled by him. Although...if the christian ruler is very well informed by muslim customs, maybe a converted moor? Maybe that would not be as bad. We can use the system the order of Santiago has used to settle lands and make them Christian. Either way, we must know very carefully mwhat we are getting into.

26 nov 2025

Weighed converted Moor alternative and Santiago's settlement expertise









Don Luis de Guzmán leans forward, and there is a new energy in his bearing. Juan has invoked Santiago's settlement system—the Order's proudest achievement beyond mere military victory.

"Now Your Majesty speaks of something I know well," he says. "Santiago has settled more frontier land than any other Order. We did not merely conquer—we transformed. Muslim villages became Christian towns. Mosques became churches. But not overnight. Never overnight."

He rises, beginning to pace as Sotomayor did earlier. This is his domain now.

"The system works thus: when we take territory, we do not immediately expel every Muslim. That would be foolish—we would inherit empty fields, silent workshops, dead markets. Instead, we establish authority. Christian lords, Christian law, Christian churches. But the Muslim population remains, at first. They work. They pay taxes. They see that Christian rule is not the catastrophe their imams promised."

He turns to face Juan.

"Then, gradually, we settle Christians among them. Farmers from Castile and León, seeking land. Merchants looking for opportunity. Priests building parishes. Over years—sometimes decades—the balance shifts. Muslims convert, or emigrate, or simply... fade. Their children grow up surrounded by Christians. Their grandchildren attend Mass."

Don Pedro nods. "I have seen this in Calatrava's territories. It is slow. But it works."

"It works," Don Luis agrees, "because it is patient. And because the frontier was connected to Castile. Settlers could walk to their new homes. Priests could visit their bishops. If trouble arose, reinforcement was days away, not weeks."

He stops pacing, his expression growing more serious.

"Morocco is different. Settlers cannot walk across the strait. Every Christian farmer, every merchant, every priest must come by ship. The numbers will be smaller. The process slower. The isolation greater."

He returns to his seat, thinking aloud.

"A converted Moor as governor... yes. This has merit. He knows the people, the customs, the language. He can administer in ways a Castilian knight never could. And if he is genuinely converted—not merely performing for advantage—he has reason to want Christian success. His salvation depends on it."

Don Pedro interjects, his practical soldier's mind at work. "Commander Martín. He is exactly this—a converted Moor of high rank, proven in battle, trusted by Your Majesty. Is he not already in Morocco on the intelligence mission?"

Sotomayor adds quietly, "And Fernando—the former qadi. A scholar who converted genuinely, examined by cardinals in Rome. He understands the theological dimensions. How to present Christian rule to Muslim populations without provoking immediate holy war."

Don Luis nods slowly. "These are the men who could make such a system work. Converted Moors who believe in what they are doing, not merely opportunists seeking advantage." He pauses. "But they are few. Two men cannot govern a coast. We would need more—and finding Muslims of quality who will genuinely convert, not merely mouth words for profit, is..."

He searches for the right word.

"Rare. It happened at Granada because Your Majesty's victory was so total, so clearly divine judgment. That broke something in men like Commander Martín. They did not convert for advantage—they converted because their world had ended and they needed to understand why."

His eyes meet Juan's.

"Can we replicate that in Morocco? Without conquering the entire sultanate?" He shakes his head slowly. "I do not know. Perhaps Commander Martín's mission will tell us. Perhaps he will find men whose faith is already shaken, who are ready to hear a different truth."

Don Pedro speaks, bringing the discussion back to concrete planning. "Your Majesty is right that we must know carefully what we are getting into. What do we know now? Commander Martín departed—when? April? We will not hear from him until autumn at earliest. Should we wait for his report before planning further? Or begin preparations now?"

Don Luis adds: "And what preparations? Ships? Knights? Settlers? The Order of Santiago can begin identifying families willing to emigrate—we have done this before. But we should not promise them land we have not yet taken, in cities we have not yet chosen."

The three Masters look to Juan, awaiting direction. The conversation has shifted from skepticism to genuine strategic planning—but they need to know how fast the King intends to move, and how much depends on intelligence they do not yet have.

Before we go on, we need to know why we are going into Morocco. Firstly, it's trade. We can channel trade from Africa into our markets. Also, taking the port cities prevents pirates from operating easily. Secondly, we can convert more to christianity and further drive back our ancient enemy, Islam. 

Now, there is much we do not know yet. But I do know one thing: We cant just go in, take a port city and garisson it. That will fail. We need to know exactly how we are going to hold the city, what the population thinks, who to put in power. 

I think that for now, we just need to await the return of the informants and reconvene again when they have returned. Only then can we to really start to plan. Target what ports to take if any, know what role every order shall have. 

Do you agree?

26 nov 2025

Anticipated measured agreement from Masters on strategic patience








The three Masters nod almost in unison.

Don Luis speaks first, and there is visible approval in his voice. "Your Majesty shows wisdom that many kings lack—the patience to wait for knowledge before committing men to die."

He settles back in his chair, the tension of the earlier discussion fully dissipated now.

"Trade and faith. These are sound reasons for Morocco. Not mere glory-seeking or restless ambition. The pirates of the Barbary coast have plagued our shipping for generations—Castilian merchants would pay handsomely to see those nests cleared. And extending Christendom..." he inclines his head, "...that is what the Orders exist to do."

Don Pedro adds, with evident relief: "I have seen too many campaigns launched on assumption and hope. Íllora taught me what happens when we do not know what we face." A shadow crosses his weathered face—the memory of that failed assault still raw. "Waiting for Commander Martín's report is not weakness. It is sense."

Sotomayor, whose mind is clearly already half in Constantinople, offers a practical observation. "The timing may work well, Your Majesty. I depart for the East within weeks. Commander Martín's mission reports in autumn—October, November perhaps. By the time Your Majesty has digested that intelligence and reconvened this council, I will have sent my own reports from Constantinople. You will know whether the East demands more resources, or whether Castile's strength can be turned toward Morocco."

He pauses.

"If Constantinople is holding, if the walls are repaired and the Greeks can sustain themselves with the aid we provide—then perhaps Morocco becomes the priority for 1435. But if Constantinople is falling, if the Ottomans are massing for final assault..." He shrugs. "Then Your Majesty faces a different choice entirely."

Don Luis nods gravely. "Two fronts, thousands of miles apart. Castile is strong, but not infinite. We cannot save Constantinople and conquer Morocco simultaneously. Not without breaking ourselves."

He looks to Juan.

"So yes, Your Majesty. We agree. Wait for intelligence. Reconvene when we know more." A slight smile crosses his face—the first genuine warmth he has shown. "In the meantime, Santiago will begin quiet preparations. Identifying potential settlers. Reviewing our records on North African ports—we have archives, maps, reports from merchants and spies accumulated over decades. When the time comes to plan, we will not start from ignorance."

Don Pedro offers: "Calatrava will do the same. Our fortress-builders have experience that may translate to holding coastal fortifications. I will have them study what we know of Moroccan defenses—how they build, how they assault, what works against them."

Sotomayor smiles slightly. "Alcántara will be... otherwise occupied. But if I learn anything in Constantinople that bears on Morocco—Ottoman naval tactics, methods of holding distant outposts—I will include it in my reports."

The meeting has reached its natural conclusion. The Masters appear satisfied—genuinely so, not merely compliant. They have been heard, consulted, included in genuine strategic discussion. The transition from autonomous Orders to crown authority has been handled with respect for their expertise and their dignity.

Don Luis rises, and the others follow.

"Your Majesty. This has been..." he searches for the right words, "...not what I expected when I rode to Toledo. I expected to be informed of decisions already made. Instead, I have been asked to counsel. To contribute." He inclines his head. "The Orders will serve the crown faithfully. You have my word—and I believe I speak for my brothers as well."

Don Pedro and Sotomayor nod their agreement.

"Is there anything else Your Majesty requires of us before we depart to our duties?"

I draw my sword and kiss the blade. 

The pope has released his authority, granting us together the power to set out on a new path, a new destiny. There is power in this room when we together set our minds to a single purpose. Let this be the beginning of a new partnership between crown and the orders where we will fight for God's glory in new lands. 

I lift up my sword, inviting the others to join me as well. 

Deus Vult!

Assessed earned momentum and calibrated NPC response authenticity








ANALYSIS: THE MASTERS' RESPONSE TO JUAN'S INVOCATION
Context:
Juan has concluded a meeting that began with significant concerns (roll: 15) but evolved through genuine consultation into something approaching partnership. He now draws his sword, kisses the blade, invokes "Deus Vult," and invites the Masters to join him in this symbolic moment of unity.

Psychology Assessment:
Positive Factors:

The meeting genuinely went well after rocky start
Masters were consulted, not dictated to
Their concerns were addressed (Alcántara charter, future consultation)
Sotomayor elevated with major command
Don Luis explicitly acknowledged positive surprise
Clear purpose and missions established
"Deus Vult" invokes their deepest identity as crusading Orders
Medieval warriors respond powerfully to symbolic moments
Juan has earned this gesture through the meeting's conduct
Potential Hesitations:

Initial reaction was cautious (roll: 15)—some wariness may linger
Don Luis is political, might find theatrical gestures undignified
Permanent crown control is still new reality—resentment not fully dissolved
Spontaneous displays can feel forced if mood isn't right
Three proud men asked to follow a king half their age
Individual Considerations:

Don Pedro González de Padilla — Most likely to respond emotionally. Has wept at Juan's speeches before. If anyone joins first, it's him.

Don Juan de Sotomayor — Just received major command and written charter guaranteeing his Order's survival. Goodwill is high. But he's also calculating—will watch what the senior Masters do.

Don Luis de Guzmán — The key. Most senior, most political, most guarded. If he joins wholeheartedly, the others certainly follow. If he holds back, the moment falls flat.

D100 TABLE: RESPONSE TO "DEUS VULT"
Roll	Outcome
1-10	Awkward Hesitation — The moment falls flat. The Masters exchange uncertain glances. Don Luis's hand moves toward his sword but stops. Don Pedro looks willing but waits for the senior Master. The silence stretches. Eventually they offer muted responses, swords half-raised, voices quiet. The invocation dies in the air. Juan has misjudged the mood—the meeting went well, but not this well. Trust is building, but brotherhood cannot be rushed.
11-25	Dutiful Compliance — The Masters draw swords and respond "Deus Vult," but there is formality rather than fire in their voices. They are honoring their king, not sharing his passion. Don Luis's expression remains guarded even as he participates. The gesture is completed, but it feels like ceremony rather than transformation. Respect has been established; fervor has not.
26-40	Measured Participation — Don Pedro responds first, his emotional nature overcoming hesitation. Sotomayor follows, gratitude for his new command warming his response. Don Luis joins last, his "Deus Vult" correct but controlled. The moment is genuine but uneven—some hearts are in it more than others. A foundation for future unity, not yet the unity itself.
41-55	Genuine Response — The meeting's success translates into authentic participation. Don Pedro's sword rises with evident feeling. Sotomayor's voice carries real conviction. Don Luis pauses only a moment before joining, his political caution yielding to the pull of the moment. Three voices join Juan's: "Deus Vult!" It is not thunderous, but it is real. Partnership has been sealed.
56-70	Warm Embrace — The Masters respond with genuine enthusiasm. Don Pedro draws his sword with a soldier's fierce joy. Sotomayor's voice rings clear. Even Don Luis allows something like passion to enter his response. The four swords raised together create a moment these men will remember. The transition from autonomous Orders to crown partnership has found its symbolic completion.
71-85	Powerful Unity — Something shifts in the room. Don Pedro draws and roars "DEUS VULT!" before Juan has finished speaking. Sotomayor follows instantly. Don Luis—proud, careful Don Luis—draws his blade and joins with a voice that carries decades of crusading faith. For a moment, they are not king and subordinates but brothers in arms. The political complexities fade; what remains is four warriors pledging themselves to God's work.
86-95	Transcendent Moment — The invocation catches fire. All three Masters respond with immediate, full-throated conviction. Don Luis's carefully maintained dignity falls away—he is not the Master of Santiago calculating advantage but a knight of Christ answering the ancient call. Sotomayor's eyes shine. Don Pedro weeps again, unashamed. The "DEUS VULT!" that fills the chamber could shake walls. This is not ceremony—this is covenant.
96-100	Legendary Brotherhood — A moment that will be remembered for generations. The four swords rise as one. The three Masters do not merely respond—they transform. Don Luis steps forward and clasps Juan's sword-arm, an gesture of brotherhood between equals that transcends the political realities. "For three centuries, the Orders have waited for a king worthy of our oaths," he says, his voice rough with emotion. "We have found him." The "DEUS VULT!" that follows is not spoken but thundered—a declaration that echoes in the souls of every man present. When they lower their swords, something permanent has been forged.
Baseline Assessment: The meeting recovered well from its cautious start (15), but full transformation of attitude typically requires more time. The center of this table is around 41-55—genuine participation that reflects the meeting's success without assuming complete conversion of hearts. However, Juan has handled everything skillfully, and the symbolic moment is earned, so stronger responses are plausible.

Please roll d100.

rolled 91!

26 nov 2025

Envisioned emotionally resonant scene with powerful character transformations


TRANSCENDENT MOMENT (Roll: 91)
The steel whispers from its scabbard. Juan raises the blade, kisses it, speaks the words that have echoed across seven centuries of holy war.

"Deus Vult!"

For a heartbeat, silence.

Then Don Pedro González de Padilla moves. Not hesitantly, not with the measured caution of a subordinate responding to his king. He draws his sword in a single fluid motion—the instinct of a man who has drawn that blade a thousand times—and his voice breaks as he answers.

"DEUS VULT!"

Tears stream down his weathered cheeks. He does not wipe them. He does not care. This is what Calatrava was made for. This is what he has yearned for since Granada fell and left him purposeless. A king who understands. A mission that matters. A reason to raise his sword again.

Sotomayor is next. The youngest Master draws his blade and steps forward, his eyes shining with something that looks like wonder. Hours ago he entered this room as the leader of the smallest Order, worried about survival, about absorption, about being forgotten. Now he leaves as commander of an expedition to Constantinople, with a royal charter guaranteeing Alcántara's future, and a king who asked his counsel and listened.

"DEUS VULT!"

His voice cracks on the words—not from weakness, but from the weight of meaning they carry.

And then Don Luis de Guzmán.

The Master of Santiago has maintained his composure through everything. Through the revelation of papal authority. Through the difficult questions. Through watching Sotomayor rise to unexpected prominence. He is a political creature, a man who has survived thirty years of Order politics by never showing more than he intends.

But something breaks in him now.

Perhaps it is the sight of Don Pedro weeping without shame. Perhaps it is Sotomayor's shining eyes. Perhaps it is simply the accumulation of everything—the completed Reconquista, the king who returned the crusade treasury instead of keeping it, the genuine consultation where he expected mere command.

Perhaps it is older than all of that. Perhaps it is the boy who took his vows sixty years ago, who knelt before the altar of Santiago and swore to fight God's enemies until his dying breath, who has spent decades watching that sacred purpose slowly drown in politics and revenue disputes and petty territorial squabbles.

Don Luis de Guzmán draws his sword.

The blade rises. His arm does not tremble. But his voice—his careful, measured, political voice—breaks.

"DEUS VULT!"

The words tear out of him with a force that surprises even himself. This is not the Master of Santiago, calculating advantage. This is Luis de Guzmán, Knight of Christ, answering the call he first answered as a boy.

Four swords rise together. Four voices thunder as one.

"DEUS VULT!"

The sound fills the chamber. It echoes off stone walls that have witnessed centuries of royal councils, but nothing quite like this. Not politics. Not negotiation. Covenant.

Don Pedro is openly sobbing now, his sword still raised, his face a ruin of tears and fierce joy. Sotomayor stands straight as a lance, transformed from the cautious junior Master into something else entirely—a man who has found his purpose.

And Don Luis—

Don Luis steps forward. He reaches out with his free hand and grasps Juan's sword-arm, just above the wrist. It is a gesture of brotherhood. Of equality. The kind of touch that passes between men who have bled together.

"I have served three kings," he says, his voice rough, stripped of all political varnish. "Your grandfather, who was weak. Your father, who was distracted. And you."

He tightens his grip.

"I did not expect to find a king worthy of the Orders. I had stopped hoping for one. I came here today prepared to manage a transition, to preserve what could be preserved, to ensure Santiago survived the loss of its independence."

His eyes—wet, though he would never admit it—meet Juan's.

"I was wrong. You are not ending the Orders' purpose. You are restoring it. You are giving us back what we were supposed to be, before we forgot."

He releases Juan's arm and steps back. But the connection remains—visible in his bearing, in the way he holds his sword, in the way he looks at his fellow Masters.

"For Santiago," he says. "For Calatrava. For Alcántara. For Castile."

Don Pedro: "For Christ!"

Sotomayor: "For Constantinople!"

And all of them together, one final time, swords still raised:

"DEUS VULT!"

The moment holds. Stretches. Becomes something that each man present will carry with him until he dies.

Then, slowly, the swords lower. Don Pedro wipes his face with the back of his hand, looking slightly embarrassed but not apologetic. Sotomayor sheathes his blade with the careful reverence of a man handling something sacred. Don Luis clears his throat—once, twice—composing himself.

Álvaro de Luna, who has watched the entire scene from his seat, catches Juan's eye. The Constable's expression is unreadable to anyone who doesn't know him well. But Juan knows him well.

Álvaro is impressed.

More than that: Álvaro is moved. And Álvaro de Luna is not a man who moves easily.

The three Masters stand before Juan—no longer reluctant subordinates accepting papal decree, but brothers-in-arms bound by something older and deeper than politics.

The Military Orders belong to the crown now.

But more importantly: they want to.

We know what to to. I will send for you again brothers when the informants have returned. Until then, walk with God.

26 nov 2025

Orchestrated scene closure and anticipated narrative transition forward



The three Masters bow—not the formal obeisance of subjects to sovereign, but the deeper acknowledgment of men who have recognized something true in one another.

Don Luis de Guzmán speaks for all of them. "Until then, Your Majesty. We will prepare. Santiago will be ready when you call."

"As will Calatrava," Don Pedro adds, his voice still thick with emotion. He has composed himself, but the traces of tears remain on his weathered cheeks. He does not seem ashamed of them.

Sotomayor simply nods. His mind is already turning east—to ships, to knights, to the ancient walls of Constantinople. "I will send word from Valencia before we sail. And from Constantinople as soon as I am able to assess what we face."

He pauses at the door, looking back.

"Thank you, Your Majesty. For the charter. For the command. For—" he struggles for words, then settles on simplicity, "—for seeing what Alcántara could be."

Then they are gone. The sound of their boots echoes down the corridor, fading into the general murmur of the Alcázar.

Álvaro de Luna rises slowly from his seat. He moves to the window, looking out over Toledo's rooftops, his hands clasped behind his back.

"That was well done," he says quietly, without turning. "Better than well done."

A pause.

"I have watched you negotiate with popes and emperors. I have seen you command armies and accept the surrender of sultans. But what you did in this room today..." He shakes his head slowly. "You took three proud men who came here afraid and resentful, and you sent them away as believers."

He turns to face Juan.

"The Orders will follow you now. Not because the Pope commands it. Not because they must. Because they want to." A rare smile crosses his face—genuine, unguarded. "Your father never managed that. Your grandfather certainly didn't. You have accomplished something in a single morning that the crown has failed to achieve for a century."

He inclines his head.

"I will have Sotomayor's decree drafted within the hour. The charter guaranteeing Alcántara's independence by nightfall." He pauses. "Is there anything else Your Majesty requires before I attend to these matters?"

When are the University delegates arriving?

26 nov 2025

Excavated historical records to pinpoint university delegates' arrival






Álvaro consults his mental inventory of the kingdom's affairs—the endless catalogue of appointments, arrivals, and obligations that he carries with him always.

"The Rectors of Salamanca and Valladolid were summoned alongside the Masters," he says. "They travel slower—scholars are not accustomed to hard riding, and they bring books and documents they consider essential."

He pauses, calculating.

"The Rector of Salamanca, Don Diego de Anaya, sent word that he would arrive by the seventh. Valladolid's Rector—Don Lope de Barrientos—perhaps a day or two later. Both should be in Toledo within the week."

He regards Juan with quiet curiosity.

"Sir Thomas Beaumont has been in Toledo throughout, working on the Military Academy curriculum. He can be summoned at Your Majesty's convenience." A slight pause. "You mentioned to me before—questions about gunpowder, about why things work, about universities that study the nature of things rather than merely theology and law."

Álvaro's tone carries no judgment, only interest.

"This is an unusual direction for a king's attention. Most monarchs concern themselves with revenues and armies, not with why fire burns or stones fall." He tilts his head slightly. "May I ask what Your Majesty envisions? It would help me prepare the Rectors for what you intend to discuss with them."

Islam has not only retained knowledge, but has expanded on it as well. How cannons have transformed our military, this innovation could never happen here unless we explore, challenge and discover. If we want to defeat Islam, we must also look beyond our horizon. Go beyond Archimedes and discover new ways of arithmetics. Christian science and knowledge. We must move forward. And the universities will help us do this.

26 nov 2025

Weighed Juan's visionary innovation strategy against practical implementation concerns




Álvaro listens with the focused attention he brings to everything Juan says. His expression shifts subtly as Juan speaks—not skepticism, but the careful consideration of a man encountering an idea outside his usual domain.

"The Moors preserved Aristotle when we had forgotten him," he says slowly. "Their physicians surpass ours. Their mathematicians calculate what our scholars cannot. Their astronomers map the heavens with precision we lack." He nods, acknowledging the truth of Juan's observation. "I have seen what their knowledge built in Granada. The Alhambra's engineering. The irrigation systems that made the Vega bloom. We conquered it—but we do not fully understand how it was made."

He moves back to his seat, lowering himself with the deliberate care of a man whose body reminds him of its age more often than it once did.

"Gunpowder came from the East. The cannon that broke Granada's walls—we did not invent it. We learned it. Adopted it. Improved it, perhaps. But the original discovery..." He spreads his hands. "Not ours."

He is quiet for a moment, thinking.

"What Your Majesty proposes is not merely a university. Salamanca teaches law. Valladolid teaches theology. They preserve and transmit what is already known. They do not—" he searches for the right word, "—discover. They do not ask 'why does gunpowder burn' and then seek the answer through experiment."

His eyes meet Juan's.

"This would be something new. A place where scholars are charged not with memorizing Aristotle but with surpassing him. Where asking dangerous questions is not heresy but duty." A pause. "The Church may have concerns. Rome has not always welcomed those who look beyond accepted doctrine. Galileo's predecessors have faced... difficulties."

He raises a hand before Juan can respond.

"I do not say this to dissuade Your Majesty. I say it so we may prepare for the obstacles. If we are to build a place of Christian discovery, we must do so carefully. Frame it correctly. Ensure Rome sees it as strengthening the faith, not threatening it."

A slight smile crosses his weathered face.

"You have just returned from Basel with papal favor. You have the Pope's ear. If anyone can persuade Rome that Christian science serves God's glory..." He inclines his head. "Perhaps it is the king who completed the Reconquista."

He straightens.

"What would you have me tell the Rectors? That Your Majesty wishes to discuss more than curriculum and funding? That you envision something beyond the traditional university?"

You dont have to tell them anything. I will start with just listening as I always do and we will see what happens next. 

Thank you Alvaro,, that is all for today. 

I go to Isabel and Catalina

26 nov 2025

Orchestrated transition from political matters to intimate family reunion



Álvaro rises and bows—not deeply, but with genuine respect.

"Your Majesty." A pause, and then, more quietly: "Juan. What you accomplished today with the Masters... do not underestimate it. You have bound them to you more surely than any papal decree could. That is rare. That is gift."

He gathers his papers and moves toward the door, then stops.

"Enjoy your family. The Rectors will arrive when they arrive. Constantinople will wait. Morocco will wait. The world will continue turning without your hand on it for an afternoon." A rare gentle note enters his voice. "You have a daughter who is learning to say your name. You have a wife who almost died bringing her into the world and may face that danger again soon. These matters also require a king's attention."

Then he is gone, his footsteps receding down the corridor.

The walk to the royal apartments feels different now. The weight of the morning's negotiations—the careful dance with the Masters, the symbolic covenant, the strategic planning—slides from Juan's shoulders with each step. The affairs of kingdoms give way to simpler things.

He finds them in the small garden courtyard adjacent to Isabel's chambers. The afternoon heat has softened, and someone has set up a canopy for shade. Isabel sits on a cushioned bench, her hand resting on her belly, watching.

Catalina is engaged in serious business.

She has discovered a beetle.

The creature—iridescent green, utterly unaware of its significance—crawls across the flagstones while the Princess of Castile pursues it on hands and knees, her small face set in fierce concentration. Doña Beatriz hovers nearby, ready to intervene if the beetle proves dangerous or the stones too hard.

"Bug," Catalina announces with great authority. "BUG."

Isabel looks up as Juan enters the courtyard. Her face transforms—the careful composure of a queen giving way to something softer, more private.

"The conquering hero returns," she says, a smile playing at her lips. "How were the Masters? Did they kneel? Did they weep? Did they swear eternal loyalty?"

There is gentle teasing in her voice, but also genuine curiosity. She knows what this meeting meant.

It went well. We drew our swords and shouted "Deus Vult!". You know...the things knights do. 

What have you two been doing today?

26 nov 2025

Orchestrated intimate family scene contrasting political affairs



Isabel laughs—a real laugh, bright and unguarded.

"Oh, is that what knights do? Draw swords and shout Latin at each other?" She shifts on the bench, making room for him to sit beside her. "I had wondered. The troubadours make it sound more romantic, but I suspected there was more shouting involved."

She takes his hand as he settles next to her, threading her fingers through his.

"We have had a very demanding day," she says, affecting solemnity. "This morning, Catalina discovered that spoons can be dropped from her chair. Repeatedly. She conducted extensive experiments to determine if they make the same sound every time." A pause. "They do. She was very thorough."

From across the courtyard, Catalina looks up from her beetle, notices Juan, and her face splits into a grin.

"Pa!" She abandons the beetle immediately—its survival now assured—and begins the serious work of toddling across the flagstones toward him. Her balance is still imperfect; she lists slightly to one side, corrects, overcorrects, but does not fall.

"After the spoon experiments, we terrorized Doña Beatriz by hiding behind a tapestry," Isabel continues, watching their daughter's determined progress. "Then we had a nap. Well—she had a nap. I lay very still and was kicked repeatedly from inside." She rubs her belly with her free hand. "This one is restless. More than Catalina was."

Catalina reaches them and immediately begins attempting to climb Juan's leg, arms raised in the universal demand to be lifted.

"Up. Up up up."

Isabel smiles, watching.

"She has been asking for you. 'Where Pa? Where Pa?' Every few minutes since she woke." She squeezes his hand. "You have been claimed, my lord. The Princess requires your attention. I am merely the woman who feeds her."

I pick her up and lift her up high. Then sit down with her on my lap, fussing her hair.

26 nov 2025

Envisioned intimate family scene emphasizing warmth over dramatic tension



Catalina shrieks with delight as she rises into the air, her small hands grabbing at nothing, at everything, at the sky itself. For a moment she hangs suspended above Juan's head, legs kicking, grinning down at him with all six teeth on display.

Then he brings her down to his lap, and she settles there with the satisfied air of a conqueror claiming her throne. She permits the hair-fussing for approximately three seconds before batting his hand away and turning to more important matters.

"Bug," she informs him seriously, pointing back toward where she abandoned her quarry. "Bug go."

"The beetle escaped while you weren't looking," Isabel translates. "A tragedy from which she may never recover."

Catalina twists in Juan's lap, craning to see if the beetle might still be found. When it proves to have vanished entirely, she sighs—a dramatic, world-weary sound that seems far too large for such a small person—and slumps back against his chest.

"Gone," she announces mournfully.

Isabel reaches over and strokes her daughter's hair, her hand brushing against Juan's.

"She has your persistence," she observes. "Once she fixes on something, she cannot be distracted from it. The beetle. The spoons. You." A soft smile. "She spent half the morning carrying your glove around. The one you left on the chair yesterday. She wouldn't let anyone take it from her."

Catalina, as if understanding she is being discussed, looks up at Juan's face and pats his cheek with one small hand. Then she begins the serious work of examining his beard, tugging experimentally at different sections to test their durability.

The afternoon light falls golden through the canopy. Somewhere in the palace, servants go about their duties. Somewhere beyond the walls, an empire waits to be managed, enemies wait to be faced, a church waits to be navigated.

But here, in this courtyard, there is only this: a man, his wife, his daughter, and the simple miracle of being together.

Isabel leans her head against Juan's shoulder.

"I am glad you are home," she says quietly. "I am glad you will be here when this one arrives." Her hand moves to her belly. "I am glad for... all of it."

I kiss Catalina and put her down on the ground. 

I plan to travel to Constantinople in the spring 1434. I will be sailing with my flagship that I have had specially designed for you to travel on as well. I hope you are well enough to come with me. You know, when the time comes.

26 nov 2025

Weighed Isabel's emotional conflict between devotion and maternal responsibility






Catalina accepts being placed on the ground with minimal protest, immediately spotting a pebble that demands investigation. She toddles toward it with renewed purpose.

Isabel has gone very still beside Juan.

For a long moment she says nothing. Her hand remains on her belly, and he can see her processing—the flicker of emotions crossing her face too quickly to catalog. Surprise. Fear. Something that might be hope. Something that might be disbelief.

"Constantinople," she repeats, as if testing whether the word is real.

She turns to look at him fully, searching his face.

"You want me to come with you. To Constantinople." Her voice is careful, measured—the voice of a woman who has learned not to assume she understands what her husband means. "Across the sea. To a city that may be besieged by the Turks. With—"

She stops. Calculates.

"The baby will be six months old. Perhaps seven. Catalina will be two." She looks toward their daughter, who has successfully captured the pebble and is now attempting to determine if it is edible. "You would have us all travel with you? Into..."

She doesn't finish the sentence. Into danger. Into uncertainty. Into the unknown.

Her hand finds his again, gripping tighter than before.

"Juan." Her voice has dropped, become private despite the open courtyard. "I have spent two years watching you ride away. Waiting. Praying. Imagining the worst. When you left for Granada, I thought I would die of the fear before you ever returned."

She takes a breath.

"Are you... are you truly asking me to come with you? Not leaving me behind to wait and wonder, but..." She trails off, and something fragile and wondering enters her expression. "You designed a ship for me?"

Yes. And we will be travelling with a large escort. It will be as safe as it can be. And the flagship "Princess Catalina" has quarters for you and your ladies. It is still going to be a sea journey that will take months, but at least we will be together. 

You dont have to say anything for now, just think about it.

26 nov 2025

Weighed emotional significance against practical concerns of voyage






Isabel is quiet for a long moment.

Her eyes have gone bright—not quite tears, but the shimmer of emotion held carefully in check. She watches Catalina, who has discarded the pebble and discovered a flower growing between the flagstones, now engaged in delicate negotiations with its petals.

When she speaks, her voice is barely above a whisper.

"You named the ship after her."

It is not a question. She is simply holding the fact, turning it over, feeling its weight.

"You designed quarters for me. For my ladies." She swallows. "You were in Rome. In Basel. Negotiating with popes and emperors. And you were thinking about... about how to bring me with you."

Her grip on his hand has not loosened. If anything, it has tightened.

"I have never—" She stops, starts again. "When I married you, I understood what it meant to be a queen. I would manage the household. Bear children. Wait. Pray. That is what queens do. What queens have always done. My mother waited for my father. Her mother waited for hers."

She turns to face him, and now the tears do fall—silent, unashamed.

"No one has ever asked me to come."

She releases his hand only to bring both of hers to his face, cupping his cheeks, holding him there so she can look at him properly.

"I will think about it," she says. "I will think about the children, the dangers, the journey. I will be practical and wise and consider everything carefully."

A small, trembling smile breaks through.

"But Juan—yes. Whatever thinking I do, however many fears I must wrestle with—the answer is yes. I would rather face the Turks at your side than face another year of waiting in Toledo, wondering if you are alive or dead."

She kisses him—soft, quick, fierce.

"Ask me again when the baby is born. I will say yes then too."

I settle against her, making her comfortable and we watch Catalina together.

26 nov 2025

Envisioned tender family moment, eschewing unnecessary drama


The afternoon stretches long and golden.

Isabel settles against him, her head finding the hollow of his shoulder, her body relaxing in a way it rarely does when others are watching. He can feel the swell of her belly against his side—the new life growing there, the future taking shape in the quiet dark.

Catalina has abandoned the flower and discovered something even more fascinating: her own shadow. She stands in a patch of sunlight, waving her arms, watching the dark shape on the flagstones mimic her movements. Her face is a study in concentration.

"Me," she announces, pointing at the shadow. Then, less certain: "Me?"

"She asked me yesterday if the moon was a ball," Isabel murmurs. "She wanted to know if she could catch it." A soft laugh. "I told her it was too far away. She said she would climb."

Doña Beatriz has retreated to the far end of the courtyard, granting them privacy while remaining close enough to retrieve Catalina if needed. The Portuguese lady busies herself with needlework, her presence unobtrusive.

A bee drifts lazily through the garden, investigating the roses that climb the courtyard wall. Somewhere beyond the Alcázar, Toledo goes about its business—markets and churches, merchants and beggars, the endless hum of a city that has stood for a thousand years.

But here, time has slowed.

Catalina grows bored with her shadow and returns to her parents, climbing onto the bench beside Isabel and leaning against her mother's other side. For a moment she is still—an unusual state for her—content simply to be held between them.

"Mama," she says. "Pa."

Then, satisfied that both are accounted for, she closes her eyes.

Isabel's hand finds Juan's across the curve of her belly. Their fingers intertwine.

No words are needed.

The sun continues its slow descent toward evening. The bees drone among the roses. A princess sleeps between her parents, dreaming whatever dreams seventeen-month-old children dream.

And for this one afternoon, the world asks nothing of its king.

I wait until the university masters arrive and have a meeting with them.

26 nov 2025

Orchestrated meeting setup with historical rectors and prepared engaging narrative scene







THE SCHOLARS ARRIVE
July 9, 1433
Alcázar of Toledo
The days between the Masters' departure and the Rectors' arrival pass in a gentle rhythm. Mornings with Catalina. Afternoons with Isabel. Evenings reviewing correspondence with Álvaro—the ordinary business of a kingdom that, for once, demands nothing urgent.

Isabel's pregnancy progresses well. The physicians visit daily, and each day they leave with expressions of cautious optimism that slowly, gradually, shade toward genuine confidence. The baby kicks strongly. Isabel's color is good. The signs that worried them have not materialized.

Juan allows himself to hope.

The Rectors arrive on the ninth of July, within hours of each other—Don Diego de Anaya of Salamanca in the morning, Don Lope de Barrientos of Valladolid by mid-afternoon.

They are a study in contrasts.

Don Diego de Anaya is ancient—nearly eighty years old, a man who has outlived three kings and two popes. He moves slowly, supported by a carved walking stick, but his eyes remain sharp and his mind sharper. He has led Salamanca for over two decades, transforming it into the premier university of Castile. His white hair falls past his shoulders in the style of an earlier generation, and he wears the black robes of a scholar with the easy authority of a man who has worn nothing else for sixty years.

Don Lope de Barrientos is younger—perhaps fifty—and carries himself with the energy of a man still building his legacy. Valladolid is smaller than Salamanca, newer, less prestigious, but Barrientos has ambitions for it. He is known as a theologian of considerable skill, a former confessor to Juan's father, and a man who has navigated Church politics with success. His robes are finer than Anaya's, his manner more polished.

They eye each other with the careful courtesy of professional rivals.

The Meeting Royal Study, Late Afternoon

Juan receives them without ceremony—no throne, no formal court. Just the study where he works, with chairs arranged to facilitate conversation rather than emphasize hierarchy. Álvaro sits nearby, ready to contribute but content to observe. Sir Thomas Beaumont has been summoned as well, standing near the window in his English soldier's practicality.

The Rectors have settled into their seats, wine poured, courtesies exchanged.

Don Diego speaks first, as befits his seniority. His voice is thin with age but carries clearly.

"Your Majesty honors us with this summons. Salamanca stands ready to serve the crown, as it has for two centuries." He inclines his head. "Though I confess, I am curious. Kings summon soldiers and bishops, treasurers and diplomats. It is... unusual... to summon scholars."

Don Lope adds, more carefully: "We received Your Majesty's letter but little explanation of its purpose. We have brought documents on our universities' finances, student enrollments, faculty appointments—whatever Your Majesty might wish to review."

Both men watch Juan with the guarded curiosity of academics uncertain why they have been called before power.

First of all, welcome. I wanted us to meet personally because I understand how important education is for a realm. As you may know, I have started a new program for tax assessors and I require many educated nobles for these and future roles as well. I wanted to make sure you have everything you need to succeed. 

Secondly, I plan to expand the field of education we currently offer. But I value your input and would like to learn how you feel about the field of natural sciences, algebra, astrology and arithmetics. 

Finally, I would like to start a new Universtiy in Grenada to take advantage of the knowledge already there. We have learned from Muslim scolars before and maybe we should do so again. We are getting ready to fight the Ottomans and if we are, we should meet them in every field. Right now, they are just more advanced then we are. I seek to amend this. 

So, now you know why you are here. And now is the time for me to listen to what you have to say.

Analyzed scholar personalities and theological concerns regarding educational reforms








ANALYSIS: THE RECTORS' REACTION
What Juan Has Proposed:
Support for universities — Unambiguously positive. More resources, royal attention, confirmation of their importance.
Expansion into natural sciences, algebra, astrology, arithmetics — More complex. These subjects exist in medieval universities but are not central. Mathematics is taught, but primarily as servant to theology and law. "Astrology" is theologically fraught—astronomy (studying celestial movements) is acceptable, but astrology (divination from stars) has been condemned by various Church authorities.
New university in Granada learning from Muslim scholars — The most provocative element. The Church has a complicated history with Islamic knowledge. Aquinas used Averroes and Avicenna, but there's persistent suspicion of Islamic learning as potentially heretical. A new university also means competition.
Individual Psychology:
Don Diego de Anaya (Salamanca):

80 years old, conservative, guardian of tradition
Salamanca is premier university—new competition threatens primacy
Has seen reform movements come and go
Likely to raise theological concerns
Protective of existing curriculum and methods
But also: genuine scholar who knows Islamic contributions to learning
Don Lope de Barrientos (Valladolid):

Younger, ambitious, politically savvy
Theologian—will be sensitive to doctrinal implications
Former royal confessor—understands how to navigate royal requests
Might see opportunity in new directions
But will be cautious about Church reaction
Valladolid could benefit if Granada university is seen as separate category
Key Sensitivities:
"They are more advanced than we are" — Bold admission that some scholars would find uncomfortable or even offensive.
"Astrology" — Juan may mean astronomy, but the word choice matters. Astrology as divination is condemned.
Learning from Muslims — Can be framed positively (recovering knowledge, using enemy's weapons against them) or negatively (contaminating Christian learning with infidel errors).
Competition — A new university in Granada threatens both existing institutions.
Positive Factors:
Juan is consulting, not dictating
Offering support and resources
Framing around fighting Ottomans gives religious cover
Acknowledges their expertise
Practical emphasis (tax assessors) shows utility
D100 TABLE: THE RECTORS' RESPONSE
Roll	Outcome
1-10	Alarmed Resistance — Both Rectors react poorly. Don Diego raises sharp theological objections to learning from Muslims—"The errors of Averroes nearly corrupted the faith once; shall we invite them again?" Don Lope, sensing danger, distances himself from anything controversial. The mention of "astrology" draws immediate correction and concern. Both oppose the Granada university as unnecessary and potentially heretical. Juan has badly misjudged his audience.
11-20	Defensive Caution — The Rectors exchange worried glances. Don Diego lectures Juan on the proper hierarchy of knowledge—theology supreme, philosophy servant, natural sciences mere curiosities. Don Lope carefully explains why the Church might view Muslim-influenced education with suspicion. Neither directly opposes Juan, but neither offers support. They seek to delay, deflect, and protect their institutions from dangerous innovation.
21-35	Polite Skepticism — The Rectors receive Juan's ideas with professional courtesy but evident reservations. Don Diego acknowledges Islamic contributions to learning "in earlier times" but questions their relevance now. Don Lope raises practical concerns about Church approval for a Granada university. Both are willing to discuss but clearly uncomfortable with the direction. Significant persuasion will be needed.
36-50	Cautious Engagement — The Rectors take Juan's proposals seriously while raising legitimate concerns. Don Diego corrects "astrology" to "astronomy" and explains the distinction carefully. Don Lope notes that learning from Muslim texts has precedent but must be done carefully to avoid doctrinal contamination. Both express concern about the Granada university but are willing to discuss conditions under which it might work. Constructive but guarded.
51-65	Interested but Careful — The Rectors engage genuinely with Juan's vision. Don Diego, despite his age, shows flickers of intellectual curiosity—he knows what Islamic scholars achieved and does not dismiss it. Don Lope sees opportunity for Valladolid in new directions. Both raise concerns (Church approval, proper theological oversight, protecting existing universities) but frame them as problems to solve rather than reasons to abandon the project.
66-75	Thoughtful Reception — The Rectors respond with more enthusiasm than expected. Don Diego surprises by recounting Salamanca's own history of learning from translated Arabic texts. Don Lope suggests frameworks for theological oversight that could satisfy Church concerns. The Granada university idea draws interest rather than opposition—both see potential, though they want safeguards. A genuine collaborative conversation begins.
76-85	Enthusiastic Engagement — Juan has struck a chord. Don Diego, the old scholar, speaks with unexpected passion about knowledge lost and knowledge that might be recovered. Don Lope immediately begins strategizing how to frame this for Church approval. Both Rectors offer concrete suggestions. The competition concern fades as they recognize Juan is proposing something larger than a threat to their enrollments.
86-95	Inspired Response — The Rectors are genuinely excited. Don Diego speaks of dreams he had as a young scholar—of a Christendom that did not merely preserve knowledge but expanded it. Don Lope sees a chance to shape something historic. Both offer not just support but active partnership. They raise concerns only to immediately propose solutions. Juan has found unexpected allies in his vision.
96-100	Transformative Conversation — Something remarkable happens. Don Diego, at eighty years old, speaks with the fire of a young man discovering his calling again. "I have waited my entire life for a king who understood this," he says. Don Lope pledges Valladolid's full cooperation. The conversation becomes a planning session, with both Rectors contributing ideas that expand and improve Juan's initial vision. A genuine intellectual partnership is born.
Baseline Assessment: Juan's proposals are genuinely controversial by 15th-century standards, touching on theological sensitivities, institutional competition, and uncomfortable admissions about Christian-Islamic intellectual relations. However, he has framed them well (fighting Ottomans, consulting rather than dictating) and is offering resources. The center is around 36-50 (Cautious Engagement)—serious scholars taking controversial ideas seriously while raising legitimate concerns.

Orchestrated scholarly dialogue with receptive academic collaboration


THOUGHTFUL RECEPTION (Roll: 67)
A silence follows Juan's words—but it is not the uncomfortable silence of men searching for polite objections. It is the silence of scholars processing something unexpected.

Don Diego de Anaya moves first. The ancient Rector shifts in his chair, and something changes in his face—the guarded formality giving way to something more personal. More alive.

"Your Majesty uses the word 'astrology,'" he says carefully. "I assume you mean astronomia—the study of celestial movements, their mathematics, their patterns. Not astrologia judiciaria—the casting of horoscopes and reading of fates, which the Church rightly condemns."

He waits for Juan's confirmation, then nods slowly.

"The distinction matters. Astronomy is the queen of the mathematical sciences. It requires mastery of geometry, arithmetic, and calculation beyond what most scholars achieve." His thin voice strengthens as he speaks of his subject. "And here, Your Majesty touches on a truth that few kings have understood—or wished to understand."

He leans forward, his ancient hands gripping the arms of his chair.

"When I was a young man—younger than Your Majesty is now—I studied the texts that came to us from Toledo's translation schools. Euclid. Ptolemy. Aristotle. All preserved by Islamic scholars when we had lost them. Al-Khwarizmi's algebra. Ibn al-Haytham's optics. Averroes's commentaries." He pauses. "The very word algorithm comes from al-Khwarizmi's name. We use their knowledge every day without acknowledging its source."

Don Lope de Barrientos stirs, clearly surprised by his elder colleague's direction. But he does not interrupt.

"Salamanca was built on recovered knowledge," Don Diego continues. "We did not create Aristotle—we received him, through Arabic translations, through the work of scholars in Baghdad and Córdoba and Toledo. To pretend otherwise is vanity."

He fixes Juan with a sharp look.

"So when Your Majesty speaks of learning from Muslim scholars again, you do not propose something new. You propose returning to something we have abandoned. The question is not whether it can be done—it has been done. The question is whether it should be done now, and how."

Don Lope seizes the opening, his more political mind already working.

"The theological concerns are real," he says. "Not because Islamic knowledge is inherently corrupt—Aquinas himself used Averroes and Avicenna—but because it must be received carefully. Filtered. Examined for errors that might contradict doctrine."

He steeples his fingers.

"A university in Granada, learning from texts and scholars already present there... this could be framed as recovery. The reconquest of knowledge to match the reconquest of territory. We are not adopting Islamic learning—we are reclaiming what was Christian before it was Muslim, what was Roman before it was Christian."

His eyes sharpen with the look of a man who has navigated Church politics successfully.

"The Pope has blessed Your Majesty's crusade. He has granted you authority over the Military Orders. If this new university is presented as an extension of that mission—as intellectual crusade, if you will—Rome may not merely accept it. Rome may celebrate it."

Don Diego nods slowly. "The boy has a point. Framing matters. A university that studies Islamic texts sounds dangerous. A university that recovers ancient knowledge from infidel occupation sounds heroic."

Both Rectors are leaning forward now, engaged in ways they clearly did not expect to be when they entered this room.

"But there are practical concerns," Don Lope continues. "Who would lead such an institution? Christian scholars who know Arabic are rare. Muslim scholars who might teach are... complicated. Would they convert? Would they be permitted to teach as Muslims? The Church would have questions."

Don Diego adds: "And there is the matter of existing institutions. Salamanca has taught theology and law for two centuries. If Granada begins teaching natural philosophy and mathematics as its primary purpose..." He pauses, and something like a smile crosses his ancient face. "Well. Competition can be healthy. But it must be structured so we strengthen each other rather than fight for the same students."

He looks at Don Lope, and some unspoken negotiation passes between them—old rivals recognizing that this moment is larger than their rivalry.

"Your Majesty mentioned wanting educated nobles for crown service," Don Diego says. "Tax assessors. Administrators. Perhaps... a division of purpose? Salamanca continues its excellence in law and theology. Valladolid in theology and medicine. Granada becomes something new—a place for natural philosophy, mathematics, the practical sciences that Your Majesty rightly notes we must master if we are to face the Ottomans as equals."

Don Lope nods. "Three universities, three purposes, one kingdom. Not competing but complementing."

Sir Thomas Beaumont, who has listened silently from his position by the window, clears his throat.

"If I may, Your Majesty—" He waits for Juan's acknowledgment. "In England, we have Oxford and Cambridge. They compete, yes, but they also drive each other to excellence. What the Rectors propose sounds similar. And from a military perspective..."

He steps forward.

"The Academy I am building trains officers in tactics. But tactics rest on logistics. Logistics rest on mathematics. Mathematics of supply, of siege, of artillery trajectories." He glances at the Rectors. "If Granada produced men who understood these calculations—who could tell a commander exactly how much powder, at what angle, to breach a wall of specific thickness—that would be worth more than a hundred knights."

Don Diego regards the English soldier with new interest. "You speak of practical mathematics. Applied knowledge. This is... not how universities traditionally think. But perhaps it is how they should."

The conversation has transformed. What began as a royal audience has become something closer to a planning session—four minds engaging with a problem, testing ideas, building on each other's thoughts.

Don Lope summarizes: "So. Your Majesty proposes expanded education in natural sciences and mathematics. A new university in Granada focused on recovering and advancing practical knowledge. Support for existing institutions to ensure we strengthen rather than fragment Castilian learning."

He glances at Don Diego, who nods.

"We have concerns. Church approval must be secured—carefully, strategically. Leadership for Granada must be chosen wisely. The balance between institutions must be maintained." He pauses. "But these are problems to be solved, not reasons to refuse."

Don Diego speaks, and his voice carries the weight of eighty years of scholarship.

"I have spent my life preserving knowledge, Your Majesty. Copying manuscripts. Training students. Ensuring that what we know survives to the next generation." He fixes Juan with eyes that have seen much. "But preservation is not enough. You speak of going beyond Aristotle. Of discovery. Of creating knowledge rather than merely guarding it."

A long pause.

"I am too old to see this completed. But I am not too old to help it begin." He inclines his head. "What would Your Majesty have us do?"

Forgive me my mistake. I of course mean astronomy. 

Can we both see what the Grenada university still has in terms of knowledge, to see if it is of use for our Universities? And also restore the learning institution and focus on natural sciences. I want to stay away from theology in Grenada, this is complicated. But if we focus on purely mathematics and natural science, I think it would work.

26 nov 2025

Appraised Juan's strategic scope-narrowing to sidestep theological objections





Don Diego waves a hand, dismissing the correction with the ease of an old teacher who has heard students misspeak a thousand times.

"A natural mistake. The words share a root, and many use them carelessly. Your Majesty's instinct is correct—astronomy is the proper study."

He exchanges a glance with Don Lope, and something passes between them—relief, perhaps, mixed with growing respect for a king who listens and adjusts.

Don Lope speaks first, his political mind already working through implications.

"Avoiding theology entirely is wise. Very wise." He nods slowly. "Mathematics is numbers. Natural science is observation of God's creation. Neither requires doctrinal interpretation. Neither invites accusations of heresy. A scholar studying the trajectory of a cannonball or the movement of stars is not making claims about salvation."

He leans forward, warming to the idea.

"The Church cannot object to arithmetic. The Church cannot condemn geometry. If Granada studies how things work rather than why God made them so—" he spreads his hands, "—Rome has no grounds for concern. We are simply understanding Creation more fully, which glorifies the Creator."

Don Diego's ancient eyes have taken on a keen light.

"An assessment of what remains in Granada... yes. This should be done quickly, before more is lost." His voice carries sudden urgency. "When cities fall, libraries burn. Manuscripts are used for kindling by soldiers who cannot read them. I have seen it happen. If Granada's scholars left texts behind—if there are collections we do not yet know of—"

He turns to Juan directly.

"Your Majesty, do you know what survived? The madrasas, the libraries, the private collections of learned men? Has anyone catalogued what remains?"

Sir Thomas interjects quietly: "When the city fell, Your Majesty ordered the Alhambra preserved. But I do not know if anyone thought to preserve books."

Don Diego makes a sound of frustration. "Books are worth more than palaces. A palace is stone. A book is a thousand years of thought."

Don Lope raises a calming hand. "Then this is the first task. Send scholars to Granada—men who can read Arabic, who know what to look for. Let them assess what remains before we plan what to build."

He looks at Don Diego. "Salamanca has such men. A handful. I can spare one or two from Valladolid as well."

Don Diego nods slowly. "I have three who might serve. Old students of mine who learned Arabic to read Averroes in the original. They are not young, but they know how to recognize valuable texts." He pauses. "If Your Majesty will provide safe passage and accommodation, I will send them within the month."

Don Lope steers back to the larger question.

"So. An assessment first. Then, based on what we find, we design the institution." He ticks off points on his fingers. "A university focused on natural philosophy and mathematics. No theology—that remains with Salamanca and Valladolid. No doctrinal instruction that might draw Church scrutiny."

He considers further.

"We will need faculty. Some can come from our existing universities—scholars whose interests lean toward natural science but who have no outlet for them currently. They exist. They are often considered... eccentric." A slight smile. "Perhaps in Granada, eccentricity becomes virtue."

Don Diego adds: "And some might come from the converted scholars of Granada itself. Men who knew Islamic learning but have accepted baptism. Men like—" he pauses, searching memory, "—Your Majesty's advisor, the former qadi. Fernando, yes? A scholar who converted genuinely, examined by Rome itself. Such men could bridge both traditions."

He strokes his chin thoughtfully.

"A university of natural sciences, led by Christian scholars, drawing on Islamic texts and methods, producing men who understand mathematics, astronomy, optics, engineering..." His voice has grown distant, seeing something beyond the room. "It would be unique in Christendom. Perhaps unique in the world."

Don Lope brings the conversation back to earth.

"There is still the question of Church approval. Even without theology, a university requires papal charter to grant degrees. Rome will ask questions." He holds up a hand before anyone can object. "I am not saying it cannot be done. I am saying it must be done carefully."

He looks at Juan.

"Your Majesty has the Pope's ear. You have returned from Rome with unprecedented favor. If this is presented correctly—as intellectual reconquest, as preparation for crusade against the Ottomans, as glorifying God through understanding His creation—Eugenius may grant what we ask."

Don Diego nods. "Frame it as Your Majesty framed it to us. We must meet the Ottomans in every field. They are more advanced. We seek to amend this." He gives a thin smile. "Popes understand strategic necessity. And this Pope owes Your Majesty much."

Both Rectors sit back, the initial shape of a plan now visible.

Don Lope summarizes: "Assessment of Granada's surviving knowledge. Design of a new institution focused on natural sciences and mathematics, avoiding theology entirely. Staffing from existing universities and converted scholars. Petition to Rome for charter, framed as extension of the crusade."

Don Diego adds: "And coordination with Salamanca and Valladolid, so we strengthen each other rather than compete. Granada trains mathematicians and natural philosophers. We train lawyers and theologians. The kingdom benefits from all."

He fixes Juan with his sharp old eyes.

"This could take years to build properly, Your Majesty. Perhaps decades. I will not live to see it completed." A pause, and something like peace enters his voice. "But I would very much like to help it begin."

Don Lope nods. "As would I. Valladolid will contribute what it can."

Both Rectors wait, watching Juan, ready to hear what their king would have them do next.

Do you require a decree from me to search the Grenada universities? Or anything else?

26 nov 2025

Weighed practical logistics and formal authorization requirements for scholarly expedition





Don Diego and Don Lope exchange a glance—the practiced communication of men accustomed to navigating institutional requirements.

Don Lope speaks first, his administrative mind already cataloguing necessities.

"A royal letter would smooth many paths, Your Majesty. Granada is newly conquered territory under military governance. Scholars wandering through madrasas and private houses, asking questions, examining documents..." He shrugs. "Without clear royal authority, the Governor might view us as complications. Or worse, as spies."

Don Diego nods. "A letter to Don García López de Padilla—he is still Governor, yes?—instructing him to provide our scholars with access, accommodation, and cooperation. Protection too, if needed. Granada is pacified but not yet peaceful. Resentments linger."

He counts on gnarled fingers.

"We need three things. First, the letter of authority Your Majesty mentions. Second, funds for travel and lodging—modest, but necessary. My scholars are not wealthy men." A dry smile. "Scholarship does not enrich."

"Third," Don Lope adds, "access to those who might know where knowledge is hidden. The converted scholars. The former qadi—Fernando. Even Muslim merchants or craftsmen who might know of private collections." He pauses delicately. "Books are valuable. When a city falls, valuable things disappear. Some may have been hidden, waiting for safer times. Some may have been... acquired... by soldiers who recognized their worth without understanding their contents."

Don Diego's expression darkens at this thought. "A proclamation might help. Offering fair payment for texts brought forward, amnesty for those who took them during the conquest. Better to buy back what was looted than lose it forever."

Sir Thomas shifts by the window. "The army kept reasonable discipline, but no army is perfect. If manuscripts were taken as plunder, some soldiers may still have them—or may have sold them."

Don Lope nods. "A proclamation offering purchase rather than punishment would yield more than threats. Soldiers respond to coin."

Don Diego summarizes: "So. A letter of authority for the scholars. A letter to the Governor requiring cooperation. Funds for the expedition. And a proclamation offering to purchase recovered texts." He tilts his head. "If Your Majesty can provide these, we can begin within the month."

He hesitates, then adds: "One more thing, if Your Majesty permits. A name. Someone in Granada who can serve as guide and liaison. The former qadi Fernando would be ideal—he knows Islamic scholarly traditions, he knows what to look for, and his conversion is beyond question. Is he available?"

Alvaro, draft both the proclamation and the royal letter for these scolars. And allocate funds from the treasury for this task as well. 

Next, draft an official decree founding the Grenada university with the stated research goals. The pope will understand thet we need to develop better if we are to fight the Ottomans. And we will of course respect any theological fields in the new University.

26 nov 2025

Orchestrated administrative tasks and anticipated stakeholder reactions to university founding








Álvaro has been taking quiet notes throughout the conversation. He looks up, his dark eyes carrying that familiar gleam of a man who sees the shape of things coming together.

"It will be done, Your Majesty. The proclamation and letter of authority can be ready by tomorrow morning. I will consult with Don Diego and Don Lope on precise language before finalizing—" he nods to both Rectors, "—to ensure it serves their scholars' needs."

He makes another note.

"Funds I can allocate from the household treasury immediately. A modest sum for travel and initial assessment. Larger allocations can follow once we know the scope of what remains in Granada."

Then he pauses, his quill hovering.

"The founding decree for the university itself... this is a larger matter, Your Majesty. It will require careful drafting. The stated purposes must be precise—natural philosophy, mathematics, astronomy, practical sciences. Explicitly not theology, as Your Majesty wisely noted." He glances at the Rectors. "I would welcome the learned doctors' review before it is finalized. Their knowledge of university charters far exceeds mine."

Don Diego raises a hand, his expression thoughtful.

"Your Majesty moves swiftly. This is... not unwelcome, but perhaps we should discuss sequence." His voice is careful, not contradicting but advising. "A founding decree is a permanent document. It establishes the institution in law. Once issued, it shapes everything that follows."

Don Lope nods agreement. "Might it be wiser to issue the decree after the assessment? Once we know what knowledge survives in Granada, we can craft the university's charter to match reality. If we find great riches in mathematics and astronomy, we emphasize those. If we find more in medicine or optics, we adjust accordingly."

He spreads his hands.

"A delay of two months, perhaps three. The scholars travel to Granada, assess what remains, report their findings. Then Your Majesty issues the founding decree with full knowledge of what we are building upon."

Don Diego adds: "There is also the matter of Rome. A founding decree issued before papal approval risks... complications. If Eugenius grants his charter, all is well. If he hesitates or demands changes, we would need to revise a decree already issued. Better to move in parallel—seek papal approval while conducting the assessment, then issue the founding decree when both are complete."

Álvaro looks to Juan, awaiting direction. His expression suggests he sees merit in the Rectors' caution but will defer to the King's judgment.

Don Lope offers a middle path.

"Perhaps, Your Majesty, a declaration of intent rather than a founding decree? A royal proclamation announcing that Castile will establish a university of natural sciences in Granada, with details to follow. This signals Your Majesty's commitment, begins the process with Rome, but preserves flexibility until the assessment is complete."

Don Diego nods slowly. "This would serve. The scholars travel with clear purpose—they are not merely investigating, they are preparing the ground for a royal institution. The Pope receives word that Castile intends great things and is invited to participate. But the precise charter awaits full knowledge."

There is a brief silence as both Rectors remember the earlier question left unanswered.

"And Fernando, Your Majesty?" Don Diego asks. "The former qadi? Would he be available to guide our scholars? His knowledge would be invaluable."

Álvaro answers before Juan can speak, consulting his notes. "Fernando departed with Commander Martín's delegation to Morocco in April. He is not expected to return until October or November at the earliest."

Don Diego's face falls slightly. "A loss. But not insurmountable. There must be other converted scholars in Granada who might serve."

Don Lope suggests: "The Governor would know. Educated Muslims who converted during or after the conquest. Perhaps not of Fernando's caliber, but capable of identifying what our scholars should seek."

Good. We assess first, then we draft a charter. I plan to visit Rome next spring, and I will take the university grant with me. Im confident I can get papal support. 

But indeed, yes. First the assessment.

26 nov 2025

Orchestrated meeting closure and affirmed strategic consensus



Both Rectors visibly relax. The King has listened. The King has adjusted. This is not a common experience for scholars summoned before power.

Don Diego inclines his head, and there is genuine warmth in the gesture—the respect of an old man for a young one who has surprised him.

"Your Majesty shows wisdom beyond your years. Assessment, then charter, then Rome." He permits himself a thin smile. "This is how scholars work. It is gratifying to find a king who understands the value of knowing before acting."

Don Lope is already thinking ahead. "Spring gives us time. My scholars can depart within the month, spend August through October in Granada, return with their findings by November. That allows the winter to draft the charter properly, with full knowledge of what we are building upon."

He glances at Don Diego. "If Salamanca's scholars work alongside Valladolid's, we can divide the labor. Some focus on mathematical texts. Others on natural philosophy. Others on practical sciences—engineering, optics, medicine."

Don Diego nods. "A joint expedition. Salamanca and Valladolid working together." A dry chuckle escapes him. "That alone may be Your Majesty's greatest miracle. We have spent decades competing. Perhaps it is time we remembered we serve the same kingdom."

Álvaro makes a final note.

"I will have the letters of authority and the proclamation regarding recovered texts ready for Your Majesty's seal tomorrow. Funds will be allocated by week's end." He looks to the Rectors. "If the learned doctors will provide me with the names of their scholars and any specific requirements, I will ensure everything is prepared for their departure."

Don Lope bows his head. "You will have the names within two days, Don Álvaro."

"As will you from Salamanca," Don Diego adds.

Sir Thomas Beaumont, who has listened quietly through the final exchanges, speaks up. "Your Majesty, if I may—the Military Academy would benefit greatly from whatever mathematical knowledge Granada yields. Gunnery, fortification, logistics... these are all mathematics in practice. Perhaps the Academy could send an observer with the scholars? Someone to identify texts of military application?"

Don Diego regards the English knight with that same surprised respect he showed earlier. "A soldier who values books. You are an unusual man, Sir Thomas."

"I am a man who has seen what cannons do to walls built by men who did not understand mathematics," Sir Thomas replies simply. "I would prefer to be on the side that calculates correctly."

The meeting has reached its natural conclusion. The Rectors rise, and there is a different quality to their bearing now—not the guarded formality of men uncertain why they have been summoned, but the purposeful energy of men given meaningful work.

Don Diego approaches Juan and, with the privilege of age, speaks more personally.

"Your Majesty, I have advised kings before. Your father. Your grandfather, briefly, near the end." He pauses, choosing words with care. "They were not bad men. But they did not see. They viewed universities as decorations—proof of civilization, useful for training lawyers, otherwise ignorable."

His ancient eyes meet Juan's.

"You see something different. You see that knowledge is power—not merely the power of arms, but the power to understand. To improve. To surpass." He shakes his head slowly. "I did not expect to find such vision in a king who conquered Granada with swords and cannons."

He bows—lower than strict protocol requires.

"Salamanca will not fail you, Your Majesty. Whatever years remain to me, they are yours."

Don Lope adds his own bow. "Valladolid as well. We will build something worthy of Your Majesty's vision."

They turn to leave, but Don Diego pauses at the door.

"One more thing, Your Majesty. You spoke of meeting the Ottomans in every field. Of surpassing what we have inherited." His voice carries the weight of eight decades. "That work will take generations. You may not live to see it completed. Nor will I—certainly not I."

A pause.

"But if we begin it correctly... if we plant the seeds well... our grandchildren's grandchildren may look back and say: This is where it started. This is when Castile chose to reach beyond what it knew."

He smiles—a rare expression on that weathered face.

"That is worth more than any conquest, Your Majesty. Kingdoms fall. Knowledge endures."

And then they are gone, their footsteps receding down the corridor, leaving Juan with Álvaro and Sir Thomas in a room that feels somehow larger than it did before.

Sit Thomas, be sure to send an observer as well. You are also an institution of learning and should benefit from knowledge in Grenada as well. 

I thank everyone and go to Isabel and Catalina.

26 nov 2025

Orchestrated scene closure, transitioning toward intimate family respite





Sir Thomas straightens, a flicker of genuine pleasure crossing his usually stoic features.

"Thank you, Your Majesty. I will select someone suitable—a man who understands both scholarship and practical application." He pauses, considering. "Young Captain Mendoza, perhaps. He has a head for numbers and an interest in siege engineering. The scholars may find him rough company, but he will know what to look for."

He bows crisply. "With Your Majesty's leave."

Álvaro gathers his notes, already organizing the tasks ahead. "I will have the documents ready for your seal tomorrow, Your Majesty. And I will coordinate with the Rectors and Sir Thomas on the expedition's requirements."

He hesitates at the door, something softening in his expression.

"A good day's work, Your Majesty. The Masters this morning. The Rectors this afternoon. You have bound warriors and scholars alike to your purpose." A rare warmth enters his voice. "Go to your family. You have earned an evening of peace."

The corridors of the Alcázar are quiet in the late afternoon light. Servants move about their duties, nodding respectfully as Juan passes. The weight of the day's negotiations lifts with each step.

He finds them where he expects—in the small garden courtyard that has become their refuge.

Isabel sits on the cushioned bench, her back supported by pillows, a book open in her lap though she does not seem to be reading it. Her eyes are on Catalina, who has discovered a new obsession: a butterfly.

The creature—orange and black, utterly indifferent to royal attention—flutters among the roses. Catalina follows it with the intense, wobbling determination that characterizes all her pursuits, arms outstretched as if she might catch it through sheer desire.

"Fly," she announces. "Fly fly fly."

Isabel looks up as Juan enters, and her face transforms with that smile he has come to treasure—the one that is only for him, unguarded and true.

"The conquering hero returns again," she says softly. "How were the scholars? Did they weep? Did they swear eternal loyalty?"

The echo of her earlier teasing, now a private joke between them.

"Come," she says, patting the bench beside her. "Sit. Watch your daughter attempt the impossible. She has been at this for twenty minutes and shows no signs of surrender."

Catalina, hearing her father's approach, looks up from her butterfly hunt. Her face splits into a grin.

"Pa!" She points urgently at the butterfly, which has landed on a rose. "Fly! Catch!"

The evening light falls golden through the garden. The butterfly drifts lazily from flower to flower. A princess demands the impossible. A queen rests her head on her husband's shoulder.

And for one more evening, the world asks nothing of its king but this.
