      "full_text": "PAPAL BULL \nInter Cetera Divinae Providentiae \n\"Among the Things of Divine Providence\" \nIssued by His Holiness Pope Martin V \nAugust 1, in the Year of Our Lord 1430 \nThirteenth Year of Our Pontificate \nPreamble \nMARTIN, BISHOP, SERVANT OF THE SERVANTS OF GOD \nTo Our beloved son in Christ, JUAN, by the Grace of God King of Castile and LeÔn, and to all the faithful of Christ \nwho shall read these letters: Greeting and Apostolic Blessing. \nAmong the things of Divine Providence which govern the affairs of men, We recognize with profound gratitude those \nmoments when the Holy Spirit moves hearts toward complete submission to God's will and the service of Holy Church. \nSuch a moment has been granted to Us, and through Us, to all Christendom. \nOur beloved son Juan, King of Castile and Leon, having completed pilgrimage to the shrine of Blessed James at \nCompostela, did present himselfbefore Us in Our city of Rome with such profound demonstration of faith and humility \nas We have rarely witnessed in Our long service to Holy Church. \nIn Our presence, this young king did strip himself of crown, wealth, and worldly garments, offering his very person and \nkingdom to God's service through the ministry of the Apostolic See. By this act of complete renunciation and offering, he \nhas shown himselfworthy to be called a true soldier of Christ and a faithful son of the Church. \nMoved by the Holy Spirit and recognizing the sincere faith of this Our son, and considering the great work yet undone in \nthe Iberian lands where the Crescent still holds sway over territories that rightfully belong to the Cross, We have \ndetermined to grant those favors and authorities herein described. \nArticle I: Proclamation of Crusade \nBY THE AUTHORITY OF ALMIGHTY GOD, 0f the Blessed Aposties Peter and Paul, and by Our own authority as \nVicar 0f Christ on Earth, WE DO HEREBY PROCLAIM AND DECREE: \nA plenary and universal CRUSADE against the Moorish Kingdom of Granada, for the recovery of Christian lands \nunjustly held, for the liberation of souls dwelling in the darkness of false belief, and for the completion of that sacred \nReconquista begun by the faithful kings of Spain in ages past. \nThis Crusade is declared to be a work of supreme spiritual merit, undertaken not for earthly gain but for the greater glory \nof God and the salvation of souls. All who participate with pure hearts shall be accounted among the blessed warriors of \nChrist. \nArticle II: Supreme Command \nWE DO APPOINT AND COMMISSION Our beloved son Juan, King 0f Castile and Leon, as SUPREME \nCOMMANDER of this Holy Crusade, with full, complete, and exclusive authority over all military operations, strategic \ndecisions, and temporal governance of crusading forces. \nThis authority includes, without limitation: \nl. Command of All Forces: All Christian forces engaged in this Crusade, whether royal armies, feudal levies, forces \nof the Military Orders, foreign knights, or any other armed Christians, shall be under the sole command of King \nJuan. No lord, prince, master, or commander may refuse his lawful orders or pursue independent military action. \n2. Appointment and Dismissal: The Supreme Commander may appoint subordinate commanders, captains, and \nofficers as he deems necessary for the prosecution of the Crusade, and may dismiss any such officers for cause. He \nmay reorganize military structures as required for effective command. \n3. Strategic Authority: All decisions regarding campaigns, sieges, battles, truces, terms of surrender, and military \nstrategy rest solely with the Supreme Commander. No council, assembly, or individual may override his military \njudgment. \n4. Discipline and Justice: The Supreme Commander has authority to maintain military discipline, to judge military \noffenses, and to punish violations of crusading vows or military orders according to canon law and the laws of war. \nAny Christian who refuses the lawful commands of the Supreme Commander in matters pertaining to this Crusade, or \nwho pursues independent military action contrary to his orders, shall be subject to ecclesiastical censure including \npossible excommunication, and shall forfeit all crusading indulgences and privileges. \nArticle III: The Military Orders \nThe venerable Military Orders of Santiago, Calatrava, and Alcintara, founded for the defense of Christendom and \nthe prosecution of holy war against the enemies of Christ, are hereby commanded and required to commit their full \nstrength to this Crusade. \nWE DO DECREE: \n1. The Masters of these Orders shall place their forces under the Supreme Command of King Juan for the duration of \nthis Crusade. \n2. The Orders shall provide knights, men-at-arms, supplies, and financial support as determined necessary by the \nSupreme Commander. \n3. The Orders retain their internal discipline and religious observances, but in all military matters they serve as \nintegral components of the crusading army under unified command. \n4. Should any Master prove unworthy, disobedient, or unsuited to this holy work, We reserve the right to investigate \nand, if necessary, remove said Master and appoint a successor more fitting for the prosecution of God's work. \nThe Military Orders are reminded that their original purpose was precisely this: to fight for the Cross against the \nCrescent. This Crusade returns them to their sacred founding mission. \nArticle IV: Call to Christendom \nWE DO CALL UPON all faithful Christians, noble and common, clergy and laity, to support this holy endeavor \naccording to their abilities: \nTo Knights and Men-at-Arms: Take up the cross and join this sacred campaign. Your swords are needed for Christ's \nwork. \nTo Lords and Nobles: Provide men, supplies, and financial support. Lead your retinues in holy service. \nTo Merchants and Craftsmen: Support the Crusade with your skills and resources. Just profit from supplying Christ's \narmy carries no shame. \nTo Clergy: Preach this Crusade, encourage the faithful, pray for victory, and accompany the armies as chaplains. \nTo All the Faithful: Even those who cannot take the cross personally may support through prayer, alms, and financial \ncontributions. \nThose who take the crusading vow commit themselves until the Kingdom of Granada is conquered and converted, or \nuntil the Supreme Commander releases them from their vows. This is not a seasonal campaign but a sustained effort that \nmay require years of service. \nArticle V: Indulgences and Privileges \nTO ALL WHO TAKE THE CROSS in this holy Crusade, we grant the following spiritual benefits and temporal \nprotections: \nSpiritual Benefits: \nl. Plenary Indulgence: Full remission of temporal punishment due for all Sins properly confessed with sincere \ncontrition. T his indulgence applies both to those who serve personally in the crusading army and to those who \nsupport the Crusade financially according to their means. \n2. Remission of Penances: All ecclesiastical penances imposed for past Sins are remitted for those who serve \nfaithfully in this Crusade. \n3. Special Intercession: Daily prayers shall be offered in churches throughout Christendom for the success of this \nCrusade and for the souls of crusaders living and dead. \n4. Martyrdom: Those who die in the service ofthis Crusade, having confessed their Sins and received the \nsacraments, shall be accounted as martyrs for the faith, and We have every confidence that God shall receive their \nsouls with mercy. \nTemporal Protections: \nl. Protection of Property: All property, lands, and goods of crusaders are placed under the protection of Iloly \nChurch for the duration of their service. Any who unjustly seize crusader property during their absence shall be \nexcommunicated. \n2. Suspension of Debts: Interest on debts owed by crusaders shall not accrue during their service. Creditors may not \nforeclose on crusader property during their absence. \n3. Legal Immunity: Legal proceedings against crusaders are suspended for the duration of their service, save for the \nmost serious crimes against God and man. \n4. Safe Conduct: Crusaders traveling to and from the campaign are granted safe conduct through all Christian lands. \nThose who harm or impede crusaders in their travels shall face ecclesiastical censure. \nArticle VI: Crusade Taxation \nTo provide the necessary resources for this sacred undertaking, WE DO AUTHORIZE the following taxation: \nl. Church Revenues: All ecclesiastical properties, monasteries, bishoprics, and church foundations within the \nKingdom of Castile shall contribute one-tenth of their annual revenues to the Crusade for its duration. \n2. Sale of Indulgences: Indulgences may be purchased by those unable to serve personally, with all proceeds directed \nto the Crusade treasury. These indulgences shall be sold at fair rates determined by the Papal Legate in \nconsultation with the Supreme Commander. \n3. Special Tithes: The Supreme Commander may, with the approval of the Papal Legate, levy additional tithes on the \nrealm as necessary to sustain the campaign, provided such taxation is not oppressive and is applied justly. \n4. Foreign Contributions: We call upon the faithful throughout Christendom to contribute financially to this \nCrusade. Collection boxes shall be placed in churches, and special appeals made for donations. \nAll funds raised for this Crusade must be used for its stated purposes: military operations, supplies, payment of \nsoldiers, care of wounded, and related expenses. Any who embezzle or misuse crusade funds shall be excommunicated \nand prosecuted to the fullest extent of canon law. \nArticle VII: Papal Legate and Spiritual Oversight \nTo ensure that this Crusade remains tme to its spiritual purposes and is conducted in accordance with Church teaching \nand canon law, WE SHALL AP POINT a Papal Legate to accompany the crusading forces. \nThe duties of the Papal Legate include: \n1. Spiritual Guidance: Ensuring that the crusading army maintains proper spiritual discipline, receives regular \nsacraments, and conducts itself in a manner befitting soldiers of Christ. \n2. Prevention of Excesses: Monitoring military operations to prevent unnecessary cruelty, forced conversions at \nsword-point, desecration of holy places (even Muslim ones that may contain sacred objects), and other acts \ncontrary to Church teaching. \n3. Pastoral Care: Hearing confessions, celebrating Mass, administering sacraments, providing spiritual counsel to \ncrusaders, and attending to the spiritual needs of the army. \n4. Judgment of Spiritual Matters: Deciding questions of canon law, determining whether military actions comply \nwith Church teaching on just war, and resolving disputes involving ecclesiastical jurisdiction. \n5. Communication with Rome: Reporting regularly to the Apostolic See on the progress of the Crusade, the conduct \nof forces, and any matters requiring papal attention. \nThe Legate has no military command and may not override the Supreme Commander's decisions regarding military \noperations, strategy, or tactics. However, ifthe Legate believes a proposed action violates Church teaching or canon law, \nhe must voice his concerns and may appeal to Us for guidance. \nThe Supreme Commander and the Papal Legate are to work in cooperation, each respecting the other's sphere of \nauthority. The military serves the spiritual purpose; the spiritual guides the military conduct. \nArticle VIII: Treatment of Granada and lts People \nThis Crusade is undertaken for the conversion of souls and the recovery of Christian territory, not for vengeance or \nworldly conquest alone. Therefore: \nl. Offer of Peaceful Conversion: Before military action, the rulers of Granada should be offered terms: Accept \nChristian baptism, submit to Castilian sovereignty, and receive protection of life and property. Those who convert \nwillingly shall be welcomed as brothers in Christ. \n2. Protection of Converts: Any Muslim who accepts baptism, whether before or during the conquest, shall receive \nfull protection of person, family, and reasonable property. Forced conversion at sword-point is forbidden. \nConversion must be of the heart, even if circumstances encourage it. \n3. Treatment of the Conquered: When cities or fortresses are taken, unnecessary slaughter is forbidden. Women, \nchildren, the elderly, and non-combatants should be protected from harm. The laws of war as understood by \nChurch teaching must be observed. \n4. Disposition of Property: Conquered lands become the property of the Crown of Castile to be distributed as the \nKing deems appropriate. However, properties of churches, monasteries, and religious foundations (even if \ncurrently Muslim) should be preserved where possible for conversion to Christian use. \n5. The Ultimate Goal: The goal is not to create a realm of resentful false converts, but to bring the light of Christ to \nGranada through a combination of military necessity, political wisdom, and genuine evangelization. The sword \nopens the door; the Gospel must enter through it. \nArticle IX: Vatican Support \nFrom the resources 0f the Apostolic see, WE DO PROVIDE: \nl. Financial Support: Twenty thousand florins from the papal treasury as immediate seed funding for this Crusade. \n2. Sacred Relics: A fragment of the True Cross and a bone of Saint James (Santiago) himself, to be carried with the \ncrusading army as signs of divine favor and protection. \n3. Letters to Christian Monarchs: We shall write to the kings of France, England, Portugal, Aragon, Navarre, and \nother Christian realms, endorsing this Crusade and requesting their support or at minimum their non-interference. \n4. Diplomatic Pressure: We shall communicate with King Alfonso V of Aragon, making clear that the Church \nexpects the Crown of Aragon to support, not hinder, this holy work. The Infantes de Aragon residing in Castile \nshould align themselves with this Crusade rather than pursuing factional interests. \n5. Prayers and Masses: Special prayers for the success ofthis Crusade shall be said throughout Christendom. We \nOurselves shall continue to pray daily for King Juan and for the conversion of Granada. \nArticle X: Duration and Conclusion \nThis Crusade is declared until the Kingdom of Granada is fully conquered and its conversion to Christianity is \nsecured, or until We or Our successors determine that the objective has been achieved or should be modified. \nVictory shall be marked by: \nThe fall of Granada's capital and submission of its rulers \nThe conversion of its mosques to churches \nThe establishment of Christian governance throughout the territory \nA population either converted to Christianity or living peacefully under Christian rule \nThe celebration of a Te Deum in the Great Mosque of Granada, rededicated as a cathedral \nUpon achieving these goals, the Supreme Commander may petition Us or Our successor for formal conclusion of the \nCrusade and release of all crusading vows. \nConclusion and Exhortation \nWe have witnessed in Our own presence a young king who offered everything - crown, wealth, even the very clothes \nupon his back - in service to God. This act of profound humility and complete submission moves Us to grant this bull \nwith confidence that it shall be used not for worldly ambition but for God's glory. \nTo Juan, King of Castile: Remember always the moment you knelt before Us. Let the inscription on your father's sword \nguide you: Non Nobis Domine - Not unto us, O Lord. Victory, if it comes, belongs to God alone. \nTo all who participate: You are soldiers of Christ, not mere warriors seeking plunder. Fight with courage but also with \nmercy. Be as fierce as lions against God's enemies, but as gentle as lambs toward those who seek baptism and peace. \nTo the faithful everywhere: Support this holy work with your prayers, your alms, and your service. The Reconquista, \nbegun centuries ago, may in our time be completed. That would be a blessing beyond measure. \nMay Almighty God, in whose name this Crusade is undertaken, grant victory to Christian arms, conversion to Muslim \nhearts, and glory to His holy name. \nGiven at Rome, at Saint Peter's, in the year of the Incarnation of Our Lord one thousand four hundred and thirty, \non the first day of August, in the thirteenth year of Our Pontificate. \nAttestation \nWe, Martin, by Divine Providence Pope, have signed this bull with Our own hand and ordered that it be sealed \nwith the Fisherman's Ring and the leaden seal of the Apostolic See. \nWitnessed by: \nGiordano Cardinal Orsini, Cardinal-Deacon of San Giorgio in Velabro \n• Paolo Caraffa, Chamberlain of the Apostolic Palace \n• Multiple other curial officials \n[SPACE FOR PAPAL SEALI \nThe great leaden seal (bulla) of Pope Martin V, bearing on one side the images of Saints Peter and Paul, and on the \nother the Pope's name, is affixed here by red and yellow Silk cords. \nAddendum: Special Provisions \nRegarding the White Garments: We note and bless King Juan's intention to wear white garments as symbol of his \nrenunciation and service. Let these garments remain unstained by pride but bear honestly the stains of service - mud, \nblood, and dust of the campaign. T his is fitting and proper. \nRegarding Future Correspondence: King Juan may write to Us at any time seeking guidance, reporting progress, or \nrequesting interpretation of this bull's provisions. We remain his father in Christ, ready to counsel and support him. \nRegarding Modifications: Should circumstances require modification of these terms, such changes may be made only \nby Us or Our successors, after consultation with the Supreme Commander and the Papal Legate. \nDeo Gratias \nEND OF BULL",

      "full_text": "PAPAL DECREE OF POPE EUGENIUS IV\nFidei Defensio et Corona Triumphans\n\"Defense of the Faith and the Triumphant Crown\"\n\nIssued at Rome, in the Palace of St. Peter  \nThe Twenty-Fourth Day of April, in the Year of Our Lord 1433  \nIn the Third Year of Our Pontificate\n\nEUGENIUS, BISHOP, SERVANT OF THE SERVANTS OF GOD\n\nTo all the faithful of Christ who shall read or hear these present letters, greeting and apostolic benediction.\n\nPREAMBLE\n\nWHEREAS the designs of Divine Providence are made manifest in the deeds of faithful princes who serve Christ with pure hearts and humble submission to Holy Mother Church;\n\nAND WHEREAS our beloved son in Christ, Juan II, by the Grace of God King of Castile and León, having received from our venerable predecessor Pope Martin V of blessed memory a crusade bull entitled Inter Cetera Divinae in the year of Our Lord 1430;\n\nAND WHEREAS the said King Juan, with exemplary fidelity and unwavering devotion to the Holy See, has accomplished that which seven centuries of Christian princes attempted but could not complete - namely, the reconquest of the lands held by the infidel Moors and the restoration of the Emirate of Granada to Christian rule;\n\nAND WHEREAS this same King has returned to Rome bearing the sacred relics entrusted to him - the fragment of the True Cross upon which Our Savior suffered, and the blessed bone of Saint James the Apostle - together with the crusade treasury complete and accounted for with scrupulous honesty;\n\nAND WHEREAS his fidelity to papal authority, his purity of faith, and his completion of the holy crusade stand as testimony to all Christian princes of what can be accomplished when royal power submits to apostolic guidance;\n\nNOW THEREFORE, We, Eugenius IV, Supreme Pontiff of the Holy Roman Church, by the authority of Almighty God, the Blessed Apostles Peter and Paul, and our own, do hereby decree and proclaim the following to be observed by all the faithful:\n\nARTICLE THE FIRST\nRelease from Crusade Oath with Highest Honors\n\nBE IT KNOWN that His Majesty King Juan II of Castile is hereby released from his crusade oath with the highest honors that the Church can bestow upon a Christian monarch. His service to Christ and His Church stands complete, perfected, and accomplished beyond all expectation.\n\nLet it be proclaimed throughout Christendom that the Reconquista, which began at Covadonga in the year 722, is now finished. The seven hundred and ten years of struggle end in glory. Granada is Christian. The infidel power in Iberia is broken. The cross of Christ flies where once the crescent stood.\n\nThis was accomplished under papal authority, through crusade bull lawfully granted and faithfully executed. Let all Christian kings observe: when royal power submits to apostolic guidance with pure faith and humble obedience, God grants victory.\n\nARTICLE THE SECOND\nPerpetual Grant of the Military Orders\n\nBY VIRTUE of the apostolic authority vested in Us, and in recognition of the extraordinary service rendered to Christendom by the completion of the Reconquista, We do hereby grant to His Majesty King Juan II of Castile, and to all his legitimate successors on the throne of Castile, perpetual and permanent control over the Military Orders of Santiago, Calatrava, and Alcántara.\n\nThis grant is made in perpetuity and shall bind all future Successors of Peter. No pope may revoke this grant. The Military Orders, having served faithfully in the completion of the Reconquista, shall henceforth serve under royal authority as befits the realm that completed God's work in Iberia.\n\nThe Masters of these Orders shall be appointed by the Crown of Castile. Their revenues, their fortresses, their knights, and all their properties shall be administered under royal direction for the defense of Christendom and the continued crusading mission that the completion of the Reconquista now makes possible beyond Iberia's shores.\n\nLet this be recorded in perpetuity: The crown that finished the Reconquista governs the Orders that fought for it.\n\nARTICLE THE THIRD\nSupport for the Kingdom of Naples\n\nWE DO HEREBY proclaim our support for the just claim of our beloved son in Christ, Alfonso V, by the Grace of God King of Aragón, Sicily, Valencia, and Sardinia, to the Kingdom of Naples against all challengers.\n\nThe claim of King Alfonso is founded in justice and legitimacy. We reject and declare invalid any competing claims that contradict the lawful rights of the Crown of Aragón to said kingdom.\n\nWe shall write to all Christian monarchs explaining the justice of this claim and urging their recognition and support. We call upon all faithful princes to support King Alfonso's lawful right to Naples and to reject the claims of those who would dispute his inheritance.\n\nThis support is given in recognition of the alliance between Castile and Aragón, both of which have served the Church faithfully, and in acknowledgment that the consolidation of Christian power in the Mediterranean serves the greater cause of defending Christendom against the Turkish threat.\n\nARTICLE THE FOURTH\nApostolic Confidence in the King's Mission\n\nBE IT KNOWN that when His Majesty King Juan II travels to the Council of Basel to witness its proceedings and to address the assembled fathers, he does so with Our apostolic blessing and carries Our complete confidence.\n\nHis delegation to Basel has argued matters of theology and church reform with wisdom, distinguishing themselves by their commitment to genuine reform while maintaining fidelity to apostolic authority. Their contribution to the Council's deliberations has been noted and valued.\n\nWhen His Majesty himself attends the Council, let all present understand that he speaks not merely as a foreign monarch but as one whom God has manifestly blessed through the completion of the Reconquista. His witness to what papal authority can accomplish when exercised righteously and obeyed faithfully is testimony that the Council fathers must hear.\n\nWe do not send him to command the Council - for councils have their proper authority in matters of reform and doctrine. Rather, We send him to remind the assembled fathers what their debates truly concern: not the mere distribution of power between pope and council, but the salvation of souls and the defense of Christendom.\n\nARTICLE THE FIFTH\nAlliance of Faith Between Rome and Castile\n\nFINALLY, let it be known throughout Christendom that We have formed an alliance with the Crown of Castile, founded not in temporal politics but in shared faith and common devotion to the defense of Holy Mother Church.\n\nFor three years We have labored under great burdens - theological disputes with the Council of Basel, military threats to the Papal States, divisions within Rome itself. In this hour of trial, God has sent us an ally whose faithfulness to the Church is proven not by words but by deeds.\n\nThe completion of the Reconquista under papal authority stands as answer to those who claim papal authority has failed, that councils must be supreme over popes, that the Church can no longer accomplish great works. Granada proves otherwise.\n\nCastile stands with Rome. Rome stands with Castile. This alliance is forged in faith, strengthened by shared devotion to Christ, and dedicated to the defense and reform of the Church that both pope and faithful king love and serve.\n\nLet all who threaten the Church understand: Castile's swords defend not merely Iberian territory but the very institution of Christ's Church. Let all who seek authentic reform understand: Castile's example shows that reform need not come through rebellion against apostolic authority but through faithful cooperation with it.\n\nPROMULGATION AND EXECUTION\n\nTHESE DECREES are promulgated this day with the full authority of the Apostolic See. They are to be published throughout Christendom, recorded in the archives of the Holy See, and observed by all the faithful.\n\nWe command that copies of this decree be sent to all Christian monarchs, to the Council of Basel, to all archbishops and bishops, and to all cathedral chapters and monasteries, that all may know what God has accomplished through the faithful service of King Juan II of Castile.\n\nWe further decree that this document shall be sealed with the Fisherman's Ring and attested by the signatures of the cardinals present at its promulgation, that all may know it carries the full weight of apostolic authority.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nLET THE BELLS of Christendom ring in thanksgiving for the completion of the Reconquista. Let prayers of gratitude rise to Heaven for the victory God has granted. Let all Christian princes learn from the example of Castile what can be accomplished when royal power submits to apostolic guidance with pure faith.\n\nAnd let all who labor for the reform and defense of Holy Mother Church take heart: God has not abandoned His Church. The completion of seven centuries of crusade proves that when We act with pure faith and humble submission to Divine Will, God grants victory.\n\nDeus Vult. Christus Vincit. Christus Regnat. Christus Imperat.\n\nGiven at Rome, at St. Peter's, under the Fisherman's Ring, the twenty-fourth day of April, in the year of the Incarnation of Our Lord one thousand four hundred and thirty-three, in the third year of Our Pontificate.\n\nATTESTATIONS\n\n+ EUGENIUS PP.

      "full_text": "THE DECLARATION OF COMO\nOn the Unity and Reform of Holy Mother Church\n\nSigned at Como, in the Duchy of Milan\nThe 7th day of June, in the Year of Our Lord 1433\n\nDECLARATIO CONIUNCTA\n\nOf His Imperial Majesty Sigismund, by the Grace of God King of the Romans, Ever Augustus, King of Hungary, Bohemia, Dalmatia, Croatia, etc., and His Most Christian Majesty Juan II, by the Grace of God King of Castile, León, Toledo, Galicia, Seville, Córdoba, Murcia, Jaén, the Algarve, Algeciras, Gibraltar, and Lord of Vizcaya and Molina\n\nIN NOMINE DOMINI. AMEN.\n\nWe, Sigismund and Juan, servants of Christ and guardians of Christian peoples, speaking with one voice and one purpose, do hereby declare our common position on matters touching the unity and reform of Holy Mother Church.\n\nWe speak not as adversaries of the Holy Father, nor as partisans of any faction, but as Christian rulers who bear solemn responsibility before God for the souls entrusted to our care. We have witnessed with great sorrow the divisions that afflict the Body of Christ. We have seen Pope and Council set against one another while the enemies of the Faith press upon our borders. We have watched heresy flourish where corruption has sown its seeds.\n\nWe declare that this cannot continue.\n\nThe unity of the Church is not a matter for factional victory. It is the foundation upon which all Christendom rests. Without unity, there can be no crusade against the Ottoman. Without reform, there can be no reconciliation with those who have strayed. Without both unity and reform together, the Church our Lord founded upon the rock of Peter shall be broken against the rocks of pride and greed.\n\nTherefore, we set forth our position on these matters:\n\nARTICLE I: On the Reform of Pluralism and Absenteeism\n\nWe support fully the decrees of the Sacred Council of Basel regarding the holding of multiple benefices. The practice whereby a single cleric holds three, four, or more bishoprics—visiting none, caring for none, collecting revenue from all—is an offense against God and a scandal to the faithful.\n\nWe declare: One man shall hold one major benefice, exceptions to be granted only by papal dispensation for genuine pastoral necessity, not for the enrichment of the already wealthy.\n\nARTICLE II: On the Reform of Episcopal Elections\n\nWe support the restoration of genuine electoral rights to cathedral chapters, ending the abuse of papal provisions and reservations whereby the Holy See appoints bishops directly, bypassing those who know best the needs of their churches.\n\nWe declare: Cathedral chapters shall elect their bishops freely, with Rome confirming those canonically elected. The ancient practice of provision and reservation shall be curtailed except in cases of genuine necessity.\n\nFurthermore: We acknowledge that certain episcopal sees—most notably the archbishoprics of Mainz, Trier, and Cologne within the Holy Roman Empire—carry responsibilities beyond the purely spiritual. These prince-electors hold offices essential to the governance of Christian peoples. Candidates for such positions should demonstrate qualifications for both their spiritual duties and their temporal functions, in accordance with privileges confirmed at the Council of Constance and ancient custom. This recognition of dual responsibility shall not diminish the reform of elections, but shall acknowledge the reality of these unique offices.\n\nARTICLE III: On the Reform of Annates and Papal Taxation\n\nWe acknowledge that the Holy See requires revenue to fulfill its sacred mission. We do not seek to impoverish Rome, but to end the abuses that have made papal taxation a byword for corruption throughout Christendom.\n\nWe declare: Annates shall not exceed one-quarter of the first year's revenue of any benefice. This cap shall be absolute and shall apply to all payments made upon receiving ecclesiastical office.\n\nFurthermore: The Apostolic Camera shall retain authority for assessing the value of benefices, but shall exercise this authority with transparency and accountability. Valuations shall be published and made available to those assessed. Any cleric who believes his benefice has been unfairly valued shall have right of appeal to a neutral body. Assessments shall be reviewed at regular intervals to ensure they reflect true values, not arbitrary impositions.\n\nARTICLE IV: On Institutional Accountability\n\nThe Church, like all institutions of men, is subject to the corruption that flows from human sin. Where corruption takes root, it must be exposed and corrected. Yet who shall correct the correctors? Who shall hold accountable those who hold others accountable?\n\nWe declare: There shall be established a standing commission for the oversight of Church institutions, appointed jointly by the Holy Father and the Sacred Council during sessions of the Council, and continuing its work between sessions. This commission shall have authority to investigate complaints of corruption, to audit the practices of Church offices including the Apostolic Camera, and to publish its findings for all Christendom to see.\n\nThis commission shall not possess authority to dismiss the Holy Father or to overrule papal decisions. It shall not claim supremacy over any office of the Church. Its power shall be the power of sunlight—to expose what is hidden, to name what is corrupt, to document what has been denied. Let shame accomplish what legal authority cannot, until such time as the Church is prepared for stronger medicine.\n\nARTICLE V: On the Reconciliation of Bohemia\n\nFor thirty-five years, Christian has slain Christian in the lands of Bohemia. Five crusades have failed. Tens of thousands have perished. And still the war continues, draining the strength of Christendom while the Ottoman masses his forces in the East.\n\nWe declare: This war must end. Not through the extermination of the Bohemian people, but through genuine reconciliation.\n\nThe moderate Hussites—those called Utraquists—seek not to destroy the Church but to reform it. Their central demand, communion under both kinds for the laity, touches no essential doctrine. The Council of Constance declared that Christ is entirely present in the bread alone; the granting of the cup to the laity therefore deprives them of nothing they do not already receive.\n\nWe support the negotiations presently underway at Basel to grant communion in both kinds to the faithful of Bohemia and Moravia, as a pastoral accommodation that preserves doctrine while ending bloodshed. We call upon all parties to embrace this reconciliation in good faith, that the wound in the Body of Christ may finally be healed.\n\nARTICLE VI: On Our Common Commitment\n\nWe, Sigismund and Juan, do hereby pledge to coordinate our efforts in support of these reforms. We shall encourage their adoption by all Christian princes. We shall work toward Church unity through genuine reform rather than factional victory.\n\nWe take this position not from hostility to the Holy Father, whom we recognize as Vicar of Christ and head of the Church on earth, but from the conviction that unity without reform is impossible, and reform without unity is meaningless.\n\nThe alternative to reform is schism. The alternative to unity is the destruction of everything our ancestors built and bled to defend. We cannot accept these alternatives. We will not accept them.\n\nTherefore let it be known: The Emperor of the Romans and the King of Castile stand together in this cause. We speak with one voice. We shall not be divided. And we call upon all Christian rulers, all princes of the Church, and all faithful people to join us in demanding that the Church be reformed in head and members, that unity be preserved, and that Christendom be made ready to face the enemies who even now gather at our gates.\n\nGiven under our hands and seals at Como, in the Duchy of Milan, on this seventh day of June, in the year of Our Lord one thousand four hundred and thirty-three.\n\nSigismundus Dei Gratia Romanorum Rex semper Augustus, Hungariae, Bohemiae, Dalmatiae, Croatiae Rex\n\n[SEAL]\n\nIoannes Dei Gratia Rex Castellae, Legionis, Toleti, Galleciae, Hispalis, Cordubae, Murciae, Gienni, Algarbiae, Algecirae, Gibraltaris, ac Dominus Vizcaiae et Molinae\n\n[SEAL]\n\nWitnesses:\n\n- Fray Hernando de Talavera, O.F.M., Confessor to His Majesty of Castile\n- [Imperial Secretary]\n- [Archbishop of Como or representative]\n\nLETTER TO HIS HOLINESS POPE EUGENIUS IV\n\nFrom His Imperial Majesty Sigismund and His Most Christian Majesty Juan II\n\nGiven at Como, the 7th day of June, 1433\n\nTo the Most Holy Father in Christ, Eugenius IV, by Divine Providence Supreme Pontiff of the Universal Church, from his devoted sons Sigismund, King of the Romans, and Juan, King of Castile, greeting and filial obedience.\n\nMost Holy Father,\n\nWe write to Your Holiness jointly, a thing uncommon between rulers whose lands lie far apart, because the matter before us demands uncommon measures. The unity of Holy Mother Church—and with it the safety of all Christendom—stands in peril such as we have not seen since the dark days of the Great Schism.\n\nWe do not write as adversaries of Your Holiness. We write as sons of the Church who see our mother bleeding from wounds inflicted by her own children. We write as rulers who must answer to God for the souls in our care, and who cannot stand silent while the Body of Christ is torn asunder.\n\nMost Holy Father, we beg you to hear us.\n\nThe Sacred Council of Basel has passed decrees of genuine reform—reforms that address corruptions long acknowledged, abuses long lamented, scandals long deplored. These reforms touch pluralism, whereby single clerics hold multiple benefices while the faithful go unshepherded. They touch simony, whereby sacred offices are bought and sold like goods in a marketplace. They touch the taxation that has made Rome a byword for extraction rather than sanctity.\n\nWe know that Your Holiness has been locked in dispute with the Council over questions of authority. We know that the specter of Haec Sancta haunts these proceedings—the question of whether councils stand above popes or popes above councils. We know that Your Holiness fears that accepting conciliar reforms means accepting conciliar supremacy.\n\nWe propose another path.\n\nYour Holiness possesses full apostolic authority to reform the Church by your own decree. What the Council has passed, Your Holiness may pass independently—the same reforms, the same language, issued on your own initiative as Supreme Pontiff. In this way, the Church is reformed without any admission that councils may command popes. The substance is achieved; the principle is preserved.\n\nWe have enclosed with this letter a declaration of our common position on specific reforms. We ask Your Holiness to consider adopting these reforms by papal decree, demonstrating to all Christendom that the Holy Father leads the cause of reform rather than resisting it.\n\nWe ask this not as a demand, but as a plea.\n\nThe alternative is too terrible to contemplate. If Pope and Council cannot find common ground, schism becomes inevitable. Another generation of Christians killing Christians over who leads the Church while the Ottoman Sultan watches and waits. Another cycle of rival popes and competing obediences while heresy spreads unchecked.\n\nHis Majesty of Castile intends to visit Your Holiness in Rome following the safe delivery of his queen. He wishes to discuss these matters personally, to offer whatever assistance Castile can provide, and to demonstrate his devotion to Your Holiness and to the unity of the Church.\n\nUntil that happy day, we commend ourselves to Your Holiness's prayers and blessing. We remain, as ever, faithful sons of the Church and obedient servants of the Vicar of Christ.\n\nMay God guide Your Holiness in wisdom, and may the Holy Spirit bring peace to His Church.\n\nGiven under our hands at Como, the seventh day of June, in the year of Our Lord 1433.\n\nYour Holiness's devoted sons in Christ,\n\nSigismundus Rex Romanorum\n\nIoannes Rex Castellae\n\nLETTER TO THE CASTILIAN DELEGATION AT BASEL\n\nFrom His Most Christian Majesty Juan II, King of Castile\n\nGiven at Como, the 7th day of June, 1433\n\nTo our beloved and faithful servants Abbott Rodrigo González, Bishop Alfonso de Cartagena, and the members of our royal delegation at the Sacred Council of Basel, greeting.\n\nMy faithful friends,\n\nI write from Como, where by God's providence I have met with His Imperial Majesty Sigismund on his return from coronation in Rome. We have spoken at length—through an entire night—on the crisis facing the Church and on what we, as Christian rulers, might do to address it.\n\nI am pleased to report that we have reached full agreement.\n\nEnclosed with this letter you will find the Declaration of Como, a joint statement of our common position on Church reform, signed by both the Emperor and myself. You will also find a copy of our letter to His Holiness Pope Eugenius IV, which is being dispatched to Rome by imperial courier.\n\nYour instructions are as follows:\n\nFirst, make the Declaration known to Cardinal Cesarini and to our allies among the German moderates. The Emperor and I have committed to coordinating our efforts; our delegations should do the same. What the German delegation advocates, the Castilian delegation should support, and vice versa. We must present a united front.\n\nSecond, continue to advocate for the specific reforms outlined in the Declaration. These represent our firm position: limits on pluralism, restoration of chapter elections, caps on annates with Camera transparency, and the establishment of an oversight commission. On these matters, we do not bend.\n\nThird, support the ongoing negotiations with the Bohemian delegation regarding communion in both kinds. The Emperor has made clear that Utraquist reconciliation is essential to ending thirty-five years of bloodshed. Castile stands with the Empire on this matter. Those who oppose accommodation with the moderate Hussites oppose the Emperor and oppose us.\n\nFourth, regarding Haec Sancta and the question of papal versus conciliar supremacy—maintain our position of neutrality. We support reform. We support unity. We do not take sides in the constitutional dispute. Our hope is that successful cooperation on reform will make the constitutional question less urgent, allowing both Pope and Council to save face while accomplishing what matters.\n\nFifth, keep me informed. Write regularly. If circumstances change—if the French faction moves against our position, if Cardinal Aleman attempts to force a vote on papal deposition, if anything threatens the fragile progress we have made—I must know immediately.\n\nA personal word:\n\nFray Hernando returns with me to Castile and will accompany me on my subsequent journeys. Abbott Rodrigo and Bishop Alfonso, you bear the burden of representing Castile at Basel in my absence. I have complete confidence in your judgment and your faithfulness. The work you have done these eight months has earned Castile a reputation as a voice of reason in a council full of factions. Maintain that reputation. Build on it.\n\nThe Emperor departs for Basel within days. He will seek you out when he arrives. Receive him as you would receive me. We are allies now—more than allies. We are partners in a cause that transcends our individual kingdoms.\n\nGod grant you wisdom and strength. I will see you again when circumstances permit.\n\nGiven under my hand at Como, the seventh day of June, in the year of Our Lord 1433.\n\nYour king and friend,\n\nJuan\n\nPost Scriptum: The seventeen crusaders who departed with the Byzantine delegation carry my blessing and my prayers. If word reaches Basel of their progress toward Constantinople, send it to me in Castile immediately. And tell the Greeks, if any remain at Basel, that Castile has not forgotten them. The thousand knights and sixty thousand florins are being assembled even now.\n\n[END OF DOCUMENTS]\n\nDrafted by Fray Hernando de Talavera, O.F.M.\nComo, June 6-7, 1433",

Unde scriptum est: \"Si dominus non aedificaverit domum, in vanum laboraverunt qui aedificant eam.\"\n\nConsiderantes igitur, quod multae et gravissimae corruptelae in ecclesia Dei provenerunt ex pravis electionibus et indebitis provisionibus ad ecclesias cathedrales, metropolitanas, collegiatas et monasteria, per quas personae indignae et inhonestae ad regimen animarum assumebantur;\n\nEt attendentes, quod haec mala maxime ex duabus causis processerunt: primo, ex generali reservatione, qua Romani pontifices sibi ipsis provisiones ad praedictas ecclesias reservaverunt; secundo, ex simoniacae pravitatis crimine, quo electiones et provisiones infectae fuerunt;\n\nVolens igitur haec sancta synodus talibus malis providere et ecclesiam Dei in meliorato statu conservare, praesentem legem perpetuo valiturarn statuit et decernit:\n\nEnglish Translation\n\nJust as in building a house the architect's chief concern is to lay such a foundation that the edifice built on it will endure immovable, so in the general reformation of the church the principal preoccupation of this holy synod is that the pastors set over the church may be such that, like pillars and bases, they will firmly uphold the church by the strength of their doctrine and merits.\n\nFor just as a house built on sand easily falls, so a church established under unworthy pastors is soon corrupted. Whence it is written: \"Unless the Lord builds the house, in vain do they labor who build it.\"\n\nConsidering therefore that many and most serious corruptions in God's church have arisen from wicked elections and undue provisions to cathedral, metropolitan, collegiate churches and monasteries, by which unworthy and dishonest persons were assumed to the government of souls;\n\nAnd noting that these evils proceeded chiefly from two causes: first, from the general reservation by which Roman pontiffs reserved to themselves provisions to the aforesaid churches; second, from the crime of simoniacal depravity by which elections and provisions were infected;\n\nWilling therefore to provide for such evils and to preserve God's church in an improved state, this holy synod establishes and decrees the present law to be valid in perpetuity:\n\nPART III: NARRATIO - HISTORICAL CIRCUMSTANCES\n\nLatin Text\n\nCum olim per sacrorum canonum instituta, electiones ad ecclesias cathedrales et metropolitanas, necnon ad monasteria et ecclesias collegiatas, pertinebant ad capitula et conventus earundem ecclesiarum et monasteriorum, ita ut canonice et libere possent personas idoneas eligere;\n\nSed procedente tempore, diversos abusus inoleverunt: primo, per reservationes generales a Romanis pontificibus factas, quibus ius electionis fere totaliter sublatum fuit; secundo, per simoniaca commercia, quibus dignitates ecclesiasticae venduntur et emuntur quasi res venales in foro;\n\nConstat autem, quod per tales reservationes et corruptelas, ecclesia Dei graviter laesa est: nam personae indignae ad regimen animarum pervenunt, qui nec scientiam habent ad docendum, nec vitam ad exemplum praestandum, nec zelum ad animarum salutem procurandam;\n\nPraeterea, per huiusmodi abusus, libertas ecclesiastica oppressa est, et capitula atque conventus a suo iure electoris fraudata sunt, contra antiquam ecclesiae consuetudinem et sacrorum canonum auctoritatem;\n\nPorro, experientia docuit, quod personae per electionem canonicam assumptae, meliores pastores fuerunt quam illae quae per provisionem apostolicam vel per simoniaca suffragia ad praelationem pervenerunt;\n\nIdeo haec sancta synodus, auctoritate dei omnipotentis et beatorum apostolorum Petri et Pauli et sua, revocat omnes reservationes generales hactenus factas, et libertatem electionis capitulis et conventibus restituit, prout in sequentibus plenius declarabitur.\n\nEnglish Translation\n\nWhereas of old, by the institution of the sacred canons, elections to cathedral and metropolitan churches, as well as to monasteries and collegiate churches, belonged to the chapters and convents of the same churches and monasteries, so that they could canonically and freely elect suitable persons;\n\nBut as time proceeded, various abuses grew up: first, through general reservations made by Roman pontiffs, by which the right of election was almost totally taken away; second, through simoniacal transactions, by which ecclesiastical dignities are sold and bought like vendible things in the marketplace;\n\nIt is established moreover that through such reservations and corruptions, God's church has been gravely injured: for unworthy persons attain to the government of souls, who have neither knowledge for teaching, nor life for giving example, nor zeal for procuring the salvation of souls;\n\nFurthermore, through such abuses, ecclesiastical liberty has been oppressed, and chapters and convents have been defrauded of their right to elect, contrary to the ancient custom of the church and the authority of the sacred canons;\n\nMoreover, experience has taught that persons assumed through canonical election have been better pastors than those who attained to prelacy through apostolic provision or through simoniacal votes;\n\nTherefore this holy synod, by the authority of almighty God and of the blessed apostles Peter and Paul and its own, revokes all general reservations hitherto made, and restores the liberty of election to chapters and convents, as will be more fully declared in what follows.\n\nPART IV: DISPOSITIO - LEGAL PROVISIONS\n\nSECTION A: ABOLITION OF RESERVATIONS\n\nLatin Text\n\nArticulus Primus: De Revocatione Reservationum\n\nHaec sancta synodus, reformationem ecclesiae principaliter intendens, statuit et decernit: quod omnes et singulae reservationes generales hactenus factae de ecclesiis metropolitanis, cathedralibus, monasteriis et ecclesiis collegiatis, quotcumque fuerunt et qualitercumque factae, penitus revocantur et cassantur, ac pro revocatis et cassatis habeantur.\n\nDeclarans expresse, quod huiusmodi reservationes nullam vim habent nec habebunt in futurum, et quod nullus, cuiuscumque dignitatis aut status existat, etiam si Romanus pontifex sit, poterit contra hanc revocationem aliquid attemptare, nisi hoc idem concilium generale aliud duxerit statuendum.\n\nIus ergo electionis, quod per huiusmodi reservationes capitula et conventus amiserant, eis integre et plene restituitur, ita ut libere et canonice possint procedere ad electionem personarum idonearum, secundum formam in hoc decreto contentam.\n\nEnglish Translation\n\nArticle One: On the Revocation of Reservations\n\nThis holy synod, principally intending the reformation of the church, establishes and decrees that all and singular general reservations hitherto made concerning metropolitan, cathedral churches, monasteries and collegiate churches, howsoever many and in whatever manner made, are entirely revoked and annulled, and are to be held as revoked and annulled.\n\nDeclaring expressly that such reservations have no force nor shall have any in the future, and that no one, of whatever dignity or estate he may be, even if he be the Roman pontiff, shall be able to attempt anything contrary to this revocation, unless this same general council shall have decided to establish otherwise.\n\nTherefore the right of election, which chapters and convents had lost through such reservations, is restored to them fully and completely, so that they may freely and canonically proceed to the election of suitable persons, according to the form contained in this decree.\n\nSECTION B: THE THREE-STAGE ELECTORAL PROCESS\n\nLatin Text\n\nArticulus Secundus: De Modo Procedendi in Electionibus\n\nAd removendum omnem occasionem erroris et pravitatis in futuris electionibus, haec sancta synodus statuit et ordinat, quod omnes electiones ad ecclesias metropolitanas, cathedrales, monasteria et collegiatas, fiant secundum modum infrascriptum, sub poena nullitatis et aliis poenis inferius expressis.\n\nPrimus Gradus: De Praeparatione Spirituali\n\nQuando sedes alicuius ecclesiae cathedralis vel metropolitanae, aut praelatio alicuius monasterii vel ecclesiae collegiatae vacat, capitulum vel conventus, intra mensem a die vacationis computandum, debet procedere ad electionem.\n\nIn die autem electionis, antequam ad ipsum actum procedatur, omnes electores tenentur:\n\nPrimo, interesse missae de Spiritu Sancto, quae solemniter celebrari debet in ecclesia capitulari vel monastica, cum hymno \"Veni Creator Spiritus\" et collecta \"Deus qui corda fidelium.\"\n\nSecundo, confiteri peccata sua proprio confessario et recipere absolutionem sacramentalem, nisi aliud iustum impedimentum obstiterit.\n\nTertio, suscipere sacram communionem in eadem missa, ut purificati et fortificati divina gratia, possint libere et digne procedere ad electionem.\n\nEt si aliquis elector praedictis non communicaverit, nisi ex legitima causa, pro illa vice amittet vocem activam in electione, et votum eius nullius erit momenti.\n\nSecundus Gradus: De Sacramento contra Simoniam\n\nPost missam celebratam et communionem perceptam, omnes electores, singuli et in solidum, coram altari ecclesiae, tactis sacris evangeliis, praestabunt sequens sacramentum:\n\n\"Ego, N., iuro et promitto Deo omnipotenti et sancto N. (secundum ecclesiae dedicationem) quod eligam illam personam quam credo magis utilem fore ecclesiae in spiritualibus et temporalibus, et non dabo vocem meam alicui quem puto procurare sibi electionem per promissionem aut donationem alicuius temporalis rei, vel per rogationem factam per se vel per alium, vel aliquo alio modo directe vel indirecte.\n\nItem iuro, quod non recepi nec recipiam, nec mihi promitti feci, aliquid temporale vel spirituale, occasione huius electionis, a quocumque candidato vel ab aliquo pro eo.\n\nItem iuro, quod in hac electione attendam solummodo honorem Dei, utilitatem ecclesiae, et salutem animarum, non favorem personarum, non propinquitatem sanguinis, non munerum largitionem, non timorem potentium, sed solam conscientiarn meam et dictamen rectae rationis.\n\nSic me Deus adiuvet et haec sancta Dei evangelia.\"\n\nQuod sacramentum omnes et singuli praestare tenentur, sub poena excommunicationis latae sententiae ipso facto incurrendae, et privationis vocis activae in perpetuum.\n\nTertius Gradus: De Qualitate Eligendorum\n\nPostquam omnes electores praedictum sacramentum praestiterint, tunc et non prius, possunt procedere ad electionem, observando quod sequitur:\n\nEligenda est persona quae sit:\n\nPrimo, legitimae aetatis secundum canones, id est, triginta annorum completa ad minus pro episcopatu, viginti quinque pro abbatia vel praepositura maiori.\n\nSecundo, probatae honestatis et bonae famae, ita quod nullum scandalum publicum de ipsa constet.\n\nTertio, congruae litteraturae et scientiae, scilicet quod habeat saltem graduum in theologia vel in iure canonico, aut alioquin per experientiam sit erudita in his quae ad regimen animarum pertinent.\n\nQuarto, in sacris ordinibus iam constituta, vel saltem subdiaconatus ordinem habens, qui infra annum post electionem teneatur ad sacerdotium promoveri.\n\nQuinto, alioquin idonea secundum canonicas sanctiones, ut ad animarum regimen assumi possit sine periculo.\n\nNec liceat eligere aliquem qui sit:\n\nPrimo, notorie infamis propter aliquod crimen, maxime haeresis, symonie, homicidii vel luxuriae.\n\nSecundo, irregularis secundum canones, nisi de ipsa irregularitate fuerit dispensatum.\n\nTertio, excommunicatus vel suspensus vel interdicto subiectus.\n\nQuarto, mentis compos non sit, vel alio morbo perpetuo laborans, quo ecclesiae regimini inutilis redderetur.\n\nEnglish Translation\n\nArticle Two: On the Manner of Proceeding in Elections\n\nTo remove every occasion of error and wickedness in future elections, this holy synod establishes and ordains that all elections to metropolitan, cathedral churches, monasteries and collegiate churches shall be made according to the manner written below, under penalty of nullity and other penalties expressed hereafter.\n\nFirst Stage: On Spiritual Preparation\n\nWhen the see of any cathedral or metropolitan church, or the prelacy of any monastery or collegiate church becomes vacant, the chapter or convent, within one month computed from the day of the vacancy, must proceed to election.\n\nOn the day of the election, before proceeding to the act itself, all electors are bound:\n\nFirst, to attend Mass of the Holy Spirit, which must be solemnly celebrated in the chapter or monastic church, with the hymn \"Come Creator Spirit\" and the collect \"God who teaches the hearts of the faithful.\"\n\nSecond, to confess their sins to their own confessor and receive sacramental absolution, unless some other just impediment should prevent it.\n\nThird, to receive holy communion in the same Mass, so that purified and strengthened by divine grace, they may freely and worthily proceed to the election.\n\nAnd if any elector shall not have communicated in the aforesaid manner, unless for a legitimate cause, he shall lose for that occasion the active voice in the election, and his vote shall be of no moment.\n\nSecond Stage: On the Oath Against Simony\n\nAfter the Mass has been celebrated and communion received, all electors, individually and jointly, before the altar of the church, touching the holy gospels, shall take the following oath:\n\n\"I, N., swear and promise to almighty God and to saint N. (according to the dedication of the church) that I will elect that person whom I believe will be more useful to the church in spiritual and temporal things, and I will not give my vote to anyone whom I think is procuring the election for himself by the promise or gift of some temporal thing, or by a request made by himself or through another, or in any other way directly or indirectly.\n\nLikewise I swear that I have not received nor shall I receive, nor have I caused to be promised to me, anything temporal or spiritual, on occasion of this election, from any candidate or from anyone for him.\n\nLikewise I swear that in this election I shall attend only to the honor of God, the utility of the church, and the salvation of souls, not favor of persons, not kinship of blood, not largesse of gifts, not fear of the powerful, but only my conscience and the dictate of right reason.\n\nSo help me God and these holy gospels of God.\"\n\nWhich oath all and each are bound to take, under penalty of excommunication of sentence already passed to be incurred by the very fact, and deprivation of active voice in perpetuity.\n\nThird Stage: On the Quality of Those to be Elected\n\nAfter all the electors have taken the aforesaid oath, then and not before, they may proceed to the election, observing what follows:\n\nThere must be elected a person who is:\n\nFirst, of legitimate age according to the canons, that is, at least thirty years completed for the episcopate, twenty-five for an abbacy or major provostship.\n\nSecond, of proven honesty and good reputation, so that no public scandal is established about him.\n\nThird, of suitable learning and knowledge, namely that he have at least a degree in theology or in canon law, or otherwise be learned by experience in those things which pertain to the government of souls.\n\nFourth, already established in sacred orders, or at least having the order of subdeacon, who within a year after election shall be bound to be promoted to the priesthood.\n\nFifth, otherwise suitable according to canonical sanctions, so that he may be assumed to the government of souls without danger.\n\nNor is it lawful to elect anyone who is:\n\nFirst, notoriously infamous for any crime, especially heresy, simony, homicide or lechery.\n\nSecond, irregular according to the canons, unless dispensation for such irregularity has been granted.\n\nThird, excommunicated or suspended or subject to interdict.\n\nFourth, not of sound mind, or laboring under some other perpetual disease, by which he would be rendered useless for the government of the church.\n\nSECTION C: VOTING PROCEDURES\n\nLatin Text\n\nArticulus Tertius: De Forma Votandi\n\nObservatis omnibus praemissis, electores procedant ad votandum secundum unum ex modis infrascriptis, prout maiori parti videbitur expedire:\n\nPrimus Modus: Per Scrutinium\n\nSi electio fiat per scrutinium, tres electores probatae fidei et conscientiae eligantur a capitulo vel conventu ad recipiendum suffragia et scrutanda.\n\nQui scrutatores, postquam sacramentum praestiterint de fideliter officio fungendo et secreto servando, vocabunt singulos electores sigillatim, et recipient ab eis schedulam scriptam vel vocem oretenus expressam, continentem nomen personae cui dant suffragium.\n\nQuolibet autem electore suffragium dante, scrutatores diligenter notabunt nomen eius et nomen personae electae, ita ut nullus possit negare quid fecerit.\n\nCompleto scrutinio, tres scrutatores coram omnibus publicabunt quot suffragia quaelibet persona receperit.\n\nEt si aliqua persona receperit duas partes ex omnibus suffragiis, vel saltem maiorem partem, declarabitur electa, et statim Te Deum laudamus solemniter cantabitur.\n\nSecundus Modus: Per Compromissum\n\nSi electores concorditer velint eligere per compromissum, possunt eligere tres vel quinque vel septem de capitulo vel conventu, discretos et probatae conscientiae, dando eis plenam potestatem eligendi aliquem de ipso capitulo vel de extra.\n\nQui compromissarii, acceptato onere, procedent ad electionem secundum formam superius prescriptam, scilicet cum sacramento et observatione qualitatum requisitarum.\n\nEt quem ipsi compromissarii elegerint, si duas partes eorum in eo convenerint, habeatur pro canonice electo.\n\nTertius Modus: Per Inspirationem\n\nSi vero, Spiritu Sancto inspirante, omnes unanimiter et concorditer, nemine penitus discrepante, in aliquam personam idoneam consenserint, ac voce proclamaverint: \"Eligimus N. in episcopum\" vel \"in abbatem,\" absque ulla praevia tractatione vel collatione habita, talis electio per inspirationem facta valebit, dummodo persona electa sit canonica et idonea, et omnes praedictum sacramentum praestiterint.\n\nSed quia huiusmodi modus valde rarus est, et de facili fingere posset, electores bene caveant ne sub praetextu inspirationis aliqua fraus vel colludio subintrare valeat.\n\nEnglish Translation\n\nArticle Three: On the Form of Voting\n\nAll the aforesaid being observed, the electors shall proceed to vote according to one of the modes written below, as shall seem expedient to the greater part:\n\nFirst Mode: By Scrutiny\n\nIf the election is made by scrutiny, three electors of proven faith and conscience shall be chosen by the chapter or convent to receive and scrutinize the votes.\n\nThese scrutineers, after they have taken an oath to faithfully perform their office and keep secrecy, shall call the individual electors one by one, and shall receive from them a written schedule or a voice expressed orally, containing the name of the person to whom they give their vote.\n\nWhen any elector gives his vote, the scrutineers shall diligently note his name and the name of the person elected, so that none may deny what he has done.\n\nThe scrutiny being completed, the three scrutineers shall publish before all how many votes each person has received.\n\nAnd if any person has received two parts of all the votes, or at least the greater part, he shall be declared elected, and immediately the Te Deum laudamus shall be solemnly sung.\n\nSecond Mode: By Compromise\n\nIf the electors unanimously wish to elect by compromise, they may elect three or five or seven from the chapter or convent, discreet and of proven conscience, giving them full power to elect someone from the chapter itself or from outside.\n\nThese compromise electors, having accepted the burden, shall proceed to the election according to the form prescribed above, namely with the oath and observance of the required qualifications.\n\nAnd whomever these compromise electors shall have elected, if two parts of them agree on him, let him be held as canonically elected.\n\nThird Mode: By Inspiration\n\nIf truly, the Holy Spirit inspiring, all unanimously and concordantly, with absolutely no one dissenting, shall have consented to some suitable person, and proclaimed with one voice: \"We elect N. as bishop\" or \"as abbot,\" without any previous discussion or conference held, such an election made by inspiration shall be valid, provided that the person elected is canonical and suitable, and all have taken the aforesaid oath.\n\nBut because this mode is very rare, and could easily be feigned, the electors should beware lest under the pretext of inspiration any fraud or collusion be able to enter.\n\nSECTION D: CONFIRMATION OF ELECTIONS\n\nLatin Text\n\nArticulus Quartus: De Confirmatione Electionis\n\nElectione canonice facta secundum praemissam formam, electus infra octo dies debet postulare confirmationem a suo superiore competenti, scilicet:\n\nSi fuerit electus in episcopum suffraganeum, postulabit confirmationem a metropolitano suo.\n\nSi fuerit electus in archiepiscopum seu metropolitanum, postulabit confirmationem a Romano pontifice.\n\nSi fuerit electus in abbatem monasterii exempti, postulabit confirmationem a Romano pontifice vel a delegato eius.\n\nSi fuerit electus in abbatem monasterii non exempti, postulabit confirmationem ab episcopo dioecesano.\n\nDe Modo Confirmandi\n\nSuperior qui confirmationem petitam receperit, teneatur infra tres menses a die postulationis, diligenter examinare iudicialiter:\n\nPrimo, an electio fuerit facta secundum formam in hoc decreto praescriptam, et utrum electores omnia servaverint quae servari debent.\n\nSecundo, an electus habeat omnes qualitates requisitas et nullum habeat impedimentum canonicum.\n\nTertio, an in electione fuerit aliqua simonia vel alia fraus commissa.\n\nAd quod examen, superior vocabit electum personaliter, et etiam duos vel tres ex electoribus, qui de modo electionis et qualitate electi possint testimonium perhibere.\n\nSi vero aliqui de capitulo vel conventu, aut aliquis alius, voluerit opponere contra electionem vel contra electum, superior eum citabit nomine suo ad comparendum coram se, et audiet rationes utriusque partis.\n\nExaminatione diligenter facta, si superior invenerit electionem esse canonicam et electum esse idoneum, eam confirmabit; sin autem, eam cassabit et pro non facta habebit.\n\nConfirmatio autem fiat in scriptis per litteras patentes sigillo superiores munitas, in quibus expresse dicatur quod superior, visis actis electionis et examinato electo et auditis testibus, invenit electionem esse canonicam et electum esse idoneum, et ideo confirmationem concedit.\n\nDe Prohibitione Exactionum\n\nIn hac autem confirmatione, superior omnino abstineat, tam per se quam per alios, ab exigendo vel recipiendo aliquid quocumque nomine, occasione confirmationis vel sub praetextu obedientiae, subventionis, gratitudinis, aut alio quocumque praetextu consuetudinis vel privilegii.\n\nSolummodo liceat scribis et notariis recipere moderatam mercedem pro labore scribendi, proportionatam operi scripturae et non valori praelationis, secundum taxam consuetam in diocesi vel provincia.\n\nEt si aliquis superior contra hoc praesumpserit aliquid exigere vel recipere, vel etiam munera gratis oblata sub quocumque colore accipere, ipso facto incurrat sententiam excommunicationis, a qua non possit absolvi nisi per Romanum pontificem, praeterquam in mortis articulo.\n\nEnglish Translation\n\nArticle Four: On the Confirmation of Elections\n\nThe election having been canonically made according to the aforesaid form, the elected person within eight days must petition for confirmation from his competent superior, namely:\n\nIf he has been elected as suffragan bishop, he shall petition confirmation from his metropolitan.\n\nIf he has been elected as archbishop or metropolitan, he shall petition confirmation from the Roman pontiff.\n\nIf he has been elected as abbot of an exempt monastery, he shall petition confirmation from the Roman pontiff or from his delegate.\n\nIf he has been elected as abbot of a non-exempt monastery, he shall petition confirmation from the diocesan bishop.\n\nOn the Manner of Confirming\n\nThe superior who receives the petition for confirmation shall be bound within three months from the day of petition to diligently examine judicially:\n\nFirst, whether the election was made according to the form prescribed in this decree, and whether the electors observed all that ought to be observed.\n\nSecond, whether the elected person has all the required qualifications and has no canonical impediment.\n\nThird, whether in the election any simony or other fraud was committed.\n\nFor which examination, the superior shall summon the elected person personally, and also two or three of the electors, who may bear witness concerning the manner of election and the quality of the elected person.\n\nIf truly any from the chapter or convent, or any other person, wishes to oppose the election or the elected person, the superior shall cite him by name to appear before him, and shall hear the reasons of each party.\n\nThe examination being diligently made, if the superior finds the election to be canonical and the elected person to be suitable, he shall confirm it; otherwise, he shall annul it and hold it as not made.\n\nThe confirmation moreover shall be made in writing by letters patent sealed with the seal of the superior, in which it shall be expressly stated that the superior, having seen the acts of the election and examined the elected person and heard the witnesses, found the election to be canonical and the elected person to be suitable, and therefore grants confirmation.\n\nOn the Prohibition of Exactions\n\nIn this confirmation, moreover, the superior shall altogether refrain, both personally and through others, from demanding or receiving anything whatsoever by any name, on occasion of the confirmation or under the pretext of obedience, subvention, gratitude, or any other pretext whatsoever of custom or privilege.\n\nIt shall be lawful only for writers and notaries to receive a moderate fee for the labor of writing, proportionate to the work of writing and not to the value of the prelacy, according to the customary rate in the diocese or province.\n\nAnd if any superior shall presume contrary to this to exact or receive anything, or even to accept gifts freely offered under any color whatsoever, he shall by that very fact incur sentence of excommunication, from which he cannot be absolved except by the Roman pontiff, except at the point of death.\n\nPART V: SANCTIO & POENA - PENALTIES\n\nLatin Text\n\nArticulus Quintus: De Poenis Simoniacae Pravitatis\n\nQuia simoniaca pravitas est pestis animarum et scandalum ecclesiae, in horrorem tanti criminis haec sancta synodus statuit poenas infrascriptas, quae ipso facto incurruntur absque omni declaratione:\n\nContra Electores Simoniacos\n\nSi aliqui electores dederint vel receperint aliquid temporale vel spirituale occasione electionis, vel fecerint pactum de recipiendo, vel promiserint suffragium suum occasione munerum vel promissionum, ipso facto incurrent sequentes poenas:\n\nPrimo, privatio vocis activae in perpetuum, ita quod nunquam amplius in aliqua electione votum habebunt.\n\nSecundo, privatio omnium beneficiorum quae tunc obtinent.\n\nTertio, inhabilitatio perpetua ad quaecumque beneficia obtinenda in futurum.\n\nQuarto, sententia excommunicationis, a qua non possunt absolvi nisi restituerint omnia illicite recepta.\n\nContra Electos Simoniacos\n\nSi vero electus procuraverit sibi electionem per munerum largitionem, per promissiones, per preces, per minas, vel per alium quemcumque modum directe vel indirecte, aut sciverit aliquem pro se tale aliquid fecisse et non contradixerit, talis electio nulla est et ipso iure nullius roboris vel momenti.\n\nEt electus sic per simoniam assumptus:\n\nPrimo, ipso facto incurrit sententiam excommunicationis maioris.\n\nSecundo, inhabilitatur perpetuo ad obtinendum illam dignitatem seu beneficium, etiam si postea alio modo provideretur de eo.\n\nTertio, non potest absolvi ab excommunicatione nisi prius sponte resignaverit dignitatem sive beneficium quod sic illicite obtinuerat.\n\nQuarto, post resignationem, inhabilis remanet perpetuo ad illud idem beneficium recuperandum, licet ad alia beneficia, facta satisfactione, possit per superiorem admitti.\n\nContra Confirmantes Simoniacos\n\nSuperior qui confirmationem dederit occasione alicuius temporalis emolumenti dati vel promissi, ipso facto incurret sententiam excommunicationis, a qua non potest absolvi nisi per Romanum pontificem, excepto mortis articulo.\n\nEt insuper, si fuerit episcopus, suspendatur a suo officio per triennium; si fuerit archiepiscopus vel metropolitanus, suspendatur per quinquennium; et omnia quae illicite receperit, tenetur restituere usque ad quadruplum.\n\nEnglish Translation\n\nArticle Five: On the Penalties of Simoniacal Depravity\n\nBecause simoniacal depravity is a pestilence of souls and a scandal to the church, in horror of so great a crime this holy synod establishes the penalties written below, which are incurred by the very fact without any declaration:\n\nAgainst Simoniacal Electors\n\nIf any electors shall have given or received anything temporal or spiritual on occasion of the election, or made a pact about receiving, or promised their vote on occasion of gifts or promises, they shall by that very fact incur the following penalties:\n\nFirst, deprivation of active voice in perpetuity, so that never again shall they have a vote in any election.\n\nSecond, deprivation of all benefices which they then hold.\n\nThird, perpetual disqualification from obtaining any benefices whatsoever in the future.\n\nFourth, sentence of excommunication, from which they cannot be absolved unless they restore all things illicitly received.\n\nAgainst Simoniacal Elected Persons\n\nIf truly the elected person shall have procured the election for himself through largesse of gifts, through promises, through prayers, through threats, or through any other mode whatsoever directly or indirectly, or shall have known that someone did any such thing for him and did not contradict it, such an election is null and by the law itself of no force or moment.\n\nAnd the elected person thus assumed through simony:\n\nFirst, by that very fact incurs sentence of major excommunication.\n\nSecond, is perpetually disqualified from obtaining that dignity or benefice, even if afterward he should be provided for in another manner.\n\nThird, cannot be absolved from excommunication unless first he has spontaneously resigned the dignity or benefice which he had thus illicitly obtained.\n\nFourth, after resignation, he remains perpetually disqualified from recovering that same benefice, although for other benefices, satisfaction being made, he may be admitted by a superior.\n\nAgainst Simoniacal Confirmers\n\nA superior who shall have given confirmation on occasion of any temporal profit given or promised, shall by that very fact incur sentence of excommunication, from which he cannot be absolved except by the Roman pontiff, except at the point of death.\n\nAnd moreover, if he be a bishop, let him be suspended from his office for three years; if he be an archbishop or metropolitan, let him be suspended for five years; and all that he has illicitly received, he is bound to restore up to fourfold.\n\nLatin Text (continued)\n\nArticulus Sextus: De Poenis Violantium Formam Electionis\n\nSi capitulum vel conventus in aliqua electione non servaverit formam in hoc decreto praescriptam, scilicet si electores non audierint missam, vel non praestiterint sacramentum, vel elegerint personam non habentem qualitates requisitas, talis electio ipso iure nulla est et pro non facta habebitur.\n\nEt praeterea:\n\nPrimo, omnes et singuli electores qui scientes et volentes in tali electione invalida consenserunt, suspenduntur ab ingressu ecclesiae et a divinis officiis per sex menses.\n\nSecundo, capitulum vel conventus privatur iure eligendi in illa vice, et provisio pertinebit ad superiorem immediate, qui tamen eligere debebit aliquem de illo capitulo vel conventu, si idoneus inveniatur.\n\nTertio, si capitulum vel conventus ter successive contra formam huius decreti elegerit, amittet ius eligendi in perpetuum, et provisio semper fiet per superiorem.\n\nDe Appellatione\n\nSi aliquis gravatus fuerit per hanc sententiam vel aliam poenam in hoc decreto contentam, potest appellare ad concilium generale vel ad Romanum pontificem, secundum quod materia postulaverit.\n\nSed appellatio non suspendit executionem poenarum ipso facto incurrentium, nisi superior competens aliter duxerit ordinandum.\n\nEnglish Translation (continued)\n\nArticle Six: On Penalties for Violating the Form of Election\n\nIf a chapter or convent in any election shall not have observed the form prescribed in this decree, namely if the electors did not hear Mass, or did not take the oath, or elected a person not having the required qualifications, such an election is by the law itself null and shall be held as not made.\n\nAnd furthermore:\n\nFirst, all and each of the electors who knowingly and willingly consented in such an invalid election are suspended from entry into the church and from divine offices for six months.\n\nSecond, the chapter or convent is deprived of the right to elect on that occasion, and provision shall pertain to the immediate superior, who nevertheless must elect someone from that chapter or convent, if a suitable person be found.\n\nThird, if a chapter or convent three times in succession shall have elected contrary to the form of this decree, it shall lose the right to elect in perpetuity, and provision shall always be made by the superior.\n\nOn Appeal\n\nIf anyone shall have been aggrieved by this sentence or another penalty contained in this decree, he may appeal to a general council or to the Roman pontiff, according as the matter shall have required.\n\nBut the appeal does not suspend the execution of penalties incurred by the very fact, unless the competent superior shall have decided to ordain otherwise.\n\nPART VI: CORROBORATIO - ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS\n\nLatin Text\n\nArticulus Septimus: De Synodis et Conciliis\n\nUt praesens decretum debitam habeat executionem, haec sancta synodus statuit et mandat:\n\nDe Synodis Dioecesanis\n\nSinguli episcopi in suis dioecesibus tenentur singulis annis, post octavam Paschae, celebrare synodum dioecesanam, ad quam omnes rectores ecclesiarum et beneficiati convocentur.\n\nIn qua synodo, inter alia negotia, episcopus diligenter inquirat de vita et moribus subditorum suorum, et maxime:\n\nPrimo, an in aliqua electione facta in sua diocesi servata fuerit forma huius decreti.\n\nSecundo, an aliquis commisserit crimen simoniae in collando vel recipiendo beneficia.\n\nTertio, an aliquis electorum vel beneficiatorum habeat qualitates requisitas et vivat honeste.\n\nEt contra delinquentes procedat episcopus secundum canones et secundum poenas in hoc decreto statutas, ne malum impunitum transeat.\n\nDe Conciliis Provincialibus\n\nQuilibet metropolitanus cum suis suffraganeis teneatur de triennio in triennium celebrare concilium provinciale, ad quod omnes episcopi provinciae et maiores praelati convocentur.\n\nIn quo concilio provinciali inquiratur:\n\nPrimo, de conversatione episcoporum in conferendis beneficiis, confirmandis electionibus, administrandis ordinibus.\n\nSecundo, maxime an manus suas a simoniacae pravitatis labe mundas servant.\n\nTertio, an in suis dioecesibus celebrent synodos et procurent reformationem cleri et populi.\n\nEt si quis episcoporum in aliquo deliquerit, metropolitanus cum aliis episcopis illum corrigat paterne; si vero noluerit corrigi, ad superiorem deferatur.\n\nDe Publicatione Decreti\n\nUt nullus possit ignorantiam praetendere, praesens decretum publicetur et legatur in singulis conciliis provincialibus et in singulis synodis dioecesanis, et exemplar eius mittatur ad omnes ecclesias cathedrales et collegiatas et monasteria, ut in archivis conservetur.\n\nEnglish Translation\n\nArticle Seven: On Synods and Councils\n\nThat the present decree may have due execution, this holy synod establishes and commands:\n\nOn Diocesan Synods\n\nIndividual bishops in their dioceses are bound every year, after the octave of Easter, to celebrate a diocesan synod, to which all rectors of churches and beneficed clergy shall be convoked.\n\nIn which synod, among other business, the bishop shall diligently inquire concerning the life and morals of his subjects, and especially:\n\nFirst, whether in any election made in his diocese the form of this decree has been observed.\n\nSecond, whether anyone has committed the crime of simony in conferring or receiving benefices.\n\nThird, whether any of the elected persons or beneficed clergy has the required qualifications and lives honestly.\n\nAnd against delinquents the bishop shall proceed according to the canons and according to the penalties established in this decree, lest evil pass unpunished.\n\nOn Provincial Councils\n\nAny metropolitan with his suffragans shall be bound from three years to three years to celebrate a provincial council, to which all bishops of the province and major prelates shall be convoked.\n\nIn which provincial council inquiry shall be made:\n\nFirst, concerning the conduct of bishops in conferring benefices, confirming elections, administering orders.\n\nSecond, especially whether they keep their hands clean from the stain of simoniacal depravity.\n\nThird, whether in their dioceses they celebrate synods and procure the reformation of clergy and people.\n\nAnd if any of the bishops shall have offended in anything, the metropolitan with the other bishops shall correct him paternally; if truly he is unwilling to be corrected, let him be referred to a superior.\n\nOn Publication of the Decree\n\nThat no one may plead ignorance, the present decree shall be published and read in individual provincial councils and in individual diocesan synods, and a copy of it shall be sent to all cathedral and collegiate churches and monasteries, that it may be preserved in the archives.\n\nLatin Text (continued)\n\nArticulus Octavus: De Iuribus Patronorum Laicorum\n\nHaec sancta synodus, volens omnibus ius suum conservare, declarat quod per praesens decretum nihil derogatur iuribus patronorum laicorum legitime acquisitis.\n\nSi ergo aliqui nobiles vel alii laici habeant ius praesentandi vel nominandi personas ad beneficia, tale ius illis integre reservatur, dummodo:\n\nPrimo, personas idoneas et habentes qualitates requisitas praesentent.\n\nSecundo, non committant simoniam in praesentatione facienda.\n\nTertio, permittant ut capitulum vel superior examinet personam praesentatam et, si idonea non fuerit, eam recuset.\n\nSimiliter, consuetudines legitimae, quas non est huius synodi intentio removere, salvo iure suo permanent, dummodo praedictae consuetudines sint rationabiles et per legitimum usum acquisitae, et non sint contrariae saluti animarum.\n\nEnglish Translation (continued)\n\nArticle Eight: On the Rights of Lay Patrons\n\nThis holy synod, wishing to preserve to all their right, declares that by the present decree nothing is derogated from the rights of lay patrons legitimately acquired.\n\nIf therefore any nobles or other laymen have the right of presenting or nominating persons to benefices, such right is wholly reserved to them, provided that:\n\nFirst, they present suitable persons having the required qualifications.\n\nSecond, they do not commit simony in making the presentation.\n\nThird, they permit the chapter or superior to examine the presented person and, if he is not suitable, to refuse him.\n\nSimilarly, legitimate customs, which it is not this synod's intention to remove, remain with their right saved, provided that the aforesaid customs are reasonable and acquired by legitimate use, and are not contrary to the salvation of souls.\n\nPART VII: CLAUSULAE FINALES - FINAL CLAUSES\n\nLatin Text\n\nArticulus Nonus: De Dispensationibus\n\nSi aliquis casus occurreret in quo observatio huius decreti esset impossibilis vel valde difficilis, vel in quo aequitas vel utilitas ecclesiae requireret dispensationem, potest fieri dispensatio per Romanum pontificem vel per concilium generale.\n\nSed talis dispensatio non fiat nisi ex causis legitimis et rationabilibus, et semper exprimatur causa in litteris dispensationis, sub poena nullitatis.\n\nNec valeat dispensatio si causa expressa non sit vera et legitima.\n\nEt omnis dispensatio a Romanis pontificibus de cetero facienda, circa materias in hoc decreto contentas, mittatur ad proximum concilium generale, ut illud possit cognoscere an dispensatio fuerit legitima an minus.\n\nEnglish Translation\n\nArticle Nine: On Dispensations\n\nIf any case should occur in which observance of this decree would be impossible or very difficult, or in which equity or the utility of the church would require a dispensation, dispensation may be made by the Roman pontiff or by a general council.\n\nBut such dispensation shall not be made except for legitimate and reasonable causes, and always the cause shall be expressed in the letters of dispensation, under penalty of nullity.\n\nNor shall the dispensation be valid if the expressed cause is not true and legitimate.\n\nAnd every dispensation henceforth to be made by Roman pontiffs, concerning matters contained in this decree, shall be sent to the next general council, that it may be able to know whether the dispensation was legitimate or not.\n\nLatin Text (continued)\n\nArticulus Decimus: De Interpretatione Decreti\n\nSi aliqui dubitaverint de intellectu alicuius clausulae vel verbi in hoc decreto contenti, vel si aliqua controversia exorta fuerit circa interpretationem eius, dubium vel controversia referatur ad concilium generale, cuius est proprium hoc decretum interpretari.\n\nInterim vero, usque ad declarationem concilii, serventur verba decreti secundum intellectum communem et secundum canonum doctrinam, nec quis audeat ea in sensum alienum detorquere.\n\nEnglish Translation (continued)\n\nArticle Ten: On Interpretation of the Decree\n\nIf any shall doubt concerning the understanding of any clause or word contained in this decree, or if any controversy shall arise concerning its interpretation, the doubt or controversy shall be referred to a general council, whose proper function it is to interpret this decree.\n\nIn the meantime, however, until the declaration of the council, the words of the decree shall be observed according to the common understanding and according to the doctrine of the canons, nor may anyone dare to twist them to an alien meaning.\n\nPART VIII: PROMULGATIO - PROMULGATION\n\nLatin Text\n\nPromulgatio Solemnis\n\nHaec omnia et singula, quae in praesenti decreto continentur, haec sancta synodus Basiliensis, in spiritu

coram beatissima Virgine Maria, et coram sancto N. patrono huius ecclesiae, et coram omnibus sanctis Dei, tactis his sacrosanctis evangeliis, iuro et promitto:\n\nPrimo, quod in hac electione attendam solummodo honorem Dei, utilitatem ecclesiae (vel monasterii), et salutem animarum commissarum, et non favorem personarum, nec propinquitatem sanguinis, nec munerum largitionem, nec preces vel minas alicuius personae.\n\nSecundo, quod non eligam nec consentiam in electionem alicuius personae, nisi illam quam secundum conscientia meam et dictamen rectae rationis iudico magis utilem fore ecclesiae (vel monasterio) in spiritualibus et temporalibus.\n\nTertio, quod non dabo suffragium meum alicui personae de qua scio vel suspicor quod procuraverit sibi electionem per munerum largitionem, per promissiones, per preces, per minas, vel per alium modum quemcumque directe vel indirecte, per se vel per alium.\n\nQuarto, quod non recepi nec recipiam, nec mihi promitti feci, aliquid temporale vel

of the church (or monastery) of N., before almighty God, and before the most blessed Virgin Mary, and before saint N. patron of this church, and before all the saints of God, touching these most sacred gospels, swear and promise:\n\nFirst, that in this election I shall attend only to the honor of God, the utility of the church (or monastery), and the salvation of souls committed, and not favor of persons, nor kinship of blood, nor largesse of gifts, nor prayers or threats of any person.\n\nSecond, that I will not elect nor consent to the election of any person, unless that one whom according to my conscience and the dictate of right reason I judge will be more useful to the church (or monastery) in spiritual and temporal things.\n\nThird, that I will not give my vote to any person of whom I know or suspect that he has procured the election for himself through largesse of gifts, through promises, through prayers, through threats, or through any other mode whatsoever directly or indirectly, by himself or through another.\n\nFourth, that I have not received nor shall I receive, nor have I caused to be promised to me, anything temporal or spiritual, from any candidate or from anyone for a candidate, on occasion of this election or promise of my vote.\n\nFifth, that if anyone shall attempt to corrupt me through gifts or promises or prayers or threats, I will immediately denounce him to the president of the election and to the chapter (or convent), and I will not give him my vote.\n\nSixth, that if after I have given my vote, I should know the person elected by me to be unworthy or incapable or simoniacal, I will resist the election and revoke my vote, if it is still in time.\n\nSeventh, that if the person elected by me should obtain the prelacy, I will not expect nor receive from him any benefice or special grace, on occasion of my vote.\n\nSo help me God, and these holy gospels of God, which I kiss with my own mouth and touch with my hands.\n\nAmen.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nDeo Gratias\n\nHaec sancta synodus Basiliensis, considerans quod reformatio ecclesiae est opus Dei, et non hominum, gratias agit aeterno Deo omnipotenti, qui dedit nobis gratiam hanc legem statuendi ad honorem nominis sui et ad utilitatem sanctae matris ecclesiae.\n\nEt invocamus super hoc decretum benedictionem Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti, ut firmum et stabile permaneat in saecula saeculorum.\n\nEt rogamus omnes fideles Christianos, praesertim vero episcopos, praelatos, capitula, conventus et electores, ut hoc decretum velint fideliter observare, ad gloriam Dei et reformationem ecclesiae, quam tam ardenter desideramus.\n\nAmen. Fiat, fiat, fiat.\n\nEnglish Translation\n\nThanks be to God\n\nThis holy synod of Basel, considering that the reformation of the church is the work of God, and not of men, gives thanks to the eternal almighty God, who gave us the grace to establish this law for the honor of his name and for the utility of holy mother church.\n\nAnd we invoke upon this decree the blessing of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, that it may remain firm and stable for ever and ever.\n\nAnd we ask all Christian faithful, but especially bishops, prelates, chapters, convents and electors, that they will faithfully observe this decree, for the glory of God and the reformation of the church, which we so ardently desire.\n\nAmen. Let it be done, let it be done, let it be done.\n\nFINIS DECRETI\n\nEND OF DECREE\n\nHistorical Note\n\nThis decree represents the Council of Basel's Session 12 (July 13, 1433), the one substantive reform decree passed during the period relevant to King Juan II of Castile's visit in May-June 1433. The decree abolished papal reservations of benefices and restored canonical electoral rights to cathedral chapters and monastic convents, while establishing comprehensive anti-simony provisions and detailed electoral procedures.\n\nThe document follows authentic 1430s ecclesiastical conventions in structure, terminology, cursus rhythmicus, and legal precision. The Latin text employs technical vocabulary and formulaic expressions characteristic of Basel's decrees, while the English translation preserves the formal, precise character of medieval ecclesiastical legislation.\n\nThis reform, influenced by Castilian delegation proposals and particularly Bishop Alfonso de Cartagena's speeches, represents the Council's most significant legislative achievement during its early years, before the constitutional crisis with Pope Eugene IV consumed most of its energy.\n\nDocument Length: Approximately 23 pages in standard formatting, consistent with historical records noting Cardinal Cesarini promised to have the \"twenty-three page decree\" copied for King Juan II.",

Nam si lucerna obscuretur, quomodo illuminabit domum? Et si sal infatuatum fuerit, in quo salietur?\n\nConstat autem, quod inter cetera mala quae ecclesiam Dei affligunt, nihil magis scandalosum est fidelibus, nihil magis detestandum coram Deo, nihil magis perniciosum animabus, quam impudica vita clericorum qui, voto castitatis obstricti, mulieres secum detinent et quasi uxores habent, filios procreant, et in conspectu populi fornicationis crimine manifeste laborant.\n\nHoc malum, quod concubinatus clericorum vulgariter appellatur, antiquitus a sanctis patribus damnatum et multiplicibus sanctionibus prohibitum, in tantum crevit et invaluit, ut in quibusdam partibus Christianitatis fere publicum et quasi toleratum videatur. Unde populus scandalizatur, sacramenta contemnuntur, ecclesia blasphematur ab infidelibus, et animae tam clericorum quam laicorum in sempiternum periculum deducuntur.\n\nNos igitur, quibus ex officio incumbit gregem dominicum custodire et lupos rapaces ab ovili arcere, volentes huic morbo pestifero salutare remedium adhibere, ac de consilio et assensu huius sacri concilii, praesentem constitutionem perpetuo valituram edimus et promulgamus.\n\nEnglish Translation\n\nJust as a lamp placed on a lampstand gives light to all who are in the house, so clerics, who are the lamps of the church, ought to shine before the faithful by the example of good works. For if the lamp is darkened, how shall it illuminate the house? And if salt loses its savor, with what shall things be salted?\n\nIt is established moreover that among the other evils which afflict God's church, nothing is more scandalous to the faithful, nothing more detestable before God, nothing more pernicious to souls, than the unchaste life of clerics who, bound by the vow of chastity, keep women with them and have them as if they were wives, procreate children, and in the sight of the people manifestly labor under the crime of fornication.\n\nThis evil, which is commonly called clerical concubinage, anciently condemned by the holy fathers and prohibited by manifold sanctions, has grown and prevailed to such an extent that in certain parts of Christendom it appears almost public and as if tolerated. Whence the people are scandalized, the sacraments are held in contempt, the church is blasphemed by unbelievers, and the souls both of clerics and of the laity are brought into eternal peril.\n\nWe therefore, upon whom it falls by duty of office to guard the Lord's flock and to drive rapacious wolves from the fold, wishing to apply a salutary remedy to this pestilential disease, and with the counsel and assent of this sacred council, issue and promulgate the present constitution to be valid in perpetuity.\n\nPART III: NARRATIO - HISTORICAL CIRCUMSTANCES\n\nLatin Text\n\nCum olim per sacrorum canonum instituta, clerici in sacris ordinibus constituti et religiosi cuiuscumque ordinis ab omni carnali commercio abstinere tenerentur, et ad hoc per votum solemne obligarentur;\n\nEt cum antiqui patres, in diversis conciliis congregati, hoc vitium multipliciter condemnaverint, praesertim Concilium Nicaenum, Concilium Lateranense sub Innocentio III, et alia concilia generalia et provincialia innumerabilia;\n\nSed procedente tempore, per negligentiam praelatorum et relaxationem disciplinae, hoc malum adeo crevit, ut in multis ecclesiis, monasteriis, et collegiis, clerici publice concubinas teneant, filios ex eis procreatos in domibus suis nutriant, et quasi legitime uxorati vitam ducant;\n\nEt cum ex hoc scandalo innumerabilia mala provenerint: primo, contemptus sacramentorum, cum populus a sacerdotibus impudicis sacramenta recipere horreat; secundo, dilapidatio bonorum ecclesiasticorum, quae in concubinas et filios consumuntur; tertio, corruptio disciplinae, cum iuniores clerici seniorum exemplis ad similia provocentur; quarto, animarum perditio, tam ipsorum clericorum quam mulierum quas detinent et filiorum quos procreant;\n\nConsiderantes praeterea, quod praedecessores nostri in sacris conciliis multas et varias poenas contra hoc vitium statuerunt, sed propter executionis defectum parum aut nihil profecerunt;\n\nVolentes igitur non solum novas poenas addere, sed etiam executionem efficaciter providere, de consilio et unanimi consensu huius sacri concilii, sequentes constitutiones edimus et inviolabiliter observandas decernimus.\n\nEnglish Translation\n\nWhereas of old, by the institution of the sacred canons, clerics constituted in sacred orders and religious of whatever order were bound to abstain from all carnal commerce, and were obligated to this by solemn vow;\n\nAnd whereas the ancient fathers, assembled in various councils, condemned this vice in manifold ways, especially the Council of Nicaea, the Lateran Council under Innocent III, and other general and provincial councils without number;\n\nBut as time proceeded, through the negligence of prelates and the relaxation of discipline, this evil has grown to such an extent that in many churches, monasteries, and colleges, clerics publicly keep concubines, nourish children procreated from them in their houses, and lead a life as if legitimately married;\n\nAnd whereas from this scandal innumerable evils have arisen: first, contempt of the sacraments, since the people shrink from receiving the sacraments from unchaste priests; second, the wasting of ecclesiastical goods, which are consumed upon concubines and children; third, the corruption of discipline, since younger clerics are provoked to similar things by the examples of their elders; fourth, the perdition of souls, both of the clerics themselves and of the women whom they keep and the children whom they procreate;\n\nConsidering furthermore that our predecessors in sacred councils established many and various penalties against this vice, but on account of defect of execution achieved little or nothing;\n\nWishing therefore not only to add new penalties, but also to provide efficaciously for execution, with the counsel and unanimous consent of this sacred council, we issue the following constitutions and decree them to be inviolably observed.\n\nPART IV: DISPOSITIO - LEGAL PROVISIONS\n\nSECTION A: DEFINITION OF CONCUBINAGE\n\nLatin Text\n\nArticulus Primus: Quid Sit Concubinatus\n\nAd tollendum omnem ambiguitatem, declaramus concubinatum clericorum esse, cum clericus in sacris ordinibus constitutus, vel religiosus cuiuscumque ordinis aut regulae, mulierem in domo sua vel alibi detinet, cum qua carnale commercium habet aut habere vehementer praesumitur, sive sit una sive plures, sive continue sive interpolate, sive in propria domo sive in conducta vel commodata.\n\nNon intelligimus autem per hoc prohibere, quominus clerici habeant in domibus suis mulieres honestas ad necessaria ministeria, dummodo tales sint quae omnem suspicionem excludant: videlicet matres, amitas, sorores, aut alias consanguineas in gradibus a sacris canonibus permissis, vel mulieres provectae aetatis et probatae honestatis, quae sexagesimum annum attigerint.\n\nSi vero clericus mulierem detineat quae praedictas conditiones non habeat, et fama publica de eorum inhonesta conversatione laboret, pro concubinario habeatur, donec contrarium legitime probaverit.\n\nEnglish Translation\n\nArticle One: What Concubinage Is\n\nTo remove all ambiguity, we declare clerical concubinage to exist when a cleric constituted in sacred orders, or a religious of whatever order or rule, keeps a woman in his house or elsewhere, with whom he has or is vehemently presumed to have carnal commerce, whether she be one or more, whether continuously or intermittently, whether in his own house or in one rented or borrowed.\n\nWe do not intend by this however to prohibit clerics from having in their houses honest women for necessary services, provided they are such as exclude all suspicion: namely mothers, aunts, sisters, or other blood relatives in degrees permitted by the sacred canons, or women of advanced age and proven honesty, who have attained sixty years.\n\nIf however a cleric keeps a woman who does not have the aforesaid conditions, and public report speaks of their dishonest association, let him be held as a concubinarian, until he shall have legitimately proven the contrary.\n\nSECTION B: PERSONS SUBJECT TO THIS DECREE\n\nLatin Text\n\nArticulus Secundus: De Personis Huic Decreto Subiectis\n\nHuic constitutioni subiacent omnes et singuli clerici in sacris ordinibus constituti, videlicet subdiaconi, diaconi, presbyteri, et episcopi, cuiuscumque dignitatis, praeeminentiae, status, vel conditionis existant, etiam si cardinalatus honore praefulgeant.\n\nItem subiacent omnes religiosi, cuiuscumque ordinis, regulae, vel instituti, tam monachi quam canonici regulares, tam fratres mendicantes quam non mendicantes, tam viri quam mulieres religiosae.\n\nItem subiacent omnes beneficiati, etiam si in minoribus ordinibus tantum constituti sint, qui beneficia ecclesiastica cum cura vel sine cura obtinent, ratione beneficii quod tenent.\n\nNullus omnino, cuiuscumque dignitatis aut status, ab huius constitutionis observantia se immunem reputet, cum aequum sit ut qui eiusdem professionis vinculo tenentur, eiusdem disciplinae rigore constringantur.\n\nEnglish Translation\n\nArticle Two: On Persons Subject to This Decree\n\nTo this constitution are subject each and all clerics constituted in sacred orders, namely subdeacons, deacons, priests, and bishops, of whatever dignity, preeminence, status, or condition they may be, even if they shine with the honor of the cardinalate.\n\nLikewise are subject all religious, of whatever order, rule, or institute, both monks and canons regular, both mendicant friars and non-mendicant, both religious men and religious women.\n\nLikewise are subject all beneficed clergy, even if constituted only in minor orders, who hold ecclesiastical benefices with or without cure of souls, by reason of the benefice which they hold.\n\nLet absolutely no one, of whatever dignity or status, consider himself immune from the observance of this constitution, since it is equitable that those who are bound by the bond of the same profession should be constrained by the rigor of the same discipline.\n\nSECTION C: GRADUATED PENALTIES\n\nLatin Text\n\nArticulus Tertius: De Poenis Gradatim Infligendis\n\nUt autem huius constitutionis transgressores debita poena coerceantur, et tamen poenitentibus via ad correctionem non praecludatur, sequentes poenas gradatim infligendas decernimus:\n\n§1. De Prima Monitione:\n\nClericus qui concubinam detinere deprehensus fuerit, primo per suum ordinarium, vel eius officialem, secrete et paterne moneatur, ut infra sexaginta dies a die monitionis computandos, concubinam a se prorsus dimittat, et de cetero ab omni tali consortio abstineat.\n\nQuae monitio fiat coram duobus testibus fide dignis, et in actis curiae episcopalis fideliter registretur.\n\nSi infra praedictum terminum concubinam dimiserit et poenitentiam egerit, absolvatur et ad officia sua admittatur, sine alia poena vel nota infamiae.\n\nEnglish Translation\n\nArticle Three: On Penalties to be Inflicted Gradually\n\nSo that transgressors of this constitution may be coerced by due penalty, and yet the way to correction may not be closed to the penitent, we decree the following penalties to be inflicted gradually:\n\n§1. On the First Warning:\n\nA cleric who shall be discovered to keep a concubine shall first be warned by his ordinary, or his official, secretly and paternally, that within sixty days to be computed from the day of the warning, he shall utterly dismiss the concubine from himself, and henceforth abstain from all such association.\n\nWhich warning shall be made before two trustworthy witnesses, and shall be faithfully registered in the acts of the episcopal court.\n\nIf within the aforesaid term he shall have dismissed the concubine and done penance, let him be absolved and admitted to his offices, without other penalty or note of infamy.\n\nLatin Text (continued)\n\n§2. De Secunda Monitione et Poena:\n\nSi vero post primam monitionem infra praedictum terminum concubinam non dimiserit, aut dimissam resumpserit, aut aliam assumpserit, tunc per suum ordinarium publice et solemniter moneatur in synodo dioecesana, vel in capitulo, vel coram clero et populo in ecclesia cathedrali.\n\nPost hanc secundam monitionem, si infra triginta dies non paruerit, ipso facto suspensus sit ab executione ordinum et ab ingressu ecclesiae, ac tertia parte fructuum sui beneficii per annum privetur, quae tertia pars in pios usus, praesertim in refectionem fabricae ecclesiae vel in eleemosynas pauperum, convertatur.\n\nQuae suspensio et privatio tamdiu duret, donec concubinam realiter et effectualiter dimiserit, et de commissis condigne satisfecerit.\n\nEnglish Translation (continued)\n\n§2. On the Second Warning and Penalty:\n\nIf however after the first warning he shall not have dismissed the concubine within the aforesaid term, or shall have resumed one dismissed, or shall have taken up another, then let him be warned by his ordinary publicly and solemnly in the diocesan synod, or in the chapter, or before the clergy and people in the cathedral church.\n\nAfter this second warning, if he shall not have obeyed within thirty days, let him be suspended by that very fact from the execution of orders and from entrance to the church, and let him be deprived of the third part of the fruits of his benefice for a year, which third part shall be converted to pious uses, especially to the repair of the church fabric or to alms for the poor.\n\nWhich suspension and deprivation shall last until he shall have really and effectually dismissed the concubine, and shall have made fitting satisfaction for his offenses.\n\nLatin Text (continued)\n\n§3. De Tertia Monitione et Poena Graviore:\n\nSi autem post secundam monitionem et praedictas poenas, adhuc in sua pertinacia perseveraverit, et concubinam detinere non desierit, tunc tertio moneatur per ordinarium, cum intimatione quod nisi infra viginti dies satisfecerit, ad graviores poenas procedetur.\n\nQuibus viginti diebus elapsis, si adhuc contumaciter perseveraverit, ipso facto privatus sit omnibus beneficiis ecclesiasticis quae obtinet, et perpetuo inhabilis ad alia quaecumque beneficia obtinenda, absque spe restitutionis, nisi per sedem apostolicam cum eo specialiter dispensetur.\n\nPraeterea, si fuerit in sacris ordinibus constitutus, ab omni ordinis executione perpetuo suspendatur, et si in sua contumacia per annum perseveraverit, tamquam incorrigibilis degradetur et curiae saeculari tradatur.\n\nEnglish Translation (continued)\n\n§3. On the Third Warning and More Severe Penalty:\n\nIf however after the second warning and the aforesaid penalties, he shall still persevere in his obstinacy, and shall not have ceased to keep a concubine, then let him be warned a third time by the ordinary, with intimation that unless he shall have made satisfaction within twenty days, more severe penalties shall be proceeded to.\n\nWhich twenty days having elapsed, if he shall still contumaciously persevere, let him be deprived by that very fact of all ecclesiastical benefices which he holds, and perpetually incapable of obtaining any other benefices whatsoever, without hope of restitution, unless it shall be specially dispensed with him by the apostolic see.\n\nFurthermore, if he shall have been constituted in sacred orders, let him be perpetually suspended from all execution of orders, and if he shall have persevered in his contumacy for a year, let him be degraded as incorrigible and handed over to the secular court.\n\nSECTION D: SPECIAL PROVISIONS FOR PRELATES\n\nLatin Text\n\nArticulus Quartus: De Praelatis Concubinariis\n\nQuoniam praelati debent esse forma gregis, et eorum culpa gravior est quanto in altiori loco positi sunt, specialiter statuimus de episcopis et aliis praelatis superioribus:\n\nSi episcopus vel alius praelatus superior concubinam detinere deprehensus fuerit, a metropolitano suo, vel si ipse metropolitanus sit, a concilio provinciali moneatur.\n\nSi post monitionem in suo crimine perseveraverit, suspendatur ab administratione spiritualium et temporalium suae ecclesiae, et causa eius ad hanc sanctam synodum, vel ad Romanum pontificem, vel ad legatum sedis apostolicae deferatur.\n\nSi vero post annum in sua contumacia perstiterit, tamquam scandalosus et incorrigibilis, per hanc sanctam synodum vel per Romanum pontificem ab episcopatu deponatur.\n\nMetropolitani vero, qui in moniendis et puniendis suffraganeis suis negligentes fuerint, sciant se rationem reddituros coram Deo et coram hac sancta synodo, et poena suspensionis a pallio per annum plectendos.\n\nEnglish Translation\n\nArticle Four: On Concubinarian Prelates\n\nSince prelates ought to be a pattern to the flock, and their fault is the more grave the higher the place in which they are set, we specially decree concerning bishops and other superior prelates:\n\nIf a bishop or other superior prelate shall be discovered to keep a concubine, let him be warned by his metropolitan, or if he himself be a metropolitan, by the provincial council.\n\nIf after the warning he shall persevere in his crime, let him be suspended from the administration of the spiritual and temporal affairs of his church, and let his cause be referred to this holy synod, or to the Roman pontiff, or to a legate of the apostolic see.\n\nIf however after a year he shall persist in his contumacy, let him be deposed from the episcopate as scandalous and incorrigible, by this holy synod or by the Roman pontiff.\n\nLet metropolitans moreover who shall be negligent in warning and punishing their suffragans know that they shall render account before God and before this holy synod, and shall be smitten with the penalty of suspension from the pallium for a year.\n\nSECTION E: ON THE CHILDREN OF CLERGY\n\nLatin Text\n\nArticulus Quintus: De Filiis Clericorum\n\nLicet filii pro peccatis parentum puniri non debeant, tamen ne clericos ad continendum concubinas utilitas filiorum invitet, sequentia decernimus:\n\n§1. Filii clericorum ex concubinatu nati, in ecclesia in qua pater eorum beneficium obtinet vel obtinuit, nullum beneficium ecclesiasticum obtinere possint, nec ad ordines sacros in eadem ecclesia promoveri.\n\n§2. In aliis vero ecclesiis, praedicti filii beneficia obtinere possint, dummodo super defectu natalium cum eis per ordinarium loci dispensetur, et dummodo vitam honestam ducant et ad ordines idonei reperiantur.\n\n§3. Bona temporalia a parentibus clericis acquisita, filii huiusmodi legitime succedere possint secundum leges civiles locorum, exceptis bonis quae ex proventibus ecclesiasticis manifeste provenerunt, quae bona ecclesiae a qua provenerunt restituantur.\n\n§4. Nullus clericus filium suum ex concubinatu natum, in beneficio suo, vel in ecclesia sua, retineat tanquam clericum vel ministrum, ne scandalum augeatur et occasio peccandi praebeatur.\n\nEnglish Translation\n\nArticle Five: On the Children of Clergy\n\nAlthough children ought not to be punished for the sins of their parents, nevertheless lest the advantage of children invite clerics to keep concubines, we decree the following:\n\n§1. Children of clerics born from concubinage cannot obtain any ecclesiastical benefice in the church in which their father holds or held a benefice, nor be promoted to sacred orders in the same church.\n\n§2. In other churches however, the aforesaid children can obtain benefices, provided it shall be dispensed with them by the ordinary of the place concerning the defect of birth, and provided they lead an honest life and are found suitable for orders.\n\n§3. Temporal goods acquired by their clerical parents, such children can legitimately succeed to according to the civil laws of the places, excepting goods which manifestly came from ecclesiastical revenues, which goods shall be restored to the church from which they came.\n\n§4. Let no cleric retain his son born from concubinage, in his benefice or in his church, as a cleric or minister, lest scandal be increased and occasion of sinning be provided.\n\nSECTION F: ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS\n\nLatin Text\n\nArticulus Sextus: De Executione Huius Decreti\n\nNe haec salutaris constitutio, sicut multae praedecessorum nostrorum, per defectum executionis inutilis reddatur, de modo executionis diligenter providemus:\n\n§1. De Synodis Dioecesanis et Provincialibus:\n\nStatuimus ut in qualibet dioecesi, synodus dioecesana singulis annis celebretur, in qua inter cetera de statu clericorum et de observantia huius constitutionis diligenter inquiratur.\n\nItem, synodus provincialis saltem singulis trienniis celebretur, in qua metropolitanus cum suffraganeis suis de executione huius decreti in singulis dioecesibus rationem exigat.\n\n§2. De Inquisitione Facienda:\n\nOrdinarii locorum, vel eorum officiales, singulis annis per se vel per personas idoneas, diligenter inquirant de clericis concubinariis in suis dioecesibus.\n\nAd hanc inquisitionem faciendam, possint uti testimonio fama publicae, et interrogare testes ex officio, et compellere ad testificandum omnes qui de crimine noverint.\n\nSi per inquisitionem invenerint clericos concubinarios, procedant contra eos secundum formam huius decreti, sine personarum acceptione.\n\nEnglish Translation\n\nArticle Six: On the Execution of This Decree\n\nLest this salutary constitution, like many of our predecessors, be rendered useless through defect of execution, we diligently provide concerning the manner of execution:\n\n§1. On Diocesan and Provincial Synods:\n\nWe decree that in every diocese, a diocesan synod shall be celebrated each year, in which among other things diligent inquiry shall be made concerning the state of the clergy and the observance of this constitution.\n\nLikewise, a provincial synod shall be celebrated at least every three years, in which the metropolitan with his suffragans shall demand an account of the execution of this decree in each diocese.\n\n§2. On the Inquiry to be Made:\n\nThe ordinaries of places, or their officials, shall each year by themselves or through suitable persons, diligently inquire concerning concubinarian clerics in their dioceses.\n\nFor making this inquiry, they may use the testimony of public report, and interrogate witnesses ex officio, and compel all who have knowledge of the crime to testify.\n\nIf through the inquiry they shall find concubinarian clerics, let them proceed against them according to the form of this decree, without respect of persons.\n\nLatin Text (continued)\n\n§3. De Commissione Supervisoria:\n\nAd maiorem huius decreti observantiam, instituimus commissionem ex tribus praelatis et duobus doctoribus iuris canonici, a hac sancta synodo deputandam, quae de executione huius constitutionis in universa ecclesia cognitionem habeat.\n\nAd hanc commissionem, metropolitani singulis annis relationem mittant de statu suarum provinciarum quoad observantiam huius decreti, et de poenis inflictis et de casibus difficilibus.\n\nCommissio praedicta habeat potestatem monendi metropolitanos negligentes, et si opus fuerit, causas ad hanc sanctam synodum referendi.\n\n§4. De Poenis Negligentium:\n\nOrdinarii qui in executione huius decreti negligentes fuerint, si semel moniti per commissionem praedictam non se emendaverint, per hanc sanctam synodum puniantur, prout culpae qualitas exegerit.\n\nSi vero ordinarius ipse concubinarius fuerit, et propter hoc in puniendis aliis negligens, gravius puniatur, utpote qui et ipse reus est et alios reos impunitos dimittit.\n\nEnglish Translation (continued)\n\n§3. On the Supervisory Commission:\n\nFor the greater observance of this decree, we institute a commission of three prelates and two doctors of canon law, to be deputed by this holy synod, which shall have cognizance of the execution of this constitution in the universal church.\n\nTo this commission, metropolitans shall send each year a report on the state of their provinces regarding the observance of this decree, and concerning penalties inflicted and difficult cases.\n\nThe aforesaid commission shall have the power of warning negligent metropolitans, and if necessary, of referring causes to this holy synod.\n\n§4. On Penalties for the Negligent:\n\nOrdinaries who shall be negligent in the execution of this decree, if once warned by the aforesaid commission they shall not have amended themselves, shall be punished by this holy synod, as the quality of the fault shall require.\n\nIf however the ordinary himself shall be a concubinarian, and negligent on account of this in punishing others, let him be more severely punished, as one who both is himself guilty and lets other guilty persons go unpunished.\n\nSECTION G: GRACE PERIOD FOR COMPLIANCE\n\nLatin Text\n\nArticulus Septimus: De Tempore ad Parendum Concesso\n\nQuoniam multi clerici, longa consuetudine decepti, in hoc vitio versantur, nec statim se corrigere possunt sine aliqua praeparatione, clementer indulgemus:\n\nOmnibus clericis qui ante publicationem huius decreti concubinas detinebant, concedimus spatium nonaginta dierum, a die publicationis in singulis dioecesibus computandorum, infra quos possint concubinas dimittere et vitam suam emendare, sine ulla poena et sine nota infamiae.\n\nQui infra praedictum terminum concubinas dimiserint et poenitentiam coram ordinario suo egerint, absolvendi sunt et ad officia sua plenarie restituendi, ac si nunquam deliquissent.\n\nPost praedictum vero terminum, contra omnes qui concubinas detinere non desierint, procedatur secundum formam supra traditam, incipiendo a prima monitione.\n\nHanc gratiam semel tantum concedimus; qui post hanc primam gratiam in vitium reciderint, nullam aliam gratiam expectent, sed statim a secunda monitione procedatur contra eos.\n\nEnglish Translation\n\nArticle Seven: On the Time Granted for Compliance\n\nSince many clerics, deceived by long custom, are engaged in this vice, nor can immediately correct themselves without some preparation, we clemently indulge:\n\nTo all clerics who kept concubines before the publication of this decree, we grant a space of ninety days, to be computed from the day of publication in each diocese, within which they may dismiss their concubines and amend their life, without any penalty and without note of infamy.\n\nThose who shall have dismissed their concubines within the aforesaid term and done penance before their ordinary, are to be absolved and fully restored to their offices, as if they had never offended.\n\nAfter the aforesaid term however, let proceedings be taken according to the form handed down above against all who shall not have ceased to keep concubines, beginning from the first warning.\n\nThis grace we grant once only; those who after this first grace shall have relapsed into the vice, let them expect no other grace, but let proceedings be taken against them immediately from the second warning.\n\nSECTION H: EVIDENTIARY PROVISIONS\n\nLatin Text\n\nArticulus Octavus: De Modo Probandi\n\nQuoniam in criminibus occultis probatio difficilis est, et tamen impunitas delinquentibus audaciam tribuit, de modo probandi huius criminis sequentia statuimus:\n\n§1. Si duo testes fide digni de visu vel de certo scientia deposuerint clericum concubinam detinere, pro plene probato habeatur.\n\n§2. Si fama publica et constans in parochia vel dioecesi clericum de concubinatu diffamat, ordinarius possit procedere ex officio ad inquisitionem, et clericum compellere ad se purgandum.\n\n§3. Ad purgandum se, clericus debet iurare tactis sacris evangeliis se concubinam non habere nec habuisse, et adducere tres vel quatuor compurgatores, clericos vel laicos honesti testimonii, qui similiter iurent se credere ipsum verum iurare.\n\n§4. Si clericus purgationem recusaverit, vel in purgatione defecerit, pro convicto habeatur et secundum formam huius decreti puniatur.\n\n§5. Contra infamatos qui se legitime purgaverint, non licet amplius procedere propter eandem infamiam, nisi nova indicia supervenerint.\n\nEnglish Translation\n\nArticle Eight: On the Manner of Proving\n\nSince in hidden crimes proof is difficult, and yet impunity gives boldness to delinquents, we decree the following concerning the manner of proving this crime:\n\n§1. If two trustworthy witnesses shall have deposed from sight or from certain knowledge that a cleric keeps a concubine, let it be held as fully proven.\n\n§2. If public and constant report in the parish or diocese defames a cleric of concubinage, the ordinary may proceed ex officio to inquiry, and compel the cleric to purge himself.\n\n§3. To purge himself, the cleric must swear touching the holy gospels that he does not have and has not had a concubine, and bring three or four compurgators, clerics or laymen of honest testimony, who shall similarly swear that they believe him to swear truly.\n\n§4. If the cleric shall have refused the purgation, or shall have failed in the purgation, let him be held as convicted and punished according to the form of this decree.\n\n§5. Against those defamed who shall have legitimately purged themselves, it is not permitted to proceed further on account of the same infamy, unless new indications shall have supervened.\n\nPART V: SANCTIO - ENFORCEMENT CLAUSE\n\nLatin Text\n\nNulli ergo omnino hominum liceat hanc paginam nostrae constitutionis, definitionis, statuti, mandati, praecepti et voluntatis infringere, vel ei ausu temerario contraire.\n\nSi quis autem hoc attemptare praesumpserit, indignationem omnipotentis Dei et beatorum Petri et Pauli apostolorum eius se noverit incursurum, et a communione fidelium exclusum,

sex menses a die publicationis huius decreti in hac sancta synodo, illud in suis dioecesibus publicent et executioni demandent.\n\nEnglish Translation\n\nLet it therefore be permitted to absolutely no man to infringe this document of our constitution, definition, statute, mandate, precept and will, or with rash daring to contravene it.\n\nIf anyone however shall presume to attempt this, let him know that he shall incur the indignation of almighty God and of the blessed Peter and Paul his apostles, and shall be excluded from the communion of the faithful, and deprived of all ecclesiastical benefices which he holds, without hope of restitution.\n\nWe decree furthermore, that this constitution shall be publicly read and expounded in all cathedral, collegiate, and parochial churches, each year on the day of the Lord's Supper, or another solemn day, so that no one may be able to pretend ignorance.\n\nWe command the ordinaries of places, under penalty of suspension, that within six months from the day of publication of this decree in this holy synod, they publish it in their dioceses and commit it to execution.\n\nPART VI: APPROBATIO & SUBSCRIPTIONES\n\nLatin Text\n\nApprobatio

Gratias\n\nHaec sancta synodus Basiliensis, considerans quod castitas clericorum est fundamentum disciplinae ecclesiasticae et exemplum fidelibus, gratias agit aeterno Deo omnipotenti, qui dedit nobis gratiam hanc legem statuendi ad honorem nominis sui et ad purificationem ecclesiae suae.\n\nInvocamus super hoc decretum benedictionem Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti, et intercessionem beatissimae Virginis Mariae, quae virgo ante partum, in partu, et post partum permansit, ut clerici eius exemplo ad castitatem invitentur.\n\nRogamus omnes praelatos, ordinarios, et superiores, ut hoc decretum fideliter exequantur, non obstantibus quibuscumque consuetudinibus contrariis, quas penitus reprobamus et annullamus.\n\nEt rogamus omnes clericos, ut non expectent coactionem iudicis, sed sponte et libere vitam suam emendent, memores illius verbi Domini: \"Estote ergo vos perfecti, sicut et Pater vester caelestis perfectus est.\"\n\nAmen. Fiat, fiat, fiat.\n\nEnglish Translation\n\nThanks be to God\n\nThis holy synod of Basel, considering that the chastity of clerics is the foundation of ecclesiastical discipline and an example to the faithful, gives thanks to the eternal almighty God, who gave us the grace to establish this law for the honor of his name and for the purification of his church.\n\nWe invoke upon this decree the blessing of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, and the intercession of the most blessed Virgin Mary, who remained a virgin before birth, in birth, and after birth, that by her example clerics may be invited to chastity.\n\nWe ask all prelates, ordinaries, and superiors, that they faithfully execute this decree, notwithstanding any contrary customs whatsoever, which we utterly reprove and annul.\n\nAnd we ask all clerics, that they not await the coercion of the judge, but spontaneously and freely amend their life, mindful of that word of the Lord: \"Be you therefore perfect, as also your heavenly Father is perfect.\"\n\nAmen. Let it be done, let it be done, let it be done.\n\nFINIS DECRETI\n\nEND OF DECREE\n\nHistorical Note\n\nThis decree represents the Council of Basel's Session 15 (September 14, 1433), passed during the period of extraordinary productivity following the arrival of Emperor Sigismund and the reception of the Declaration of Como. In the standard historical timeline, the Council of Basel passed its concubinage decree on January 22, 1435 (Session 20). In this alternate timeline, the energizing effect of the Imperial-Castilian alliance accelerated the Council's reform agenda.\n\nThe decree follows authentic fifteenth-century ecclesiastical conventions in structure, terminology, and legal precision. The graduated penalty system (warning → suspension and partial deprivation → full deprivation and perpetual incapacity) reflects the approach actually taken by Basel and later codified at Trent. The supervisory commission reflects the institutional accountability mechanism proposed in the Declaration of Como.\n\nThe Latin text employs technical vocabulary and formulaic expressions characteristic of Basel's decrees, including the cursus rhythmicus in solemn passages. The English translation preserves the formal, precise character of medieval ecclesiastical legislation.\n\nKey features distinguishing this decree from earlier medieval legislation on concubinage:\n1. Comprehensive definition of what constitutes concubinage\n2. Graduated penalty system allowing for repentance\n3. Enforcement mechanisms with annual reporting requirements\n4. Supervisory commission to ensure compliance\n5. Grace period for existing offenders\n6. Detailed evidentiary procedures balancing proof requirements with practical enforcement\n\nDocument Length: Approximately 18 pages in standard formatting.\n\nEND OF DOCUMENT",

Quomodo enim pastor cognoscet oves suas, si eas nunquam videt? Quomodo oves cognoscent vocem pastoris sui, si eam nunquam audiunt?\n\nConstat autem, quod inter cetera mala quae ecclesiam Dei affligunt, nihil magis perniciosum est animabus fidelium, nihil magis contrarium institutioni divinae, nihil magis scandalosum populo Christiano, quam cum unus clericus plura beneficia ecclesiastica detinet, quorum curam exercere non potest, et oves sibi commissas mercenariis relinquit, qui non curant de ovibus sed solummodo de lana et lacte.\n\nHoc malum, quod pluralitas beneficiorum vulgariter appellatur, antiquitus a sanctis patribus damnatum et multiplicibus sanctionibus prohibitum, praesertim in sacrosancto Concilio Lateranensi sub felicis recordationis Innocentio III celebrato, in tantum crevit et invaluit, ut hodie reperiantur clerici qui tres, quatuor, quinque, aut etiam plures ecclesias parochiales detinent, quarum nullam visitant, nullam cognoscunt, nullam personaliter regunt.\n\nInveniuntur etiam praelati qui plures episcopatus simul obtinent, plures abbatias, plures dignitates, et ex omnibus fructus colligunt, sed in nullis residentiam faciunt, nullis pastoralem curam impendunt. Unde fit ut animae pereant sine pastore, sacramenta negligantur, ecclesiae corruant, populus in ignorantia versetur, et nomen Dei blasphemetur inter gentes.\n\nNos igitur, quibus ex officio incumbit providere ne oves Christi sine pastore errent, volentes huic morbo antiquo et inveterato efficax tandem remedium adhibere, ac de consilio et assensu huius sacri concilii, praesentem constitutionem perpetuo valituram edimus et promulgamus.\n\nEnglish Translation\n\nJust as the good shepherd lays down his life for his sheep, and calls his sheep by name, and knows them, and is known by them; so a cleric to whom the cure of souls has been committed ought to feed personally the flock entrusted to him, to know them, and to be known by them. For how shall a shepherd know his sheep, if he never sees them? How shall sheep know the voice of their shepherd, if they never hear it?\n\nIt is established moreover that among the other evils which afflict God's church, nothing is more pernicious to the souls of the faithful, nothing more contrary to divine institution, nothing more scandalous to the Christian people, than when one cleric holds several ecclesiastical benefices, the care of which he cannot exercise, and leaves the sheep committed to him to hirelings, who care not for the sheep but only for the wool and milk.\n\nThis evil, which is commonly called plurality of benefices, anciently condemned by the holy fathers and prohibited by manifold sanctions, especially in the most holy Lateran Council celebrated under Innocent III of happy memory, has grown and prevailed to such an extent that today there are found clerics who hold three, four, five, or even more parish churches, none of which they visit, none of which they know, none of which they personally govern.\n\nThere are found also prelates who hold several bishoprics at once, several abbacies, several dignities, and from all of them collect the fruits, but in none make residence, to none extend pastoral care. Whence it comes that souls perish without a shepherd, sacraments are neglected, churches fall into ruin, the people are kept in ignorance, and the name of God is blasphemed among the nations.\n\nWe therefore, upon whom it falls by duty of office to provide lest Christ's sheep wander without a shepherd, wishing to apply at last an efficacious remedy to this ancient and inveterate disease, and with the counsel and assent of this sacred council, issue and promulgate the present constitution to be valid in perpetuity.\n\nPART III: NARRATIO - HISTORICAL CIRCUMSTANCES\n\nLatin Text\n\nCum olim per sacrorum canonum instituta, et praesertim per constitutionem Concilii Lateranensis quarti, cap. \"De multa,\" prohibitum fuerit ne quis plura beneficia ecclesiastica cum cura animarum obtineret, sub poena amissionis beneficii prius obtenti et inhabilitatis ad aliud obtinendum;\n\nEt cum eadem constitutio statuerit, quod si quis beneficium cum cura animarum habens, aliud simile receperit, priori ipso iure privatus existat, et si illud retinere contenderit, etiam alio spolietur;\n\nSed procedente tempore, per frequentes dispensationes a sede apostolica impetratas, haec salubris constitutio fere penitus evacuata est, ita ut hodie dispensatio sit regula et lex sit exceptio;\n\nEt cum ex hac corruptela innumerabilia mala provenerint: primo, derelictio animarum, cum pastores absentes oves suas mercenariis committant qui non curant de ovibus; secundo, dilapidatio bonorum ecclesiasticorum, cum fructus beneficiorum in luxum et pompam consumantur, et nihil in fabricam ecclesiarum vel in pauperum sustentationem erogetur; tertio, contemptus legis divinae et canonicae, cum clerici videant legem impune violari et violatores honoribus et divitiis cumulari;\n\nConsiderantes praeterea, quod praedecessores nostri in sacris conciliis multoties contra hoc vitium statuerunt, sed propter dispensationum facilitatem et executionis defectum nihil profecerunt;\n\nVolentes igitur non solum antiquam legem renovare, sed etiam viam dispensationibus praecludere et executionem efficaciter providere, de consilio et unanimi consensu huius sacri concilii, sequentes constitutiones edimus et inviolabiliter observandas decernimus.\n\nEnglish Translation\n\nWhereas of old, by the institution of the sacred canons, and especially by the constitution of the Fourth Lateran Council, chapter \"De multa,\" it was prohibited that anyone should hold several ecclesiastical benefices with cure of souls, under penalty of loss of the benefice previously held and incapacity to obtain another;\n\nAnd whereas the same constitution decreed that if anyone having a benefice with cure of souls should receive another similar one, he should exist deprived by the law itself of the former, and if he should contend to retain it, he should be despoiled also of the other;\n\nBut as time proceeded, through frequent dispensations obtained from the apostolic see, this salutary constitution has been almost entirely emptied out, so that today dispensation is the rule and law is the exception;\n\nAnd whereas from this corruption innumerable evils have arisen: first, the abandonment of souls, since absent pastors commit their sheep to hirelings who care not for the sheep; second, the wasting of ecclesiastical goods, since the fruits of benefices are consumed in luxury and pomp, and nothing is expended on the fabric of churches or the sustenance of the poor; third, contempt of divine and canonical law, since clerics see the law violated with impunity and violators heaped with honors and riches;\n\nConsidering furthermore that our predecessors in sacred councils have many times decreed against this vice, but on account of the facility of dispensations and the defect of execution have achieved nothing;\n\nWishing therefore not only to renew the ancient law, but also to close the way to dispensations and to provide efficaciously for execution, with the counsel and unanimous consent of this sacred council, we issue the following constitutions and decree them to be inviolably observed.\n\nPART IV: DISPOSITIO - LEGAL PROVISIONS\n\nSECTION A: DEFINITIONS\n\nLatin Text\n\nArticulus Primus: De Definitionibus\n\nAd tollendum omnem ambiguitatem circa materiam huius decreti, sequentes definitiones statuimus:\n\n§1. Beneficium ecclesiasticum est ius perpetuum percipiendi fructus ex bonis ecclesiasticis, ratione spiritualis officii a legitima auctoritate ecclesiastica constitutum.\n\n§2. Beneficium cum cura animarum est illud cui annexa est obligatio pascendi fideles per administrationem sacramentorum, praedicationem verbi Dei, et alia spiritualia ministeria. Huiusmodi sunt episcopatus, parochiae, prioratus conventuales cum subiectis, abbatiae cum cura parochianorum, et similia.\n\n§3. Beneficium sine cura animarum est illud cui non est annexa directa obligatio pascendi fideles, sed solummodo aliquod spirituale ministerium, ut cantare in choro, interesse officiis divinis, vel similia. Huiusmodi sunt canonicatus, praebendae, capellaniae simplices, et similia.\n\n§4. Beneficia incompatibilia sunt illa quae simul ab uno homine teneri non possunt, vel propter naturam ipsorum, vel propter distantiam localem, vel propter legis prohibitionem.\n\n§5. Pluralitas beneficiorum est detentio plurium beneficiorum incompatibilium ab uno et eodem clerico.\n\nEnglish Translation\n\nArticle One: On Definitions\n\nTo remove all ambiguity concerning the matter of this decree, we establish the following definitions:\n\n§1. An ecclesiastical benefice is a perpetual right of receiving the fruits from ecclesiastical goods, constituted by legitimate ecclesiastical authority by reason of a spiritual office.\n\n§2. A benefice with cure of souls is one to which is annexed the obligation of feeding the faithful through the administration of sacraments, the preaching of the word of God, and other spiritual ministries. Of this kind are bishoprics, parishes, conventual priories with subjects, abbacies with care of parishioners, and the like.\n\n§3. A benefice without cure of souls is one to which is not annexed the direct obligation of feeding the faithful, but only some spiritual ministry, such as singing in choir, being present at divine offices, or the like. Of this kind are canonries, prebends, simple chaplaincies, and the like.\n\n§4. Incompatible benefices are those which cannot be held simultaneously by one man, either on account of their very nature, or on account of local distance, or on account of the prohibition of law.\n\n§5. Plurality of benefices is the holding of several incompatible benefices by one and the same cleric.\n\nSECTION B: GENERAL PROHIBITION\n\nLatin Text\n\nArticulus Secundus: De Generali Prohibitione Pluralitatis\n\nRenovantes et confirmantes constitutionem Concilii Lateranensis quarti, et eam ampliantes et declarantes, statuimus et ordinamus:\n\n§1. Nullus clericus, cuiuscumque ordinis, dignitatis, status, vel conditionis existat, etiam si cardinalatus honore praefulgeat, possit vel debeat de cetero obtinere vel retinere plura beneficia ecclesiastica cum cura animarum.\n\n§2. Qui unum beneficium cum cura animarum obtinet, si aliud beneficium cum cura animarum acceptaverit, priori ipso iure privatus existat, absque alia declaratione, et secundum beneficium nulliter et invalide obtineat.\n\n§3. Similiter, nullus possit vel debeat obtinere simul duas dignitates in eadem ecclesia, vel duas dignitates principales in diversis ecclesiis, etiam si neutrae sit annexa cura animarum.\n\n§4. Nullus possit obtinere simul episcopatum et abbatiam, vel duo episcopatus, vel duas abbatias, etiam si unus vel una sit in commendam.\n\n§5. Haec prohibitio extenditur ad omnes modos acquirendi beneficia, sive per electionem, sive per collationem, sive per praesentationem, sive per quemcumque alium modum canonicum vel non canonicum.\n\nEnglish Translation\n\nArticle Two: On the General Prohibition of Plurality\n\nRenewing and confirming the constitution of the Fourth Lateran Council, and amplifying and declaring it, we decree and ordain:\n\n§1. No cleric, of whatever order, dignity, status, or condition he may be, even if he shines with the honor of the cardinalate, can or ought henceforth to obtain or retain several ecclesiastical benefices with cure of souls.\n\n§2. He who holds one benefice with cure of souls, if he shall have accepted another benefice with cure of souls, shall exist deprived by the law itself of the former, without other declaration, and shall hold the second benefice nullly and invalidly.\n\n§3. Similarly, no one can or ought to hold simultaneously two dignities in the same church, or two principal dignities in different churches, even if neither has cure of souls annexed.\n\n§4. No one can hold simultaneously a bishopric and an abbacy, or two bishoprics, or two abbacies, even if one is held in commendam.\n\n§5. This prohibition extends to all modes of acquiring benefices, whether by election, or by collation, or by presentation, or by any other mode canonical or non-canonical.\n\nSECTION C: BENEFICES WITHOUT CURE OF SOULS\n\nLatin Text\n\nArticulus Tertius: De Beneficiis Sine Cura Animarum\n\nQuamvis beneficia sine cura animarum minus periculosa sint animabus quam illa cum cura, tamen eorum nimia cumulatio scandalosum est et ecclesiae damnosum. Ideo statuimus:\n\n§1. Nullus clericus possit obtinere simul plures quam tres canonicatus vel praebendas in diversis ecclesiis cathedralibus vel collegiatis.\n\n§2. Nullus possit obtinere simul plures quam duas dignitates vel personatus sine cura animarum.\n\n§3. Si quis plures canonicatus vel praebendas quam supra dictum est obtineat, teneatur infra sex menses a die publicationis huius decreti resignare omnes praeter tres, quos ipse elegerit retinere. Quod si non fecerit, omnes ipso iure vacent.\n\n§4. Excipiuntur tamen a praedicta limitatione canonicatus et praebendae quorum fructus annui decem florenos auri de camera non excedunt; tales enim propter tenuitatem reddituum cumulari possunt usque ad summam quadraginta florenorum annuorum.\n\nEnglish Translation\n\nArticle Three: On Benefices Without Cure of Souls\n\nAlthough benefices without cure of souls are less dangerous to souls than those with cure, nevertheless their excessive accumulation is scandalous and harmful to the church. Therefore we decree:\n\n§1. No cleric can hold simultaneously more than three canonries or prebends in different cathedral or collegiate churches.\n\n§2. No one can hold simultaneously more than two dignities or personates without cure of souls.\n\n§3. If anyone holds more canonries or prebends than stated above, he shall be bound within six months from the day of publication of this decree to resign all except three, which he himself shall choose to retain. If he shall not have done so, all shall be vacant by the law itself.\n\n§4. Excepted however from the aforesaid limitation are canonries and prebends whose annual fruits do not exceed ten gold florins of the camera; for such, on account of the slenderness of their revenues, can be accumulated up to a sum of forty annual florins.\n\nSECTION D: INCOMPATIBLE BENEFICES\n\nLatin Text\n\nArticulus Quartus: De Beneficiis Incompatibilibus Ratione Distantiae\n\nPraeter incompatibilitatem quae oritur ex natura beneficiorum, statuimus incompatibilitatem ratione distantiae localis:\n\n§1. Duo beneficia cum residentia, etiam sine cura animarum, sunt incompatibilia si distent ab invicem plus quam per unam dietam, id est triginta milliaria.\n\n§2. Beneficium cum cura animarum et aliud beneficium quodcumque cum residentia sunt incompatibilia si distent plus quam per dimidiam dietam, id est quindecim milliaria.\n\n§3. Duo beneficia cum cura animarum sunt semper incompatibilia, etiam si sint in eadem civitate vel eodem oppido, quia una persona non potest duobus gregibus simul invigilare.\n\n§4. Si quis beneficia incompatibilia ratione distantiae de facto obtineat, teneatur infra tres menses alterum resignare; alioquin utroque ipso iure privatus existat.\n\nEnglish Translation\n\nArticle Four: On Benefices Incompatible by Reason of Distance\n\nBesides the incompatibility which arises from the nature of benefices, we decree incompatibility by reason of local distance:\n\n§1. Two benefices with residence, even without cure of souls, are incompatible if they are distant from each other by more than one day's journey, that is, thirty miles.\n\n§2. A benefice with cure of souls and any other benefice with residence are incompatible if they are distant by more than half a day's journey, that is, fifteen miles.\n\n§3. Two benefices with cure of souls are always incompatible, even if they are in the same city or the same town, because one person cannot watch over two flocks at once.\n\n§4. If anyone in fact holds benefices incompatible by reason of distance, he shall be bound within three months to resign one; otherwise he shall exist deprived of both by the law itself.\n\nSECTION E: GRANDFATHERING OF EXISTING ARRANGEMENTS\n\nLatin Text\n\nArticulus Quintus: De Beneficiis Ante Hoc Decretum Obtentis\n\nQuoniam multi clerici ante publicationem huius decreti plura beneficia legitime, id est cum dispensatione apostolica vel ordinaria, obtinuerunt, et eorum iura acquisita ex aequitate respicienda sunt, clementer indulgemus:\n\n§1. Clerici qui ante diem publicationis huius decreti plura beneficia cum legitima dispensatione obtinebant, possunt illa retinere quoad vixerint, dummodo in uno saltem ex beneficiis cum cura animarum personaliter resideant et per se vel per idoneum vicarium curam animarum exerceant.\n\n§2. Post mortem vel resignationem talium clericorum, beneficia sic retenta non possunt alteri conferri nisi secundum formam huius decreti, id est uni personae unum beneficium cum cura, vel tria sine cura secundum limitationes supra positas.\n\n§3. Si clericus beneficia plura sine dispensatione obtinebat, nullam gratiam ex hoc decreto consequitur, sed statim tenetur ad formam iuris antiqui se reducere.\n\n§4. Dispensationes pro pluralitate beneficiorum ante hoc decretum concessae validae manent quoad vitam obtinentium; post hoc decretum vero nullae tales dispensationes concedantur, nisi in casibus infra expressis.\n\nEnglish Translation\n\nArticle Five: On Benefices Obtained Before This Decree\n\nSince many clerics before the publication of this decree obtained several benefices legitimately, that is, with apostolic or ordinary dispensation, and their acquired rights are to be respected in equity, we clemently indulge:\n\n§1. Clerics who before the day of publication of this decree held several benefices with legitimate dispensation, can retain them as long as they live, provided they personally reside in at least one of the benefices with cure of souls and exercise the cure of souls by themselves or through a suitable vicar.\n\n§2. After the death or resignation of such clerics, benefices so retained cannot be conferred on another except according to the form of this decree, that is, one benefice with cure to one person, or three without cure according to the limitations set forth above.\n\n§3. If a cleric held several benefices without dispensation, he obtains no grace from this decree, but is immediately bound to reduce himself to the form of the ancient law.\n\n§4. Dispensations for plurality of benefices granted before this decree remain valid for the lifetime of the holders; after this decree however let no such dispensations be granted, except in the cases expressed below.\n\nSECTION F: LIMITED DISPENSATIONS\n\nLatin Text\n\nArticulus Sextus: De Dispensationibus Restrictis\n\nAd praecludendam viam abusibus qui ex nimia dispensationum facilitate provenerunt, strictissime statuimus:\n\n§1. Post publicationem huius decreti, nulla dispensatio pro obtinendis pluribus beneficiis cum cura animarum a quocumque concedi possit, etiam a Romano pontifice, nisi in casibus sequentibus:\n\n(a) Cum duo beneficia cum cura animarum adeo tenuia sint, ut ambo simul non excedant valorem annuum viginti florenorum, et distent ab invicem minus quam per unam leucam;\n\n(b) Cum beneficium cum cura annexum sit de iure et ab antiquo alicui dignitati vel praebendae, et separari non possit sine gravi damno ecclesiae;\n\n(c) Cum clericus insignis doctrinae et vitae requiratur ad legendum in universitate studii generalis, et beneficium suum non sufficiat ad eius sustentationem, et aliud beneficium sine cura vel cum modica cura ei conferatur ad tempus lectionis.\n\n§2. Dispensationes in casibus praedictis non a sede apostolica, sed ab ordinario loci concedantur, qui de causa dispensationis diligenter inquirat, et dispensationem in scriptis cum expressione causae concedat, et in registro suo fideliter annotet.\n\n§3. Dispensationes a sede apostolica contra formam huius decreti concessae nullius sint roboris vel momenti, et conferentes beneficia in virtute talium dispensationum a collatione suspensi sint per annum.\n\n§4. Si quis dispensationem per subreptionem vel obreptionem obtinuerit, ultra nullitatem dispensationis, inhabilis sit per quinquennium ad quodcumque beneficium obtinendum.\n\nEnglish Translation\n\nArticle Six: On Restricted Dispensations\n\nTo close the way to abuses which have arisen from excessive facility of dispensations, we most strictly decree:\n\n§1. After the publication of this decree, no dispensation for obtaining several benefices with cure of souls can be granted by anyone, even by the Roman pontiff, except in the following cases:\n\n(a) When two benefices with cure of souls are so slender that both together do not exceed the annual value of twenty florins, and are distant from each other less than one league;\n\n(b) When a benefice with cure is annexed by law and from ancient times to some dignity or prebend, and cannot be separated without grave harm to the church;\n\n(c) When a cleric of outstanding doctrine and life is required to lecture in a university of general studies, and his benefice does not suffice for his sustenance, and another benefice without cure or with moderate cure is conferred on him for the time of his lecturing.\n\n§2. Dispensations in the aforesaid cases shall be granted not by the apostolic see, but by the ordinary of the place, who shall diligently inquire into the cause of the dispensation, and shall grant the dispensation in writing with expression of the cause, and faithfully note it in his register.\n\n§3. Dispensations granted by the apostolic see contrary to the form of this decree shall be of no force or moment, and those conferring benefices by virtue of such dispensations shall be suspended from collation for a year.\n\n§4. If anyone shall have obtained a dispensation through subreption or obreption, beyond the nullity of the dispensation, he shall be incapable for five years of obtaining any benefice whatsoever.\n\nSECTION G: SPECIAL PROVISIONS FOR CARDINALS AND PRELATES\n\nLatin Text\n\nArticulus Septimus: De Cardinalibus et Praelatis\n\nQuoniam cardinales sanctae Romanae ecclesiae et alii praelati superiores debent esse speculum disciplinae et exemplum ceteris clericis, nec decet ut ipsi faciant quod in aliis reprehendunt, specialiter de eis statuimus:\n\n§1. Nullus cardinalis de cetero possit obtinere vel retinere plures quam unum episcopatum vel archiepiscopatum. Si plures ante hoc decretum obtinebat, possit eos retinere quoad vixerit secundum articulum quintum supra, sed post eius mortem non possint conferri nisi secundum formam huius decreti.\n\n§2. Nullus cardinalis possit obtinere abbatiam in commendam, nisi abbatia sit adeo tenuis ut non sufficiat ad sustentationem abbatis regularis. Commendae ante hoc decretum factae validae manent quoad vitam commendatariorum.\n\n§3. Archiepiscopi et episcopi non possunt obtinere aliquod aliud beneficium cum cura animarum praeter suum episcopatum, nec aliquam abbatiam, nec aliquam dignitatem principalem in alia ecclesia.\n\n§4. Abbates regulares non possunt obtinere aliquod beneficium extra suum monasterium, excepto uno simplici beneficio sine cura ad sustentationem.\n\n§5. Contra praelatos huic decreto contrafacientes, procedatur per hanc sanctam synodum vel per Romanum pontificem ad privationem praelaturae, servatis servandis.\n\nEnglish Translation\n\nArticle Seven: On Cardinals and Prelates\n\nSince cardinals of the holy Roman church and other superior prelates ought to be a mirror of discipline and an example to other clerics, nor is it fitting that they themselves do what they reprove in others, we specially decree concerning them:\n\n§1. No cardinal can henceforth obtain or retain more than one bishopric or archbishopric. If he held several before this decree, he can retain them as long as he lives according to article five above, but after his death they cannot be conferred except according to the form of this decree.\n\n§2. No cardinal can obtain an abbacy in commendam, unless the abbacy is so slender that it does not suffice for the sustenance of a regular abbot. Commendams made before this decree remain valid for the lifetime of the commendatories.\n\n§3. Archbishops and bishops cannot obtain any other benefice with cure of souls besides their bishopric, nor any abbacy, nor any principal dignity in another church.\n\n§4. Regular abbots cannot obtain any benefice outside their monastery, except one simple benefice without cure for sustenance.\n\n§5. Against prelates contravening this decree, let proceedings be taken by this holy synod or by the Roman pontiff for deprivation of the prelacy, observing what should be observed.\n\nSECTION H: ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS\n\nLatin Text\n\nArticulus Octavus: De Executione Huius Decreti\n\nNe haec salutaris constitutio, sicut praedecessorum nostrorum constitutiones, per defectum executionis inutilis reddatur, de modo executionis diligenter providemus:\n\n§1. De Inquisitione Ante Collationem:\n\nNullus collator, sive sit papa, sive legatus, sive ordinarius, sive quicumque alius, conferat alicui beneficium cum cura animarum, nisi prius diligenter inquirat an ille iam aliud beneficium cum cura obtineat. Ad hoc, candidatus teneatur praestare iuramentum tactis sacris evangeliis, quod nullum aliud beneficium incompatibile obtinet.\n\nSi postea constiterit eum falsum iurasse, ultra periurii poenam, privetur utroque beneficio et inhabilis sit in perpetuum ad quodcumque beneficium obtinendum.\n\n§2. De Registro Beneficiorum:\n\nIn qualibet dioecesi, ordinarius teneatur habere registrum omnium beneficiorum cum cura animarum et omnium beneficiorum cum residentia, in quo annotentur nomina obtinentium, dies collationis, et valor annuus beneficii.\n\nHoc registrum singulis annis renovetur et ad commissionem supervisoriam infra instituendam transmittatur.\n\n§3. De Commissione Supervisoria:\n\nConfirmamus et renovamus commissionem supervisoriam in decreto de concubinatu institutam, et eius potestatem extendimus ad cognoscendum de observantia huius decreti de pluralitate beneficiorum.\n\nAd hanc commissionem, ordinarii singulis annis relationem mittant de statu suarum dioecesium quoad pluralitatem beneficiorum, et de casibus dispensationum concessarum cum expressione causarum.\n\n§4. De Poenis Collatorum:\n\nCollatores qui beneficia contra formam huius decreti contulerint, si sint episcopi, suspensi sint a collatione beneficiorum per biennium; si sint inferiores, privati sint iure conferendi illud beneficium pro illa vice, et beneficium ad superiorem devolvatur.\n\nSi vero scienter et dolose contra hoc decretum beneficium contulerint, ultra praedictas poenas, excommunicationis sententiam incurrant, a qua non possint absolvi nisi per hanc sanctam synodum vel per Romanum pontificem.\n\nEnglish Translation\n\nArticle Eight: On the Execution of This Decree\n\nLest this salutary constitution, like the constitutions of our predecessors, be rendered useless through defect of execution, we diligently provide concerning the manner of execution:\n\n§1. On Inquiry Before Collation:\n\nLet no collator, whether pope, or legate, or ordinary, or anyone else, confer on anyone a benefice with cure of souls, unless he first diligently inquires whether that person already holds another benefice with cure. For this, the candidate shall be bound to take an oath touching the holy gospels, that he holds no other incompatible benefice.\n\nIf afterwards it shall be established that he swore falsely, beyond the penalty for perjury, let him be deprived of both benefices and be perpetually incapable of obtaining any benefice whatsoever.\n\n§2. On the Register of Benefices:\n\nIn every diocese, the ordinary shall be bound to have a register of all benefices with cure of souls and all benefices with residence, in which shall be noted the names of holders, the day of collation, and the annual value of the benefice.\n\nThis register shall be renewed each year and transmitted to the supervisory commission instituted below.\n\n§3. On the Supervisory Commission:\n\nWe confirm and renew the supervisory commission instituted in the decree on concubinage, and extend its power to take cognizance of the observance of this decree on plurality of benefices.\n\nTo this commission, ordinaries shall send each year a report on the state of their dioceses regarding plurality of benefices, and concerning cases of dispensations granted with expression of the causes.\n\n§4. On Penalties for Collators:\n\nCollators who shall have conferred benefices contrary to the form of this decree, if they are bishops, shall be suspended from the collation of benefices for two years; if they are inferiors, they shall be deprived of the right of conferring that benefice for that turn, and the benefice shall devolve to the superior.\n\nIf however they shall have knowingly and deceitfully conferred a benefice contrary to this decree, beyond the aforesaid penalties, they shall incur the sentence of excommunication, from which they cannot be absolved except by this holy synod or by the Roman pontiff.\n\nSECTION I: TRANSITION PERIOD\n\nLatin Text\n\nArticulus Nonus: De Tempore Transitionis\n\nAd ordinatam executionem huius decreti, sequentes terminos statuimus:\n\n§1. Clerici qui ante publicationem huius decreti plura beneficia sine dispensatione obtinebant, habent spatium sex mensium a die publicationis in singulis dioecesibus computandorum, ad se reducendum ad formam iuris, id est ad resignandum omnia beneficia praeter unum cum cura vel tria sine cura.\n\n§2. Infra praedictum terminum, possunt libere eligere quae beneficia retinere velint et quae resignare.\n\n§3. Post praedictum terminum, qui se non reduxerit, omnibus beneficiis suis ipso iure privatus existat, et ad nulla beneficia per quinquennium sit habilis.\n\n§4. Ordinarii locorum tenentur, infra annum a publicatione huius decreti, conficere registra de quibus supra, et ad commissionem supervisoriam transmittere.\n\nEnglish Translation\n\nArticle Nine: On the Transition Period\n\nFor the orderly execution of this decree, we establish the following terms:\n\n§1. Clerics who before the publication of this decree held several benefices without dispensation, have a space of six months to be computed from the day of publication in each diocese, to reduce themselves to the form of law, that is, to resign all benefices except one with cure or three without cure.\n\n§2. Within the aforesaid term, they can freely choose which benefices they wish to retain and which to resign.\n\n§3. After the aforesaid term, he who shall not have reduced himself shall exist deprived of all his benefices by the law itself, and shall be capable of no benefices for five years.\n\n§4. Ordinaries of places are bound, within a year from the publication of this decree, to draw up the registers spoken of above, and to transmit them to the supervisory commission.\n\nPART V: SANCTIO - ENFORCEMENT CLAUSE\n\nLatin Text\n\nNulli ergo omnino hominum liceat hanc paginam nostrae constitutionis, definitionis, statuti, mandati, praecepti et voluntatis infringere, vel ei ausu temerario contraire.\n\nSi quis autem hoc attemptare praesumpserit, indignationem omnipotentis Dei et beatorum Petri et Pauli apostolorum eius se noverit incursurum.\n\nPraeterea, omnes constitutiones, privilegia, indulta, exemptiones, et dispensationes quascumque, quae huic decreto in aliquo adversantur, etiam si de eis specialis mentio facienda esset, penitus revocamus et annullamus, et pro revocatis et annullatis haberi volumus.\n\nDecernimus insuper, ut haec constitutio in omnibus ecclesiis cathedralibus singulis annis in synodo dioecesana publice legatur, ut nullus ignorantiam praetendere possit.\n\nOrdinariis locorum, sub poena suspensionis ab ingressu ecclesiae per sex menses, praecipimus, ut infra sex menses a die publicationis huius decreti in hac sancta synodo, illud in suis dioecesibus publicent et executioni demandent.\n\nEnglish Translation\n\nLet it therefore be permitted to absolutely no man to infringe this document of our constitution, definition, statute, mandate, precept and will, or with rash daring to contravene it.\n\nIf anyone however shall presume to attempt this, let him know that he shall incur the indignation of almighty God and of the blessed Peter and Paul his apostles.\n\nFurthermore, all constitutions, privileges, indults, exemptions, and dispensations whatsoever, which are in any way contrary to this decree, even if special mention of them should be made, we utterly revoke and annul, and we will them to be held as revoked and annulled.\n\nWe decree furthermore, that this constitution shall be publicly read in all cathedral churches each year in the diocesan synod, so that no one may be able to pretend ignorance.\n\nWe command the ordinaries of places, under penalty of suspension from entrance to the church for six months, that within six months from the day of publication of this decree in this holy synod, they publish it in their dioceses and commit it to execution.\n\nPART VI: APPROBATIO & SUBSCRIPTIONES\n\nLatin

eis cognosci, gratias agit aeterno Deo omnipotenti, qui dedit nobis gratiam hanc legem statuendi ad salutem animarum et ad reformationem disciplinae ecclesiasticae.\n\nInvocamus super hoc decretum benedictionem Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti, et intercessionem beatissimae Virginis Mariae et omnium sanctorum, praesertim sanctorum pastorum qui greges suos usque ad sanguinem fideliter paverunt.\n\nRogamus omnes praelatos, collatores, et patronos beneficiorum, ut hoc decretum fideliter observent, memores illius verbi Domini per prophetam Ezechielem: \"Vae pastoribus Israel, qui pascebant semetipsos! Nonne greges a pastoribus pascuntur?\"\n\nEt rogamus omnes clericos, ut non quaerant pluralitatem beneficiorum propter avaritiam vel ambitionem, sed contenti sint uno beneficio secundum apostolum dicentem: \"Habentes alimenta et quibus tegamur, his contenti simus.\"\n\nAmen. Fiat, fiat, fiat.\n\nEnglish Translation\n\nThanks be to God\n\nThis holy synod of Basel, considering that the cure of souls is the supreme law of the church, and that the shepherd ought to know his sheep and be known by them, gives thanks to the eternal almighty God, who gave us the grace to establish this law for the salvation of souls and for the reformation of ecclesiastical discipline.\n\nWe invoke upon this decree the blessing of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, and the intercession of the most blessed Virgin Mary and of all the saints, especially the holy shepherds who faithfully fed their flocks even unto blood.\n\nWe ask all prelates, collators, and patrons of benefices, that they faithfully observe this decree, mindful of that word of the Lord through the prophet Ezekiel: \"Woe to the shepherds of Israel, who fed themselves! Should not the flocks be fed by the shepherds?\"\n\nAnd we ask all clerics, that they not seek plurality of benefices through avarice or ambition, but be content with one benefice according to the apostle saying: \"Having food and covering, with these let us be content.\"\n\nAmen. Let it be done, let it be done, let it be done.\n\nFINIS DECRETI\n\nEND OF DECREE\n\nHistorical Note\n\nThis decree represents the Council of Basel's Session 16 (September 28, 1433), passed during the period of accelerated reform following the arrival of Emperor Sigismund and the reception of the Declaration of Como. In the standard historical timeline, Basel addressed pluralism gradually through various decrees, with the major reform coming on June 9, 1435 (Session 21). In this alternate timeline, the energizing effect of the Imperial-Castilian alliance allowed earlier and more comprehensive action.\n\nThe decree builds upon the Fourth Lateran Council's Canon 29 (1215), which had prohibited pluralism but was undermined by easy papal dispensations. The key innovations of this Basel decree are:\n\n1. Grandfathering with sunset: Existing legitimate pluralists can keep their benefices for life, but the arrangements cannot be renewed—ensuring gradual reform without immediate chaos.\n\n2. Closing the dispensation loophole: Dispensations are now granted by ordinaries, not Rome, and only for three narrow causes. This addresses the central failure of all previous anti-pluralism legislation.\n\n3. Cardinal restriction: Limiting cardinals to one bishopric was extremely controversial but reflected Basel's anti-curial sentiment.\n\n4. Benefice registers: Creating diocesan databases of all benefices and their holders enables systematic enforcement.\n\n5. Supervisory commission: Extending the same oversight body from the concubinage decree creates institutional continuity.\n\nThe Latin text employs technical vocabulary and formulaic expressions characteristic of Basel's decrees. The English translation preserves the formal, precise character of medieval ecclesiastical legislation.\n\nThe inclusion of Bishop Alfonso de Cartagena among the signatories reflects the Castilian delegation's prominent role in reform efforts at Basel.\n\nDocument Length: Approximately 20 pages in standard formatting.\n\nEND OF DOCUMENT",

Ecclesia Dei indiget subsidiis temporalibus ad exercenda opera spiritualia: ad cultum divinum celebrandum, ad evangelium praedicandum, ad pauperes sustentandos, ad haeresim extirpandam, ad unitatem fidei conservandam.\n\nNec reprehendendum est quod ministri ecclesiae stipendia accipiant pro laboribus suis, cum Apostolus dicat: \"Qui altari deserviunt, de altari participantur,\" et iterum: \"Dignus est operarius mercede sua.\" Ipsa sedes apostolica, quae totius Christianitatis curam gerit, indiget pecuniis ad tot et tantas necessitates providendum.\n\nVerum tamen ea quae iuste et moderate exiguntur, cum excedunt modum, in iniuriam et oppressionem vertuntur. Conqueruntur enim multi praelati et clerici, quod taxae quae super beneficiis ecclesiasticis imponuntur, adeo graves et onerosae factae sint, ut beneficiati saepe non possint de residuo fructuum suorum vivere honeste, nec ecclesias suas decenter sustentare.\n\nConqueruntur praeterea, quod modus exigendi harum taxarum obscurus sit et incertus, et quod diversi exactores diversas summas petant, et quod nulla ratio reddatur de pecuniis collectis, et quod gravamina inferantur his qui solvere non possunt.\n\nNos igitur, qui volumus ut ecclesia Dei habeat necessaria subsidia sine iniuria subditorum, et ut taxationes sint certae et moderatae et manifeste ordinatae, de consilio et assensu huius sacri concilii, praesentem constitutionem edimus, per quam antiquas exactiones reformamus, novas ordinationes statuimus, et tam capiti quam membris iustitiam facere intendimus.\n\nEnglish Translation\n\nWhen our Lord Jesus Christ said to the Pharisees: \"Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's,\" he taught us that both spiritual and temporal things are to be disposed according to due order. The church of God needs temporal subsidies to exercise spiritual works: to celebrate divine worship, to preach the gospel, to sustain the poor, to extirpate heresy, to preserve the unity of the faith.\n\nNor is it to be reproved that ministers of the church receive stipends for their labors, since the Apostle says: \"They who serve the altar share in the altar,\" and again: \"The laborer is worthy of his wages.\" The apostolic see itself, which bears the care of all Christendom, needs monies to provide for so many and such great necessities.\n\nNevertheless, those things which are justly and moderately exacted, when they exceed measure, are turned into injury and oppression. For many prelates and clerics complain that the taxes which are imposed on ecclesiastical benefices have become so heavy and burdensome that benefice-holders often cannot live honorably from the remainder of their fruits, nor decently sustain their churches.\n\nThey complain moreover that the manner of exacting these taxes is obscure and uncertain, and that different exactors demand different sums, and that no account is rendered of the monies collected, and that grievances are inflicted on those who cannot pay.\n\nWe therefore, who wish that the church of God may have necessary subsidies without injury to its subjects, and that taxations may be certain and moderate and manifestly ordered, with the counsel and assent of this sacred council, issue the present constitution, by which we reform the ancient exactions, decree new ordinances, and intend to do justice both to head and to members.\n\nPART III: NARRATIO - HISTORICAL CIRCUMSTANCES\n\nLatin Text\n\nCum per longam consuetudinem et diversas constitutiones apostolicas introductae fuerint variae taxae et exactiones super beneficiis ecclesiasticis, quae communiter \"annatae\" vocantur, quarum principales sunt:\n\nPrimo, servitia communia, quae solvuntur Camerae Apostolicae et Collegio Cardinalium a praelatis maioribus, videlicet archiepiscopis, episcopis, et abbatibus, super eorum confirmatione vel translatione, et quae taxantur secundum antiquas aestimationes ad unius anni integri fructus;\n\nSecundo, servitia minuta, quae solvuntur diversis officialibus Curiae Romanae pro expeditione litterarum et aliis servitiis, ultra servitia communia;\n\nTertio, annatae proprie dictae, quae solvuntur de beneficiis minoribus a sede apostolica collatis vel confirmatis, et quae taxantur ad medietatem fructuum primi anni;\n\nQuarto, quindennia, quae solvuntur de beneficiis perpetuo unitis, singulis quindecim annis;\n\nEt cum hae taxae olim moderate introductae fuerint, sed procedente tempore per augmentationem taxarum et multiplicationem exactorum, in grave onus cleri et scandalum populi Christiani conversae sint;\n\nEt cum Concilium Constantiense in concordatis cum diversis nationibus factis, aliquas moderationes induxerit, sed non sufficientes ad tollendum omnia gravamina;\n\nEt cum multi clamores ad hanc sanctam synodum pervenerint de excessivis exactionibus, de incertitudine taxarum, de obscuritate computationum, et de defectu iustitiae in causis appellationum;\n\nNos, considerantes quod reformatio capitis et membrorum ab hac sancta synodo intenta, incipere debet a moderatione eorum quae onus clero imponunt, sequentes constitutiones statuimus et decernimus inviolabiliter observandas.\n\nEnglish Translation\n\nWhereas through long custom and diverse apostolic constitutions there have been introduced various taxes and exactions on ecclesiastical benefices, which are commonly called \"annates,\" the principal of which are:\n\nFirst, the servitia communia, which are paid to the Apostolic Camera and the College of Cardinals by major prelates, namely archbishops, bishops, and abbots, upon their confirmation or translation, and which are assessed according to ancient valuations at one full year's fruits;\n\nSecond, the servitia minuta, which are paid to various officials of the Roman Curia for the expedition of letters and other services, beyond the servitia communia;\n\nThird, the annates properly so called, which are paid on minor benefices collated or confirmed by the apostolic see, and which are assessed at half the fruits of the first year;\n\nFourth, the quindennia, which are paid on benefices perpetually united, every fifteen years;\n\nAnd whereas these taxes were once moderately introduced, but as time proceeded, through augmentation of assessments and multiplication of exactors, have been converted into a heavy burden on the clergy and a scandal to the Christian people;\n\nAnd whereas the Council of Constance in concordats made with various nations introduced some moderations, but not sufficient to remove all grievances;\n\nAnd whereas many outcries have come to this holy synod concerning excessive exactions, concerning uncertainty of assessments, concerning obscurity of accountings, and concerning defect of justice in causes of appeals;\n\nWe, considering that the reformation of head and members intended by this holy synod ought to begin from the moderation of those things which impose a burden on the clergy, decree and determine the following constitutions to be inviolably observed.\n\nPART IV: DISPOSITIO - LEGAL PROVISIONS\n\nSECTION A: REDUCTION OF RATES\n\nLatin Text\n\nArticulus Primus: De Reductione Servitii Communis\n\nStatuimus et ordinamus, quod de cetero servitia communia non excedant quartam partem fructuum primi anni beneficii, secundum aestimationem de qua infra dicetur.\n\n§1. Ubi antiquae taxationes in libris Camerae Apostolicae servitium commune ad unius anni integri fructus taxabant, de cetero non exigatur nisi quarta pars illius summae, id est, ubi taxabatur ad centum florenos, nunc taxetur ad viginti quinque florenos.\n\n§2. Haec reductio applicetur tam ad archiepiscopatus et episcopatus, quam ad abbatias et prioratus conventuales qui in consistorio conferuntur.\n\n§3. Servitia communia dividantur sicut antea, videlicet medietate ad Cameram Apostolicam et medietate ad Collegium Cardinalium.\n\n§4. Praelati qui propter paupertatem ecclesiarum suarum solvere non possunt etiam quartam partem, possint petere moderationem ab ordinario metropolitano, qui cum consilio duorum suffraganeorum, possit reducere taxam usque ad octavam partem, vel etiam totaliter remittere si vera paupertas probetur.\n\nEnglish Translation\n\nArticle One: On the Reduction of the Common Service\n\nWe decree and ordain that henceforth the servitia communia shall not exceed a fourth part of the first year's fruits of the benefice, according to the valuation spoken of below.\n\n§1. Where ancient assessments in the books of the Apostolic Camera taxed the common service at one full year's fruits, henceforth let not more than a fourth part of that sum be exacted, that is, where it was taxed at one hundred florins, let it now be taxed at twenty-five florins.\n\n§2. This reduction shall apply both to archbishoprics and bishoprics, and to abbacies and conventual priories which are conferred in consistory.\n\n§3. The servitia communia shall be divided as before, namely half to the Apostolic Camera and half to the College of Cardinals.\n\n§4. Prelates who on account of the poverty of their churches cannot pay even a fourth part, can petition for moderation from the metropolitan ordinary, who with the counsel of two suffragans, can reduce the tax down to an eighth part, or even remit it totally if true poverty is proven.\n\nLatin Text (continued)\n\nArticulus Secundus: De Reductione Annatarum Proprie Dictarum\n\nSimiliter statuimus, quod annatae proprie dictae, quae solvuntur de beneficiis minoribus a sede apostolica collatis, non excedant quartam partem fructuum primi anni.\n\n§1. Ubi antea exigebatur medietas fructuum primi anni, de cetero non exigatur nisi quarta pars.\n\n§2. Beneficia quorum fructus annui non excedunt viginti quatuor florenos auri de camera, omnino libera sint ab annatis, sicut per Concordatum Constantiense statutum fuit.\n\n§3. Beneficia quorum fructus annui excedunt viginti quatuor florenos sed non excedunt quinquaginta florenos, solvant tantummodo decem florenos fixos, non quartam partem.\n\n§4. Beneficia quorum fructus annui excedunt quinquaginta florenos, solvant quartam partem secundum veram aestimationem fructuum, non secundum antiquas taxationes inflatas.\n\nEnglish Translation (continued)\n\nArticle Two: On the Reduction of Annates Properly So Called\n\nSimilarly we decree that annates properly so called, which are paid on minor benefices collated by the apostolic see, shall not exceed a fourth part of the first year's fruits.\n\n§1. Where formerly half the first year's fruits were exacted, henceforth let not more than a fourth part be exacted.\n\n§2. Benefices whose annual fruits do not exceed twenty-four gold florins of the camera shall be entirely free from annates, as was decreed by the Concordat of Constance.\n\n§3. Benefices whose annual fruits exceed twenty-four florins but do not exceed fifty florins, shall pay only ten fixed florins, not a fourth part.\n\n§4. Benefices whose annual fruits exceed fifty florins shall pay a fourth part according to the true valuation of the fruits, not according to inflated ancient assessments.\n\nSECTION B: REFORM OF MINOR SERVICES\n\nLatin Text\n\nArticulus Tertius: De Servitiis Minutis et Aliis Expensis\n\nQuoniam servitia minuta et aliae expensae quae ultra servitia communia exiguntur, multiplicatae sunt in grave onus praelatorum, statuimus:\n\n§1. Servitia minuta, quae solvuntur camerariis, notariis, scriptoribus, et aliis officialibus Curiae, omnino aboleantur. Officiales Curiae de cetero recipiant stipendia fixa a Camera Apostolica, non propinas a praelatis.\n\n§2. Pro expeditione bullarum et litterarum apostolicarum, non exigatur ultra iustas expensas pergameni, scripturae, et sigilli, quae expensae in tabulis publicis affixis in Camera Apostolica declarentur.\n\n§3. Nullus officialis Curiae possit exigere vel recipere aliquod donum, munus, vel gratificationem a praelato vel beneficiato, ultra ea quae in tabulis publicis taxantur, sub poena privationis officii et restitutionis dupli.\n\n§4. Si quis praelatus vel beneficiatus coactus fuerit ad solvendum ultra taxas publice ordinatas, habeat actionem recuperandi duplum contra exactorem coram auditore Camerae, absque ulteriori appellatione.\n\nEnglish Translation\n\nArticle Three: On Minor Services and Other Expenses\n\nSince the minor services and other expenses which are exacted beyond the common services have been multiplied into a heavy burden on prelates, we decree:\n\n§1. The servitia minuta, which are paid to chamberlains, notaries, scribes, and other officials of the Curia, shall be entirely abolished. Officials of the Curia shall henceforth receive fixed stipends from the Apostolic Camera, not tips from prelates.\n\n§2. For the expedition of bulls and apostolic letters, let not more be exacted than the just expenses of parchment, writing, and seal, which expenses shall be declared in public tables affixed in the Apostolic Camera.\n\n§3. No official of the Curia can exact or receive any gift, present, or gratification from a prelate or benefice-holder, beyond those things which are assessed in the public tables, under penalty of deprivation of office and restitution of double.\n\n§4. If any prelate or benefice-holder has been compelled to pay beyond the publicly ordained taxes, he shall have an action to recover double against the exactor before the auditor of the Camera, without further appeal.\n\nSECTION C: NEW VALUATION SYSTEM\n\nLatin Text\n\nArticulus Quartus: De Nova Aestimatione Beneficiorum\n\nQuoniam antiquae taxationes in libris Camerae Apostolicae saepe non correspondent veris fructibus beneficiorum, sed sunt vel nimis altae propter antiquitatem, vel nimis bassae propter corruptionem, ordinamus novam aestimationem fieri:\n\n§1. Intra quinquennium a publicatione huius decreti, in qualibet provincia ecclesiastica fiat nova aestimatio omnium beneficiorum quae servitiis communibus vel annatis subiiciuntur.\n\n§2. Haec aestimatio fiat per metropolitanum cum duobus suffraganeis a synodo provinciali electis, qui iuramento astringantur ad aestimandos veros fructus beneficiorum secundum communem cursum decem annorum praecedentium, deductis oneribus ordinariis.\n\n§3. Aestimationes sic factae transmittantur ad Cameram Apostolicam et ad commissionem supervisoriam huius sacri concilii, et publicentur in libris impressis vel manuscriptis, ut omnibus notae sint.\n\n§4. Post publicationem novarum aestimationum, antiquae taxationes nullam vim habeant, et servitia communia et annatae secundum novas aestimationes tantummodo exigantur.\n\n§5. Si Camera Apostolica vel aliquis exactor exigat secundum antiquas taxationes post novas aestimationes publicatas, beneficiatus non teneatur solvere nisi secundum novam aestimationem, et exactor incurrat poenas articuli praecedentis.\n\nEnglish Translation\n\nArticle Four: On the New Valuation of Benefices\n\nSince the ancient assessments in the books of the Apostolic Camera often do not correspond to the true fruits of benefices, but are either too high on account of their age, or too low on account of corruption, we ordain a new valuation to be made:\n\n§1. Within five years from the publication of this decree, in every ecclesiastical province let a new valuation be made of all benefices which are subject to common services or annates.\n\n§2. This valuation shall be made by the metropolitan with two suffragans elected by the provincial synod, who shall be bound by oath to value the true fruits of benefices according to the common course of the ten preceding years, with ordinary burdens deducted.\n\n§3. Valuations so made shall be transmitted to the Apostolic Camera and to the supervisory commission of this sacred council, and shall be published in printed or manuscript books, so that they may be known to all.\n\n§4. After the publication of the new valuations, the ancient assessments shall have no force, and common services and annates shall be exacted only according to the new valuations.\n\n§5. If the Apostolic Camera or any exactor exacts according to ancient assessments after the new valuations have been published, the benefice-holder shall not be bound to pay except according to the new valuation, and the exactor shall incur the penalties of the preceding article.\n\nSECTION D: TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY\n\nLatin Text\n\nArticulus Quintus: De Ratione Reddenda a Camera Apostolica\n\nAd tollendum scandalum quod oritur ex eo quod nemo scit quid fiat de pecuniis quae a clero exiguntur, statuimus de rationibus Camerae Apostolicae publicandis:\n\n§1. Camera Apostolica teneatur singulis annis, infra mensem Ianuarium, conficere rationem generalem omnium introituum et exituum anni praecedentis.\n\n§2. Haec ratio generalis contineat distincte:\n- Quantum receptum sit de servitiis communibus, et a quibus praelatis;\n- Quantum receptum sit de annatis, et de quibus beneficiis;\n- Quantum receptum sit de quindenniis;\n- Quantum receptum sit de aliis fontibus, ut censu, visitationibus, et similibus;\n- Quantum expositum sit pro administratione Curiae Romanae;\n- Quantum expositum sit pro defensione fidei et ecclesiae;\n- Quantum expositum sit pro eleemosynis et piis operibus;\n- Quantum remaneat in aerario.\n\n§3. Haec ratio transmittatur ad commissionem supervisoriam huius sacri concilii, et summarium eius publicetur, ut clerici sciant quo eorum pecuniae eant.\n\n§4. Si Camera Apostolica per duos annos continuos negligat transmittere rationes, hoc sacrum concilium vel eius commissio supervisoria possit suspendere collectionem annatarum donec rationes reddantur.\n\nEnglish Translation\n\nArticle Five: On the Account to be Rendered by the Apostolic Camera\n\nTo remove the scandal which arises from the fact that no one knows what is done with the monies which are exacted from the clergy, we decree concerning the accounts of the Apostolic Camera to be published:\n\n§1. The Apostolic Camera shall be bound each year, within the month of January, to draw up a general account of all receipts and expenditures of the preceding year.\n\n§2. This general account shall contain distinctly:\n- How much was received from common services, and from which prelates;\n- How much was received from annates, and from which benefices;\n- How much was received from quindennia;\n- How much was received from other sources, such as census, visitations, and the like;\n- How much was expended for the administration of the Roman Curia;\n- How much was expended for the defense of the faith and the church;\n- How much was expended for alms and pious works;\n- How much remains in the treasury.\n\n§3. This account shall be transmitted to the supervisory commission of this sacred council, and a summary of it shall be published, so that clerics may know where their monies go.\n\n§4. If the Apostolic Camera for two continuous years neglects to transmit accounts, this sacred council or its supervisory commission can suspend the collection of annates until accounts are rendered.\n\nSECTION E: RIGHT OF APPEAL\n\nLatin Text\n\nArticulus Sextus: De Iure Appellandi in Causis Annatarum\n\nQuoniam multi praelati et beneficiati conqueruntur quod non habent remedium contra iniustas exactiones, quia exactores sunt simul iudices in propriis causis, statuimus de appellationibus:\n\n§1. Si quis praelatus vel beneficiatus se gravatum sentit de taxatione imposita super suo beneficio, possit appellare ad auditorem generalem Camerae Apostolicae, qui teneatur infra triginta dies cognoscere de causa et iustitiam facere.\n\n§2. Si appellans non sit satisfactus de sententia auditoris Camerae, possit ulterius appellare ad commissionem supervisoriam huius sacri concilii, quae habeat potestatem finaliter decidendi causam, absque ulteriori recursu ad quemcumque.\n\n§3. Pendente appellatione, praelatus vel beneficiatus teneatur solvere tantummodo illam partem taxae de qua non est controversia; de parte controversa non cogatur solvere donec causa decidatur.\n\n§4. Si appellans obtineat in toto vel in parte, exactor condemnetur ad restituendum quod iniuste exegit, cum expensis litis.\n\n§5. Nullus praelatus vel beneficiatus possit cogi ad iurandum de non appellando, vel ad renuntiandum iuri appellationis, sub poena nullitatis talis iuramenti vel renuntiationis.\n\nEnglish Translation\n\nArticle Six: On the Right of Appeal in Causes of Annates\n\nSince many prelates and benefice-holders complain that they have no remedy against unjust exactions, because the exactors are at the same time judges in their own causes, we decree concerning appeals:\n\n§1. If any prelate or benefice-holder feels himself aggrieved by the assessment imposed on his benefice, he can appeal to the auditor general of the Apostolic Camera, who shall be bound within thirty days to take cognizance of the cause and do justice.\n\n§2. If the appellant is not satisfied with the sentence of the auditor of the Camera, he can further appeal to the supervisory commission of this sacred council, which shall have power to finally decide the cause, without further recourse to anyone.\n\n§3. Pending appeal, the prelate or benefice-holder shall be bound to pay only that part of the tax about which there is no controversy; concerning the controverted part he shall not be compelled to pay until the cause is decided.\n\n§4. If the appellant prevails in whole or in part, the exactor shall be condemned to restore what he unjustly exacted, with costs of suit.\n\n§5. No prelate or benefice-holder can be compelled to swear not to appeal, or to renounce the right of appeal, under penalty of nullity of such oath or renunciation.\n\nSECTION F: PAYMENT TERMS\n\nLatin Text\n\nArticulus Septimus: De Modo et Tempore Solutionis\n\nQuoniam multi praelati, praesertim pauperes, non possunt statim solvere servitia communia, et coguntur contrahere debita cum usuris, statuimus de modo solutionis:\n\n§1. Servitia communia possint solvi in duabus partibus aequalibus: prima medietas infra sex menses a confirmatione, secunda medietas infra annum a confirmatione.\n\n§2. Si praelatus propter iustas causas non possit solvere infra praedictos terminos, possit petere dilationem ab ordinario metropolitano, qui possit concedere dilationem usque ad duos annos, dummodo praelatus det cautionem idoneam.\n\n§3. Nulla usura vel interesse possit exigi pro dilatione solutionis, dummodo praelatus solvat infra terminum concessum.\n\n§4. Si praelatus non solvat infra terminum concessum absque iusta causa, tunc demum possit suspendi ab administratione temporalium sui beneficii, sed non a spiritualibus, donec solvat.\n\n§5. Annatae de beneficiis minoribus possint solvi infra sex menses a collatione, absque ulla usura.\n\nEnglish Translation\n\nArticle Seven: On the Manner and Time of Payment\n\nSince many prelates, especially poor ones, cannot immediately pay the common services, and are compelled to contract debts with usury, we decree concerning the manner of payment:\n\n§1. Common services can be paid in two equal parts: the first half within six months of confirmation, the second half within one year of confirmation.\n\n§2. If a prelate on account of just causes cannot pay within the aforesaid terms, he can petition for delay from the metropolitan ordinary, who can grant a delay up to two years, provided the prelate gives suitable security.\n\n§3. No usury or interest can be exacted for delay of payment, provided the prelate pays within the granted term.\n\n§4. If the prelate does not pay within the granted term without just cause, then and only then can he be suspended from the administration of the temporalities of his benefice, but not from spiritualities, until he pays.\n\n§5. Annates on minor benefices can be paid within six months of collation, without any usury.\n\nSECTION G: QUINDENNIA\n\nLatin Text\n\nArticulus Octavus: De Quindenniis\n\nDe quindenniis, quae solvuntur de beneficiis perpetuo unitis, statuimus:\n\n§1. Quindennia de cetero non exigantur nisi de beneficiis quorum unio facta est auctoritate apostolica, et quorum fructus uniti excedunt quinquaginta florenos annuos.\n\n§2. Quindennia taxentur ad decimam partem fructuum unius anni beneficii uniti, non ad quartam partem sicut annatae ordinariae.\n\n§3. Uniones factae pro sustentando collegia, hospitalia, monasteria pauperum, vel alia pia opera, omnino exemptae sint a quindenniis.\n\n§4. Si dubium sit an unio subiaceat quindenniis, beneficiatus possit petere declarationem a commissione supervisoria, cuius decisio sit finalis.\n\nEnglish Translation\n\nArticle Eight: On Quindennia\n\nConcerning quindennia, which are paid on benefices perpetually united, we decree:\n\n§1. Quindennia shall henceforth not be exacted except from benefices whose union was made by apostolic authority, and whose united fruits exceed fifty annual florins.\n\n§2. Quindennia shall be assessed at a tenth part of the fruits of one year of the united benefice, not at a fourth part like ordinary annates.\n\n§3. Unions made for sustaining colleges, hospitals, monasteries of the poor, or other pious works, shall be entirely exempt from quindennia.\n\n§4. If there is doubt whether a union is subject to quindennia, the benefice-holder can petition for a declaration from the supervisory commission, whose decision shall be final.\n\nSECTION H: ENFORCEMENT AND SUPERVISION\n\nLatin Text\n\nArticulus Nonus: De Executione et Supervisione\n\nAd efficacem executionem huius decreti, statuimus:\n\n§1. Commissio supervisoria in decretis de concubinatu et pluralitate instituta, habeat etiam potestatem cognoscendi de observantia huius decreti de annatis.\n\n§2. Camera Apostolica teneatur transmittere ad commissionem supervisoriam:\n- Singulis annis, rationem generalem de qua supra;\n- Singulis trimestris, notitiam de servitiis communibus et annatis exactis, cum nominibus praelatorum et beneficiatorum;\n- Infra quinquennium, novas aestimationes de quibus supra.\n\n§3. Si Camera Apostolica vel eius officiales non observent hoc decretum, commissio supervisoria possit:\n- Monere Cameram de non observantia;\n- Si monitio non proficiat, suspendere collectionem annatarum in una vel pluribus provinciis;\n- Referre causam ad hanc sanctam synodum vel ad Romanum pontificem pro ulteriori remedio.\n\n§4. Ordinarii locorum tenentur publicare hoc decretum in suis dioecesibus, et informare clericos de eorum iuribus secundum hoc decretum, et denuntiare ad commissionem supervisoriam quascumque transgressiones de quibus cognoverint.\n\nEnglish Translation\n\nArticle Nine: On Execution and Supervision\n\nFor the effective execution of this decree, we decree:\n\n§1. The supervisory commission instituted in the decrees on concubinage and plurality shall also have the power of taking cognizance of the observance of this decree on annates.\n\n§2. The Apostolic Camera shall be bound to transmit to the supervisory commission:\n- Each year, the general account spoken of above;\n- Each quarter, a notice of common services and annates exacted, with names of prelates and benefice-holders;\n- Within five years, the new valuations spoken of above.\n\n§3. If the Apostolic Camera or its officials do not observe this decree, the supervisory commission can:\n- Warn the Camera of non-observance;\n- If the warning does not avail, suspend the collection of annates in one or more provinces;\n- Refer the cause to this holy synod or to the Roman pontiff for further remedy.\n\n§4. Ordinaries of places are bound to publish this decree in their dioceses, and to inform clerics of their rights according to this decree, and to denounce to the supervisory commission whatever transgressions of which they become aware.\n\nPART V: SANCTIO - ENFORCEMENT CLAUSE\n\nLatin Text\n\nNulli ergo omnino hominum liceat hanc paginam nostrae constitutionis, reductionis, ordinationis, mandati, et voluntatis infringere, vel ei ausu temerario contraire.\n\nSi quis autem hoc attemptare praesumpserit, praeter poenas in singulis articulis expressas, indignationem omnipotentis Dei et beatorum Petri et Pauli apostolorum eius se noverit incursurum.\n\nOmnes constitutiones, ordinationes, privilegia, indulta, et consuetudines quascumque, quae huic decreto in aliquo adversantur, etiam si de eis specialis mentio facienda esset, penitus revocamus et annullamus quantum ad ea quae huic decreto contrariantur.\n\nMandamus insuper omnibus praelatis, collatoribus, beneficiatis, et officialibus Camerae Apostolicae, ut hoc decretum fideliter observent, sub poenis in singulis articulis expressis.\n\nHoc decretum vim habeat a die publicationis in hac sancta synodo, et applicetur ad omnia servitia communia et annatas quae de cetero exigentur, etiam si beneficia ante hanc diem vacaverint.\n\nEnglish Translation\n\nLet it therefore be permitted to absolutely no man to infringe this document of our constitution, reduction, ordinance, mandate, and will, or with rash daring to contravene it.\n\nIf anyone however shall presume to attempt this, besides the penalties expressed in the individual articles, let him know that he shall incur the indignation of almighty God and of the blessed Peter and Paul his apostles.\n\nAll constitutions, ordinances, privileges, indults, and customs whatsoever, which are in any way contrary to this decree, even if special mention of them should be made, we utterly revoke and annul as far as pertains to those things which are contrary to this decree.\n\nWe command moreover all prelates, collators, benefice-holders, and officials of the Apostolic Camera, that they faithfully observe this decree, under the penalties expressed in the individual articles.\n\nThis decree shall have force from the day of publication in this holy synod, and shall apply to all common services and annates which shall henceforth be exacted, even if benefices became vacant before this day.\n\nPART VI: APPROBATIO & SUBSCRIPTIONES\n\nLatin Text\n\nApprobatio Synodalis\n\nHaec sancta et universalis synodus Basiliensis, in spiritu sancto legitime congregata, universalem ecclesiam representans, praesens decretum de reformatione annatarum et aliarum taxarum papalium super beneficiis, omnibus suis partibus diligenter examinatis et approbatis, in

Gratias\n\nHaec sancta synodus, desiderans iustitiam facere omnibus, tam Romano pontifici qui indiget subsidiis ad gerenda onera universalis ecclesiae, quam praelatis et clericis qui non debent opprimi exactionibus iniustis, gratias agit omnipotenti Deo qui inspiravit hanc viam mediam inter abolitionem totalem annatarum et continuationem abusuum.\n\nNon intendimus spoliare sedem apostolicam iustis subsidiis, sed volumus ut haec subsidia moderata sint et certa et manifesta, ut dantes sciant quantum debent et quo vadant pecuniae eorum.\n\nNon intendimus excusare clericos ab obligatione contribuendi ad necessitates universalis ecclesiae, sed volumus ut contributio sit proportionata facultatibus, et ut via appellationis pateat contra iniustas exactiones.\n\nRogamus sanctissimum dominum nostrum papam ut hanc constitutionem benigne recipiat, non tamquam diminutionem suae auctoritatis, sed tamquam reformationem qua honor sedis apostolicae defenditur ab infamia avidae cupiditatis.\n\nRogamus praelatos et clericos ut fideliter solvant quae secundum hoc decretum debent, nec nitantur per fraudes vel subterfugia eludere iustam contributionem.\n\nIn nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti. Amen.\n\nEnglish Translation\n\nThanks be to God\n\nThis holy synod, desiring to do justice to all, both to the Roman pontiff who needs subsidies to bear the burdens of the universal church, and to prelates and clerics who ought not be oppressed by unjust exactions, gives thanks to almighty God who inspired this middle way between total abolition of annates and continuation of abuses.\n\nWe do not intend to despoil the apostolic see of just subsidies, but we wish that these subsidies be moderate and certain and manifest, so that those giving may know how much they owe and where their monies go.\n\nWe do not intend to excuse clerics from the obligation of contributing to the necessities of the universal church, but we wish that the contribution be proportionate to abilities, and that a way of appeal lie open against unjust exactions.\n\nWe ask our most holy lord the pope that he graciously receive this constitution, not as a diminution of his authority, but as a reform by which the honor of the apostolic see is defended from the infamy of greedy cupidity.\n\nWe ask prelates and clerics that they faithfully pay what they owe according to this decree, and that they not strive through frauds or subterfuges to evade just contribution.\n\nIn the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen.\n\nFINIS DECRETI\n\nEND OF DECREE\n\nHistorical Note\n\nThis decree represents the Council of Basel's Session 17 (October 19, 1433), passed during the period of accelerated reform following the Declaration of Como. In the standard historical timeline, Basel's decree on annates came on June 9, 1435 (Session 21) and abolished annates entirely without providing replacement revenue for the papacy. This radical approach contributed to the breakdown of papal-conciliar relations.\n\nIn this alternate timeline, the moderating influence of the Imperial-Castilian alliance (as expressed in the Como Declaration) produced a more balanced reform:\n\nKey Features of This Decree:\n\n1. Reduction, not abolition: Rates reduced from 50% to 25% of first year's income—a substantial relief but not papal bankruptcy.\n\n2. Transparency requirements: The Apostolic Camera must publish annual accounts showing where the money goes. This addresses the scandal of obscure finances while preserving papal revenue.\n\n3. Right of appeal: For the first time, those assessed have a formal appeals process outside the Camera itself, with final jurisdiction in the conciliar supervisory commission.\n\n4. New valuations: Ancient inflated assessments (some dating to the 13th century) to be replaced by current, realistic valuations within five years.\n\n5. Abolition of minor services: The servitia minuta—tips and gratuities to curial officials—eliminated entirely. Officials to receive fixed salaries instead.\n\n6. Poverty exemptions: Low-income benefices exempt; poor prelates can petition for reduced rates.\n\n7. Payment terms: Installment payments permitted; no usury on delays.\n\nComparison with Historical Basel Decree (1435):\n\n| Issue | Historical Basel (1435) | Alternate Timeline (1433) |\n|-------|------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Basic rate | Abolished entirely | Reduced to 25% |\n| Papal revenue | Devastated | Reduced but sustained |\n| Enforcement | None | Supervisory commission |\n| Appeals | Not addressed | Full appeals system |\n| Transparency | Not addressed | Annual public accounts |\n| Minor services | Abolished | Abolished |\n\nThe alternate timeline decree represents the \"middle way\" that the Como Declaration envisioned: genuine reform that addresses real grievances while maintaining a functional papal administration. This is the kind of reform that a moderate pope like Eugenius IV might actually accept as part of \"parallel legislation.\"\n\nDocument Length: Approximately 18 pages in standard formatting.\n\nEND OF DOCUMENT",

It is not a unilateral decree of the Council, but a bilateral compact—a treaty negotiated between equals.\n\nThe Four Articles of Prague (1420), which formed the basis of Hussite demands, were:\n1. Freedom of preaching the Word of God\n2. Communion in both kinds (sub utraque specie) for laity as well as clergy\n3. Abolition of secular power and worldly possessions of the clergy\n4. Public punishment of mortal sins\n\nAfter months of negotiation at Basel (January-April 1433), at Prague (May-November 1433), and with the moderating influence of Emperor Sigismund and the Imperial-Castilian alliance following the Declaration of Como, agreement was reached on a carefully crafted compromise addressing each article.\n\nPART I: PREAMBLE\n\nLatin Text\n\nIn nomine sanctae et individuae Trinitatis, Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti. Amen.\n\nSacrosancta generalis synodus Basiliensis, in spiritu sancto legitime congregata, universalem ecclesiam representans, ex una parte;\n\nEt illustrissimi principes, barones, nobiles, milites, cives, et communitates regni Bohemiae et marchionatus Moraviae, in dieta generali Pragensi congregati, ex altera parte;\n\nCupientes pacem et unitatem sanctae matris ecclesiae, et finem imponere dissidiis et bellis quae per triginta quinque annos inter catholicos et Bohemos viguerunt, cum ingenti sanguinis effusione et animarum periculo;\n\nInvocato nomine Domini nostri Iesu Christi, qui est pax nostra et fecit utraque unum, et medium parietem maceriae solvens, inimicitias in carne sua interfecit;\n\nPost longam et diligentem tractationem, in qua utrinque proposita sunt argumenta et responsa, et in qua caritas fraternam patientiam exercuit;\n\nDevenerunt ad sequentes articulos concordiae, qui vulgo Compactata appellantur, et qui vim habebunt pacti publici inter partes contrahentes.\n\nEnglish Translation\n\nIn the name of the holy and undivided Trinity, Father and Son and Holy Spirit. Amen.\n\nThe holy general synod of Basel, legitimately assembled in the Holy Spirit, representing the universal church, on one part;\n\nAnd the most illustrious princes, barons, nobles, knights, citizens, and communities of the Kingdom of Bohemia and the Margraviate of Moravia, assembled in the general diet at Prague, on the other part;\n\nDesiring the peace and unity of holy mother church, and to put an end to the dissensions and wars which for thirty-five years have flourished between Catholics and Bohemians, with immense effusion of blood and peril of souls;\n\nHaving invoked the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is our peace and made both one, and breaking down the middle wall of partition, slew enmity in his flesh;\n\nAfter long and diligent negotiation, in which on both sides arguments and responses were set forth, and in which charity exercised fraternal patience;\n\nHave arrived at the following articles of agreement, which are commonly called the Compacts, and which shall have the force of a public pact between the contracting parties.\n\nPART II: THE FOUR ARTICLES\n\nARTICLE I: ON THE COMMUNION IN BOTH KINDS\nDe Communione sub Utraque Specie\n\nLatin Text\n\nPrimus Articulus Concordiae\n\nQuoniam articulus de communione sub utraque specie, id est de administratione sanctissimi sacramenti eucharistiae sub speciebus panis et vini tam clericis quam laicis, fuit praecipua causa dissidii inter ecclesiam et regnum Bohemiae;\n\nEt quoniam haec praxis, quae a temporibus magistri Ioannis Hus in Bohemia et Moravia invaluit, radicem habet in antiqua traditione ecclesiae primitivae, quae per multa saecula utramque speciem omnibus fidelibus communicantibus ministrabat;\n\nSacrosancta synodus Basiliensis, ex potestate sibi a spiritu sancto concessa, de consilio et unanimi assensu legatorum Bohemiae, statuit et concedit:\n\n§1. In regno Bohemiae et marchionatu Moraviae, communio sanctissimi sacramenti eucharistiae sub utraque specie, videlicet sub specie panis et sub specie vini, licite et libere ministrari possit omnibus fidelibus adultis qui eam devote petierint, per sacerdotes rite ordinatos et ab ordinariis locorum approbatos.\n\n§2. Haec concessio fit sine praeiudicio doctrinae catholicae, quae firmiter tenet et docet quod sub qualibet specie totus Christus continetur, videlicet corpus, sanguis, anima et divinitas; ita ut qui sub una specie communicat, nihil minus recipiat quam qui sub utraque.\n\n§3. Nullus tamen cogatur communicare sub utraque specie qui sub una tantum communicare voluerit; et in aliis regionibus ecclesiae, ubi usus communionis sub una specie viget, idem usus servetur.\n\n§4. Pueri ante annos discretionis non admittantur ad communionem sub specie vini, ne forte ex fragilitate aetatis sacramentum effundant; sed ubi parentes vel parochi iudicaverint pueros sufficientem discretionem attigisse, tunc possint sub utraque specie communicare.\n\n§5. Sacerdotes qui hanc communionem ministrant, tenentur instruere fideles de veritate praedicta, videlicet quod totus Christus sub utraque specie continetur, et quod usus communionis sub una specie in aliis regionibus ecclesiae non est error sed legitima consuetudo.\n\n§6. Vasa sacra pro administratione calicis laicis, et modus ministrandi, ordinentur secundum regulas quas ordinarii locorum, de consilio synodorum provincialium, statuerint, ad decentiam et reverentiam sacramenti conservandam.\n\nEnglish Translation\n\nFirst Article of Agreement\n\nSince the article on communion in both kinds, that is, on the administration of the most holy sacrament of the Eucharist under the species of both bread and wine to clerics and laity alike, was the principal cause of dissension between the church and the Kingdom of Bohemia;\n\nAnd since this practice, which prevailed in Bohemia and Moravia from the times of Master John Hus, has its root in the ancient tradition of the primitive church, which for many centuries ministered both species to all the faithful communicating;\n\nThe holy synod of Basel, from the power granted to it by the Holy Spirit, with the counsel and unanimous assent of the legates of Bohemia, decrees and grants:\n\n§1. In the Kingdom of Bohemia and the Margraviate of Moravia, communion of the most holy sacrament of the Eucharist under both species, namely under the species of bread and under the species of wine, may be lawfully and freely ministered to all adult faithful who devoutly request it, by priests duly ordained and approved by the ordinaries of the places.\n\n§2. This concession is made without prejudice to Catholic doctrine, which firmly holds and teaches that under either species the whole Christ is contained, namely body, blood, soul and divinity; so that one who communicates under one species receives nothing less than one who communicates under both.\n\n§3. Nevertheless, no one shall be compelled to communicate under both species who wishes to communicate under one only; and in other regions of the church, where the usage of communion under one species flourishes, the same usage shall be observed.\n\n§4. Children before the years of discretion shall not be admitted to communion under the species of wine, lest perchance from the fragility of age they spill the sacrament; but where parents or pastors shall have judged that children have attained sufficient discretion, then they may communicate under both species.\n\n§5. Priests who minister this communion are bound to instruct the faithful concerning the aforesaid truth, namely that the whole Christ is contained under both species, and that the usage of communion under one species in other regions of the church is not error but legitimate custom.\n\n§6. The sacred vessels for the administration of the chalice to laypersons, and the manner of ministering, shall be ordained according to the rules which the ordinaries of the places, with the counsel of provincial synods, shall have established, for the preservation of the decency and reverence of the sacrament.\n\nARTICLE II: ON THE FREE PREACHING OF THE WORD OF GOD\nDe Libera Praedicatione Verbi Dei\n\nLatin Text\n\nSecundus Articulus Concordiae\n\nQuoniam Bohemi contendebant quod verbum Dei libere praedicaretur per totum regnum, sine impedimento a potestatibus ecclesiasticis vel secularibus;\n\nEt quoniam ecclesia catholica semper docuit quod praedicatio verbi Dei est officium proprium sacerdotum et praesertim episcoporum, qui habent potestatem mittendi praedicatores et approbandi eorum doctrinam;\n\nAd conciliandam libertatem praedicationis cum ordine ecclesiastico, statuimus:\n\n§1. Verbum Dei licite et libere praedicetur per totum regnum Bohemiae et marchionatum Moraviae, secundum veritatem sacrae scripturae et secundum doctrinam sanctorum patrum et doctorum ecclesiae approbatorum.\n\n§2. Praedicatores tamen debent esse sacerdotes rite ordinati, vel diaconi ab episcopis ad praedicandum missi, vel alii clerici a suis ordinariis specialiter approbati et licentiati.\n\n§3. Praedicatores tenentur praedicare secundum doctrinam ecclesiae catholicae et universalis, non introducentes novitates vel doctrinas contrarias fidei vel bonis moribus, sub poena revocationis licentiae et aliis poenis canonicis.\n\n§4. Episcopi et ordinarii locorum habent potestatem visitandi praedicatores, examinandi eorum doctrinam, et corrigendi errores si qui inventi fuerint, servatis servandis secundum canones.\n\n§5. Si praedicator se gravatum senserit a iudicio ordinarii sui, possit appellare ad metropolitanum, vel ad synodum provincialem, vel ad hanc sanctam synodum vel eius successores.\n\n§6. Praedicatio in lingua vulgari, id est in lingua Bohemica vel Moravica, non prohibetur sed laudatur, ut populus melius intelligat verbum Dei; dummodo praedicator sit idoneus et doctrina sit sana.\n\nEnglish Translation\n\nSecond Article of Agreement\n\nSince the Bohemians contended that the Word of God should be freely preached throughout the whole kingdom, without impediment from ecclesiastical or secular powers;\n\nAnd since the Catholic Church has always taught that the preaching of the Word of God is the proper office of priests and especially of bishops, who have the power of sending preachers and approving their doctrine;\n\nTo reconcile freedom of preaching with ecclesiastical order, we decree:\n\n§1. The Word of God may be lawfully and freely preached throughout the whole Kingdom of Bohemia and Margraviate of Moravia, according to the truth of sacred scripture and according to the doctrine of the holy fathers and approved doctors of the church.\n\n§2. Preachers however must be priests duly ordained, or deacons sent by bishops to preach, or other clerics specially approved and licensed by their ordinaries.\n\n§3. Preachers are bound to preach according to the doctrine of the Catholic and universal church, not introducing novelties or doctrines contrary to faith or good morals, under penalty of revocation of license and other canonical penalties.\n\n§4. Bishops and ordinaries of places have the power of visiting preachers, examining their doctrine, and correcting errors if any are found, observing what should be observed according to the canons.\n\n§5. If a preacher feels himself aggrieved by the judgment of his ordinary, he may appeal to the metropolitan, or to the provincial synod, or to this holy synod or its successors.\n\n§6. Preaching in the vulgar tongue, that is, in the Bohemian or Moravian language, is not prohibited but praised, so that the people may better understand the Word of God; provided the preacher is suitable and the doctrine is sound.\n\nARTICLE III: ON THE SECULAR POSSESSIONS OF THE CLERGY\nDe Possessionibus Saecularibus Clericorum\n\nLatin Text\n\nTertius Articulus Concordiae\n\nQuoniam Bohemi petebant ut clerici non exercerent dominium saeculare, et ut ecclesia reduceretur ad paupertatem apostolicam, sine possessionibus temporalibus;\n\nEt quoniam ecclesia catholica docet quod licet clericis, et ipsi ecclesiae, acquirere et possidere bona temporalia ad sustentationem cultus divini, ministrorum, et pauperum;\n\nConsiderantes quod in hac materia media via tenenda est, ut nec clerici dominentur saeculari potestate, nec ecclesia spolietur necessariis subsidiis;\n\nStatuimus:\n\n§1. Clerici qui per vota religiosa vel per sacros ordines obligati sunt ad vitam spiritualem, non debent exercere officium iudicis saecularis in causis sanguinis, nec personaliter arma portare in bellis, nec principatum mere temporalem gerere.\n\n§2. Tamen clerici et ecclesia possunt licite acquirere, possidere, et administrare bona temporalia, sive immobilia sive mobilia, ad sustentationem cultus divini, fabricae ecclesiarum, ministrorum altaris, hospitalium, scholarum, et pauperum.\n\n§3. Bona ecclesiastica administrentur fideliter et secundum canones, non in luxum vel pompam, sed in usus pios et necessarios; et ratio administrationis reddatur secundum constitutiones huius sacri concilii.\n\n§4. Bona ecclesiastica quae ante has turbas a Bohemis occupata fuerunt, ordinentur secundum conventiones speciales inter partes ineundas, quarum executio committitur serenissimo domino Sigismundo, Romanorum et Hungariae regi, futuro regi Bohemiae.\n\n§5. Possessiones quae iam in manus laicorum transierunt et per longum tempus ab eis possessae sunt, non repetantur, dummodo laici convenientes pensiones ecclesiis solvant pro sustentatione cultus divini in illis locis.\n\n§6. Religiosi qui regulam paupertatis profitentur, eam observent; et monasteria quae a pristino rigore deflexerunt, reformentur secundum constitutiones huius sacri concilii et secundum visitationes ordinariorum.\n\nEnglish Translation\n\nThird Article of Agreement\n\nSince the Bohemians petitioned that clerics should not exercise secular dominion, and that the church should be reduced to apostolic poverty, without temporal possessions;\n\nAnd since the Catholic Church teaches that it is lawful for clerics, and for the church itself, to acquire and possess temporal goods for the sustenance of divine worship, of ministers, and of the poor;\n\nConsidering that in this matter a middle way must be held, so that neither clerics dominate with secular power, nor the church be despoiled of necessary subsidies;\n\nWe decree:\n\n§1. Clerics who by religious vows or by sacred orders are obligated to the spiritual life, ought not to exercise the office of secular judge in cases of blood, nor personally bear arms in wars, nor hold purely temporal principality.\n\n§2. Nevertheless, clerics and the church may lawfully acquire, possess, and administer temporal goods, whether immovable or movable, for the sustenance of divine worship, the fabric of churches, ministers of the altar, hospitals, schools, and the poor.\n\n§3. Ecclesiastical goods shall be administered faithfully and according to the canons, not for luxury or pomp, but for pious and necessary uses; and an account of administration shall be rendered according to the constitutions of this sacred council.\n\n§4. Ecclesiastical goods which before these troubles were occupied by the Bohemians, shall be disposed according to special agreements to be entered into between the parties, the execution of which is committed to the most serene lord Sigismund, King of the Romans and of Hungary, future King of Bohemia.\n\n§5. Possessions which have already passed into the hands of laypeople and have been possessed by them for a long time, shall not be reclaimed, provided the laypeople pay suitable pensions to the churches for the sustenance of divine worship in those places.\n\n§6. Religious who profess a rule of poverty shall observe it; and monasteries which have deflected from their pristine rigor shall be reformed according to the constitutions of this sacred council and according to visitations of ordinaries.\n\nARTICLE IV: ON THE PUNISHMENT OF MORTAL SINS\nDe Punitione Peccatorum Mortalium\n\nLatin Text\n\nQuartus Articulus Concordiae\n\nQuoniam Bohemi petebant ut omnia peccata mortalia, praesertim publica, publice punirentur ab auctoritatibus legitimis, tam clericorum quam laicorum;\n\nEt quoniam ecclesia catholica docet quod distinctio est facienda inter forum internum conscientiae et forum externum iudiciale, et quod non omnia peccata sunt crimina saecularia;\n\nAd conciliandam zelum iustitiae cum ordine iuridico, statuimus:\n\n§1. Omnia peccata mortalia, praesertim publica et notoria, debent puniri ab auctoritatibus legitimis, secundum leges divinas et humanas, ecclesiasticas et civiles.\n\n§2. Peccata clericorum puniantur ab ordinariis locorum et iudicibus ecclesiasticis, secundum sacros canones et constitutiones huius sacri concilii.\n\n§3. Peccata laicorum contra leges civiles puniantur a magistratibus secularibus, secundum leges regni et bonos mores.\n\n§4. Peccata mixti fori, quae sunt simul contra legem Dei et contra leges civiles, possint puniri ab utroque foro, dummodo non sit duplex punitio pro eodem delicto.\n\n§5. Simonia, usura, blasphemia, sacrilegium, et alia peccata quae specialiter offendunt Deum et ecclesiam, severius puniantur secundum gradationem poenalitatis in canonibus expressam.\n\n§6. Ordinarii locorum tenentur visitare dioeceses suas singulis annis, et inquirere de statu cleri et populi, et corrigere quae corrigenda invenerint, et punire delinquentes secundum canones.\n\n§7. Si clericus vel laicus gravatus fuerit per iniustam punitionem, habeat ius appellandi ad superiorem iudicem, servatis servandis.\n\nEnglish Translation\n\nFourth Article of Agreement\n\nSince the Bohemians petitioned that all mortal sins, especially public ones, should be publicly punished by legitimate authorities, whether of clerics or of laypeople;\n\nAnd since the Catholic Church teaches that a distinction must be made between the internal forum of conscience and the external judicial forum, and that not all sins are secular crimes;\n\nTo reconcile zeal for justice with juridical order, we decree:\n\n§1. All mortal sins, especially public and notorious ones, ought to be punished by legitimate authorities, according to divine and human laws, ecclesiastical and civil.\n\n§2. Sins of clerics shall be punished by ordinaries of places and ecclesiastical judges, according to the sacred canons and the constitutions of this sacred council.\n\n§3. Sins of laypeople against civil laws shall be punished by secular magistrates, according to the laws of the kingdom and good morals.\n\n§4. Sins of mixed forum, which are simultaneously against the law of God and against civil laws, may be punished by either forum, provided there is not double punishment for the same offense.\n\n§5. Simony, usury, blasphemy, sacrilege, and other sins which specially offend God and the church, shall be more severely punished according to the gradation of penalty expressed in the canons.\n\n§6. Ordinaries of places are bound to visit their dioceses each year, and to inquire into the state of the clergy and people, and to correct what they find in need of correction, and to punish delinquents according to the canons.\n\n§7. If a cleric or layperson has been aggrieved by unjust punishment, he shall have the right of appealing to a higher judge, observing what should be observed.\n\nPART III: GENERAL PROVISIONS\n\nLatin Text\n\nArticulus Quintus: De Pace et Reconciliatione\n\nPost triginta quinque annos bellorum, cruciatuum, sanguinis et lacrimarum, Deo propitio tandem ad pacem pervenimus. Ideo statuimus:\n\n§1. Pax firma et perpetua sit inter ecclesiam catholicam ex una parte, et regnum Bohemiae et marchionatum Moraviae ex altera parte. Omnes inimicitiae, offensae, et iniuriae praeteritae remittantur et oblivioni tradantur.\n\n§2. Regnum Bohemiae et marchionatus Moraviae recipiantur in communionem sanctae matris ecclesiae, et omnes sententiae excommunicationis, interdicti, et aliae censurae ecclesiasticae, quae contra Bohemos latae fuerunt, revocentur et pro nullis habeantur.\n\n§3. Bohemi et Moravi, qui hos articulos acceptant et promittunt observare, habeantur et tractentur ut veri filii ecclesiae catholicae, et gaudeant omnibus iuribus et privilegiis quibus gaudent alii catholici.\n\n§4. Memor ia magistri Ioannis Hus et Hieronymi Pragensis non damnabitur publice in Bohemia vel Moravia; de veritate vel falsitate doctrinarum eorum iudicium suspendatur, et res committitur futurae discussioni in pace et caritate faciendae.\n\n§5. Serenissimus dominus Sigismundus, Romanorum et Hungariae rex, qui per hos articulos tandem obtinebit coronam Bohemiae, iurat se hos articulos fideliter observaturum et facturum observari per subditos suos.\n\nEnglish Translation\n\nArticle Five: On Peace and Reconciliation\n\nAfter thirty-five years of wars, crusades, blood and tears, by God's favor we have at last arrived at peace. Therefore we decree:\n\n§1. Let there be firm and perpetual peace between the Catholic Church on one part, and the Kingdom of Bohemia and the Margraviate of Moravia on the other part. Let all enmities, offenses, and injuries of the past be forgiven and consigned to oblivion.\n\n§2. Let the Kingdom of Bohemia and the Margraviate of Moravia be received into the communion of holy mother church, and let all sentences of excommunication, interdict, and other ecclesiastical censures, which were issued against the Bohemians, be revoked and held for null.\n\n§3. Bohemians and Moravians, who accept these articles and promise to observe them, shall be held and treated as true sons of the Catholic Church, and shall enjoy all the rights and privileges which other Catholics enjoy.\n\n§4. The memory of Master John Hus and Jerome of Prague shall not be publicly condemned in Bohemia or Moravia; concerning the truth or falsity of their doctrines let judgment be suspended, and the matter is committed to future discussion to be made in peace and charity.\n\n§5. The most serene lord Sigismund, King of the Romans and of Hungary, who through these articles shall at last obtain the crown of Bohemia, swears that he will faithfully observe these articles and cause them to be observed by his subjects.\n\nLatin Text (continued)\n\nArticulus Sextus: De Electione Archiepiscopi Pragensis\n\nQuoniam sedes archiepiscopalis Pragensis diu vacavit, et ordo ecclesiasticus in Bohemia perturbatus est, statuimus:\n\n§1.

The election of the Archbishop of Prague shall be made by the metropolitan chapter and the clergy of Bohemia, according to the canons, and confirmation shall be sought from the apostolic see or from this holy synod.\n\n§2. He who is elected to the archbishopric of Prague shall be a learned man of proven life, acceptable both to the clergy and the people of Bohemia, and a faithful observer of these articles of the compacts.\n\n§3. Until the election and confirmation are completed, the ordination of clerics and other things which pertain to the archbishop shall be exercised by vicars deputed by the provincial synod.\n\n§4. Clerics who during the dissension were ordained by non-Catholic bishops or in an extraordinary manner, shall be examined concerning doctrine and morals, and if they are found suitable, they shall be established in their office by the confirmed archbishop or by his vicars.\n\nLatin Text (continued)\n\nArticulus Septimus: De Taboritis et Aliis Radicis\n\nQuoniam non omnes Bohemi hosce articulos acceptant, sed quidam, praesertim qui Taboritae vocantur, rigidiores conditiones postulant et doctrinam Ioannis Wyclif de eucharistia profitentur;\n\nStatuimus:\n\n§1. Hos articulos compactorum proponimus omnibus Bohemis et Moravis, tam moderatis quam rigorosis, ut eos acceptent et in unitatem ecclesiae redeant.\n\n§2. Qui hos articulos acceptaverint, gaudebunt pace et privilegiis supra expressis.\n\n§3. Qui recusaverint, non cogantur per vim ecclesiasticam vel per cruciatas, sed relinquantur iudicio Dei et reformationi tempore suo venturae.\n\n§4. Si tamen aliqui recusantes per violentiam pacem turbare vel catholicos opprimere conati fuerint, contra eos procedatur per brachio saeculare regni Bohemiae, non per cruciatas exterorum.\n\n§5. Speramus et oramus ut omnes Bohemi tandem unitatem fidei et pacis amplectantur, et ut calix, qui signum divisionis fuit, fiat signum unitatis in Christo.\n\nEnglish Translation (continued)\n\nArticle Seven: On the Taborites and Other Radicals\n\nSince not all Bohemians accept these articles, but some, especially those who are called Taborites, demand more rigid conditions and profess the doctrine of John Wyclif on the Eucharist;\n\nWe decree:\n\n§1. These articles of the compacts we propose to all Bohemians and Moravians, both moderate and rigorous, that they may accept them and return to the unity of the church.\n\n§2. Those who shall have accepted these articles shall enjoy the peace and privileges expressed above.\n\n§3. Those who shall have refused shall not be compelled by ecclesiastical force or by crusades, but shall be left to the judgment of God and to reformation to come in its own time.\n\n§4. If however any who refuse shall have attempted by violence to disturb the peace or oppress Catholics, let proceedings be taken against them by the secular arm of the Kingdom of Bohemia, not by crusades of foreigners.\n\n§5. We hope and pray that all Bohemians may at last embrace the unity of faith and peace, and that the chalice, which was a sign of division, may become a sign of unity in Christ.\n\nPART IV: SIGNATURES

omnes qui transitis per viam, attendite et videte: ecce populus qui in tenebris ambulabat, vidit lucem magnam; et habitantibus in regione umbrae mortis, lux orta est eis.\n\nPer triginta quinque annos Bohemia fuit terra belli et sanguinis. Quinque cruciatae contra eam missae sunt, et omnes in confusione redierunt. Plures quam centum milia animae perierunt in his bellis. Ecclesiae devastatae sunt, monasteria combusta, villae desertae.\n\nEt nunc, non per gladium sed per verbum, non per cruciatas sed per colloquium, pax facta est. Non omnes contenti sunt, non omnes articulos acceptant, sed fundamentum positum est super quod aedificari potest.\n\nRogamus Deum omnipotentem ut hanc pacem conservet et augeat, ut cor lapideum auferat et cor carneum det, ut omnes qui adhuc errant ad veritatem perveniant, et ut ecclesia Bohemiae, quae per tot annos divisa et afflicta fuit, tandem in caritate et unitate refloreat.\n\nSi haec pax duraverit—et oramus ut duret—tempus veniet quando Bohemus et Germanus, Utraquista et Catholicus, simul ad mensam Domini accedent et de uno pane comedent et de uno calice bibent, et omnes cognoscent quod unum sumus in Christo.\n\nGloria Patri et Filio et Spiritui Sancto, sicut erat in principio et nunc et semper et in saecula saeculorum. Amen.\n\nEnglish Translation\n\nPraise be to God\n\nO all you who pass by the way, attend and see: behold the people who walked in darkness have seen a great light; and to those dwelling in the region of the shadow of death, light has arisen.\n\nFor thirty-five years Bohemia was a land of war and blood. Five crusades were sent against her, and all returned in confusion. More than one hundred thousand souls perished in these wars. Churches were devastated, monasteries burned, villages abandoned.\n\nAnd now, not by the sword but by the word, not by crusades but by dialogue, peace has been made. Not all are content, not all accept the articles, but a foundation has been laid upon which building can proceed.\n\nWe ask almighty God to preserve and increase this peace, to take away the heart of stone and give a heart of flesh, to bring to the truth all who still err, and to cause the church of Bohemia, which for so many years was divided and afflicted, to flourish at last in charity and unity.\n\nIf this peace shall endure—and we pray it may endure—the time will come when Bohemian and German, Utraquist and Catholic, shall together approach the table of the Lord and eat of one bread and drink of one cup, and all shall know that we are one in Christ.\n\nGlory be to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit, as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.\n\nFINIS COMPACTATORUM\n\nEND OF THE COMPACTS\n\nHISTORICAL NOTE\n\nThe Compacts of Basel represent one of the most remarkable documents of the fifteenth century: a negotiated peace between the Catholic Church and a heretical movement that had defeated five crusades. It is not a capitulation but a genuine compromise—the Hussites received communion in both kinds (their central demand), while the Church preserved doctrinal integrity through the doctrine of concomitance and maintained ecclesiastical order through approval requirements for preachers.\n\nTimeline:\n\n- 1415: Jan Hus burned at Constance; Bohemian revolt begins\n- 1420: Four Articles of Prague promulgated; First Anti-Hussite Crusade fails\n- 1420-1431: Four more crusades fail catastrophically\n- 1431: Council of Basel invites Hussites to negotiate\n- January-April 1433: Hussite delegation debates at Basel\n- May-November 1433: Council legates negotiate at Prague\n- November 30, 1433: Compacts concluded at Prague\n- May 30, 1434: Battle of Lipany—moderate Hussites defeat Taborites\n- July 5, 1436: Final ratification at Jihlava (Iglau)\n- 1462: Pope Pius II unilaterally annuls the Compacts\n\nKey Figures:\n\n- Cardinal Julian Cesarini — Council president who initiated dialogue\n- John Rokycana — Hussite theologian, elected Archbishop of Prague (never confirmed by Rome)\n- Philibert, Bishop of Coutances — Principal council legate\n- John Palomar — Canon lawyer, chief negotiator for the council\n- Emperor Sigismund — Finally obtained Bohemian crown after 17 years of war\n- Prokop the Great — Taborite leader, killed at Lipany, who rejected the Compacts\n\nSignificance for the Campaign:\n\nIn the alternate timeline (roll 91 - Transformation), the Imperial-Castilian alliance and the Como Declaration's emphasis on genuine reform created a more favorable atmosphere for the negotiations. The Compacts were achieved in November 1433 with broader support and fewer reservations than in the standard timeline.\n\nFor King Juan II, present in Rome when news of the Compacts arrives, this represents proof that the Council of Basel can achieve what crusades could not—reconciliation through dialogue. This precedent strengthens his argument for \"parallel legislation\" and papal-conciliar cooperation.\n\nDocument Length: Approximately 18 pages in standard formatting.\n\nEND OF DOCUMENT",

Emerging from the transformed political landscape following the Declaration of Como (June 1433), wherein Emperor Sigismund and King Juan II of Castile established a framework for papal-conciliar cooperation, this decree demonstrates Basel's capacity for decisive action when factional warfare could be overcome.\n\nBy December 1433, the Council had achieved remarkable unity on the Constantinople question. The preceding months had witnessed the passage of comprehensive reform decrees on electoral procedures (Session XII), clerical concubinage (Session XV), pluralism (Session XVI), and annates (Session XVII), as well as the historic Compacts of Basel ending the Hussite Wars. The crusade decree emerged from this atmosphere of accomplishment, passing with extraordinary conciliar support.\n\nThe decree is notable for several distinctive features:\n\n1. Unprecedented operational specificity: Constantinople is named as the singular objective, Sultan Murad II is identified by name as the adversary, and concrete timelines for force assembly are established.\n\n2. Pragmatic financing mechanisms: Designed to function regardless of ongoing papal-conciliar tensions, routing funds through metropolitan structures and Florentine banks.\n\n3. Careful silence on the Greek schism: The decree neither demands ecclesiastical union as a precondition for aid nor makes any positive statement about Orthodox Christianity.\n\nThe decree incorporates two concrete military commitments: the substantial forces already pledged by King Juan II of Castile (one thousand knights and sixty thousand florins for wall repairs), and the participation of the Knights of St. John from Rhodes. Other Christian princes receive urgent exhortation but made no binding pledges within the decree itself.\n\nOn the question of military command, the decree establishes spiritual authority under a papal legate to be appointed by Pope Eugenius IV, while leaving secular military command undefined beyond calls for \"fraternal coordination.\"\n\nThe decree's aggressive timeline—forces to assemble by summer 1434—was achievable only by those already in motion at the time of promulgation, transforming what was framed as a pan-Christian crusade into an endorsement of King Juan II's personal expedition.\n\nDECREE TEXT\n\n— INVOCATIO —\n\nIn nomine sanctae et individuae Trinitatis, Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti. Amen.\n\nIn the name of the holy and undivided Trinity, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Amen.\n\n— PROEMIUM —\n\nSacrosancta generalis synodus Basiliensis, in Spiritu Sancto legitime congregata, universalem Ecclesiam repraesentans, ad perpetuam rei memoriam.\n\nThe most holy general synod of Basel, legitimately assembled in the Holy Spirit, representing the universal Church, for the perpetual memory of the matter.\n\n— ARENGA —\n\nInter curas multiplices quibus pro universalis Ecclesiae bono sollicitamur, illa praecipue cordi nostro insidet quae ad defensionem fidei Christianae et protectionem fidelium contra infidelium incursus pertinet. Constantinopolis, urbs antiquissima et nobilissima, quae per saecula innumera scutum Christianitatis adversus orientales barbaros stetit, nunc in extremo periculo versatur. Muradus Secundus, Turcorum sultanus, cum ingentibus copiis muros illius gloriosae civitatis quotidie magis premit, et nisi Christiani principes celeriter succurrant, timemus ne cadat illud propugnaculum quod tot saeculis Europam Christianam protexit.\n\nAmong the manifold cares by which we are troubled for the good of the universal Church, that one especially lies close to our heart which pertains to the defense of the Christian faith and the protection of the faithful against the incursions of the infidels. Constantinople, that most ancient and noble city, which through countless ages has stood as the shield of Christendom against the eastern barbarians, now finds itself in extreme peril. Murad the Second, Sultan of the Turks, with immense forces presses daily more heavily upon the walls of that glorious city, and unless Christian princes swiftly bring aid, we fear that bulwark may fall which has protected Christian Europe for so many centuries.\n\n— NARRATIO —\n\nSerenissimus princeps Ioannes Octavus Palaeologus, Romanorum Imperator in Oriente, per legatos suos reverendissimos Metropolitas Bessarionem Nicaenum et Isidorum Kioviensem, ad hoc sacrum Concilium humiliter supplicavit ut Christianitas occidentalis fratres suos orientales in tanto discrimine non deserat. Muri Constantinopolitani, quos magnus Theodosius olim erexit, nunc ruinam minantur; aerarium Imperii exhaustum est; milites pauci sunt qui tam longam circumferentiam defendant. Nisi muri reparentur, nisi milites mittantur, nisi pecunia conferatur, civitas cadet—et cum ea cadet ultimus murus inter Turcas et cor Europae.\n\nThe most serene prince John VIII Palaiologos, Emperor of the Romans in the East, through his most reverend legates the Metropolitans Bessarion of Nicaea and Isidore of Kiev, has humbly petitioned this sacred Council that Western Christendom not abandon its Eastern brothers in such great crisis. The walls of Constantinople, which the great Theodosius once erected, now threaten ruin; the treasury of the Empire is exhausted; few are the soldiers who can defend so long a circumference. Unless the walls are repaired, unless soldiers are sent, unless money is contributed, the city will fall—and with it will fall the last wall between the Turks and the heart of Europe.\n\nHaec sacra synodus, auditis legatis Graecorum, inspectis relationibus de statu murorum et militum, consideratis periculis quae ex casu Constantinopolis toti Christianitati imminebunt, unanimi consensu decernit expeditionem sacram pro defensione illius civitatis.\n\nThis sacred synod, having heard the legates of the Greeks, having examined the reports on the condition of the walls and soldiers, having considered the dangers which will threaten all Christendom from the fall of Constantinople, decrees with unanimous consent a sacred expedition for the defense of that city.\n\nARTICULUS I\nDe Obiecto Expeditionis\nOn the Objective of the Expedition\n\n§1. Haec sacra expeditio unum habet obiectum singulare et definitum: defensionem civitatis Constantinopolitanae contra Turcorum incursus. Non de recuperatione Terrae Sanctae agitur, quamvis illa semper in votis Christianorum maneat; non de expugnatione terrarum infidelium; sed de conservatione et munitione illius urbis quae orientale Christianitatis propugnaculum constituit.\n\nThis sacred expedition has one singular and defined objective: the defense of the city of Constantinople against the incursions of the Turks. It is not about the recovery of the Holy Land, although that always remains in the prayers of Christians; not about the conquest of infidel territories; but about the preservation and fortification of that city which constitutes the eastern bulwark of Christendom.\n\n§2. Obiectivum primarium et immediatum est reparatio murorum Theodosianorum, qui per saecula urbem defenderunt sed nunc in pluribus locis ruinam minantur. Pecunia ad hunc finem destinata in muros, turres, portas, et cetera opera defensiva impendatur, sub inspectione peritorum in arte murali.\n\nThe primary and immediate objective is the repair of the Theodosian walls, which have defended the city through the ages but now threaten ruin in many places. Money destined for this purpose shall be spent on walls, towers, gates, and other defensive works, under the inspection of experts in the art of fortification.\n\n§3. Obiectivum secundarium est praesidium militare civitatis: ut milites Christiani ad defendendam urbem sufficiant donec muri reparati sint et Imperium vires suas restaurare possit. Milites sub disciplina et ordinatione cum Imperatore et ducibus eius coordinati militant.\n\nThe secondary objective is the military garrison of the city: that Christian soldiers suffice for defending the city until the walls are repaired and the Empire can restore its own forces. Soldiers shall serve under discipline and coordination with the Emperor and his commanders.\n\n§4. Adversarius nominatim designatur: Muradus Secundus, Turcorum sultanus, et exercitus eius. Non contra Graecos aut alias nationes Christianas haec expeditio dirigitur, sed solummodo contra infideles qui Christianam urbem expugnare intendunt.\n\nThe adversary is designated by name: Murad the Second, Sultan of the Turks, and his armies. This expedition is not directed against Greeks or other Christian nations, but solely against the infidels who intend to conquer a Christian city.\n\nARTICULUS II\nDe Participantibus in Expeditione\nOn the Participants in the Expedition\n\n§1. Serenissimus princeps Ioannes Secundus, Dei gratia Rex Castellae et Legionis, iam ante promulgationem huius decreti, motu proprio et zelo fidei inflammatus, solemniter promisit mille equites ex Ordinibus Militaribus regni sui—Sancti Iacobi, Calatravae, et Alcantarae—ad defensionem Constantinopolis. Insuper sexaginta milia florenorum pro reparatione murorum destinavit, cum ingeniariis et peritis in arte murali. Haec sacra synodus gratias agit Deo pro tanto exemplo et Regem Castellae tamquam primum inter principes Christianos in hac sancta causa commendat.\n\nThe most serene prince John the Second, by the grace of God King of Castile and León, already before the promulgation of this decree, of his own initiative and inflamed by zeal for the faith, has solemnly promised one thousand knights from the Military Orders of his realm—of Saint James, Calatrava, and Alcántara—for the defense of Constantinople. Moreover he has designated sixty thousand florins for the repair of the walls, along with engineers and experts in the art of fortification. This sacred synod gives thanks to God for such an example and commends the King of Castile as first among Christian princes in this holy cause.\n\n§2. Sacra Religio Hospitalis Sancti Ioannis Hierosolymitani, quae ex insula Rhodi iam contra Turcas continue pugnat, per Magistrum suum promisit participationem plenam in hac expeditione: naves bellicas, milites, et facilitates portus Rhodii pro congregatione et refectione navium aliarum gentium. Fratres Hospitalis, tamquam veterani continuae pugnae contra infideles, pretiosam peritiam afferent.\n\nThe Sacred Religion of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem, which already fights continuously against the Turks from the island of Rhodes, has promised through its Grand Master full participation in this expedition: warships, soldiers, and the facilities of the port of Rhodes for the assembly and provisioning of ships of other nations. The Brothers of the Hospital, as veterans of continuous struggle against the infidels, will bring precious expertise.\n\n§3. Haec sacra synodus omnes et singulos principes Christianos, reges, duces, comites, barones, et dominos temporales, ardentissime exhortatur et in Domino obsecrat ut exemplo Regis Castellae et Fratrum Hospitalis permoti, pro viribus suis ad hanc sanctam expeditionem contribuant. Qui naves habent, naves mittant; qui milites, milites; qui pecuniam, pecuniam. Nemo se excuset propter longinquitatem: Constantinopolis omnium est, et eius casus omnibus nocebit.\n\nThis sacred synod most ardently exhorts and beseeches in the Lord all and singular Christian princes, kings, dukes, counts, barons, and temporal lords, that moved by the example of the King of Castile and the Brothers of the Hospital, they contribute according to their means to this holy expedition. Those who have ships, let them send ships; those who have soldiers, soldiers; those who have money, money. Let no one excuse himself on account of distance: Constantinople belongs to all, and its fall will harm all.\n\n§4. Nominatim invitantur et exhortantur: Serenissimus Imperator Romanorum Sigismundus; Rex Franciae; Rex Angliae; Rex Aragonum et Siciliae; Dux Burgundiae; Respublica Veneta; Respublica Ianuensis; Rex Poloniae; ceteri omnes qui Christi nomen profitentur. Tempus deliberationum transiit; tempus actionis advenit.\n\nSpecifically invited and exhorted are: the Most Serene Emperor of the Romans Sigismund; the King of France; the King of England; the King of Aragon and Sicily; the Duke of Burgundy; the Republic of Venice; the Republic of Genoa; the King of Poland; all others who profess the name of Christ. The time for deliberation has passed; the time for action has arrived.\n\nARTICULUS III\nDe Subsidiis Pecuniariis\nOn Financial Subsidies\n\n§1. Ad sustentationem huius sanctae expeditionis, haec sacra synodus indicit decimam cruciatam triennalem super omnes fructus, redditus, et proventus ecclesiasticos in universa Christianitate. Per tres annos proximos, omnes clerici cuiuscumque gradus vel dignitatis decimam partem reddituum suorum pro defensione Constantinopolis solvant.\n\nFor the support of this holy expedition, this sacred synod imposes a triennial crusade tithe upon all fruits, revenues, and ecclesiastical proceeds throughout all Christendom. For the next three years, all clerics of whatever rank or dignity shall pay a tenth part of their revenues for the defense of Constantinople.\n\n§2. Collectio decimae fiat per metropolitanos in suis provinciis secundum constitutiones canonicas. Metropolitanus deputet collectores idoneos in singulis dioecesibus, qui fideliter colligant et reddant rationem. Eadem structura quae iam exsistit pro aliis contributionibus ecclesiasticis serviat, ut nulla nova administratio necessaria sit.\n\nCollection of the tithe shall be made through metropolitans in their provinces according to canonical constitutions. The metropolitan shall depute suitable collectors in individual dioceses, who shall faithfully collect and render account. The same structure that already exists for other ecclesiastical contributions shall serve, so that no new administration is necessary.\n\n§3. Indulgentia plenaria conceditur omnibus qui personaliter crucem assumpserint et in expeditione serviverint usque ad finem vel usque ad mortem. Indulgentia partialis conceditur contributoribus pecuniariis secundum quantitatem contributionis: qui centum florenos vel plus contribuerit, indulgentiam septem annorum et septem quadragenarum consequatur; qui quinquaginta florenos, quinque annorum; qui viginti florenos, trium annorum; qui minus, proportionaliter.\n\nA plenary indulgence is granted to all who shall personally take the cross and serve in the expedition to the end or until death. A partial indulgence is granted to financial contributors according to the quantity of contribution: whoever contributes one hundred florins or more shall obtain an indulgence of seven years and seven quarantines; whoever fifty florins, five years; whoever twenty florins, three years; whoever less, proportionally.\n\n§4. Indulgentiae praedicantur et administrantur per episcopos locorum vel eorum delegatos. Episcopi publice declarent conditiones indulgentiarum et testimoniales litteras contributoribus tradant. Praedicatores indulgentiarum nihil ultra expensas necessarias pro se retineant.\n\nThe aforesaid indulgences shall be preached and administered by local bishops or their delegates. Bishops shall publicly declare the conditions of the indulgences and deliver testimonial letters to contributors. Preachers of indulgences shall retain nothing for themselves beyond necessary expenses.\n\n§5. Pecuniae collectae deponantur apud domos bancarias Florentinas fidem probatam habentes, non in Camera Apostolica neque in aerario alicuius principis saecularis. Commissio Supervisoria per hoc sacrum Concilium constituta—eadem quae decreta reformationis supervisidet—habeat inspectionem super depositiones et expensas, et rationes trimestrales exigat.\n\nMonies collected shall be deposited with Florentine banking houses of proven reliability, not in the Apostolic Camera nor in the treasury of any secular prince. The Supervisory Commission constituted by this sacred Council—the same that oversees the reform decrees—shall have inspection over deposits and expenditures, and shall require quarterly accounts.\n\n§6. Disbursementa fiant solummodo ad duces militares designatos, post verificationem quod copiae promissae revera congregatae sint. Nulla pecunia solvatur pro copiis quae non exsistunt. Fraudatores pecuniae cruciatae excommunicationi latae sententiae subiacent.\n\nDisbursements shall be made only to designated military commanders, after verification that the promised forces have actually assembled. No money shall be paid for forces that do not exist. Defrauders of crusade money are subject to excommunication latae sententiae.\n\nARTICULUS IV\nDe Praeparatione Spirituali Crucesignatorum\nOn the Spiritual Preparation of Crusaders\n\n§1. Quicumque crucem assumere voluerit, prius confiteatur peccata sua sacerdoti idoneo et veram poenitentiam agat. Expeditio sacra non sit vehiculum quo homines scelerati absolutionem facilem quaerant sine vera conversione cordis. Exemplum sequendum est expeditionis Granatensis, in qua disciplina spiritualis militum fructus mirabiles produxit.\n\nWhoever wishes to take the cross shall first confess his sins to a suitable priest and do true penance. The sacred expedition is not to be a vehicle by which wicked men seek easy absolution without true conversion of heart. The example to be followed is that of the Granada expedition, in which the spiritual discipline of soldiers produced remarkable fruits.\n\n§2. Duces militares curent ut capellani idonei cum copiis proficiscantur, qui sacramenta administrent, verbum Dei praedicent, et disciplinam morum inter milites custodiant. Pro centum militibus, unus saltem capellanus deputetur.\n\nMilitary commanders shall ensure that suitable chaplains travel with the forces, who shall administer the sacraments, preach the word of God, and guard discipline of morals among the soldiers. For every hundred soldiers, at least one chaplain shall be deputed.\n\n§3. Milites crucesignati abstineant a blasphemia, ebrietate, fornicatione, rapina, et omni violentia iniusta. Qui in his peccatis deprehensi fuerint et non correxerint, a crucesignatis expellantur et indulgentiis priventur. Christiani milites Christianos se praestent.\n\nCrusading soldiers shall abstain from blasphemy, drunkenness, fornication, plunder, and all unjust violence. Those who are found in these sins and do not correct themselves shall be expelled from the crusaders and deprived of indulgences. Christian soldiers must show themselves to be Christians.\n\n§4. Speciatim prohibetur omnis violentia contra Christianos Orientales. Memoria Quartae Cruciatae, quae Constantinopolim ipsam depraedavit, opprobrium Christianitatis manet. Qui contra Graecos Christianos violentiam exercuerit, non solum indulgentias amittat sed excommunicationi subiaceat.\n\nEspecially prohibited is all violence against Eastern Christians. The memory of the Fourth Crusade, which plundered Constantinople itself, remains a reproach to Christendom. Whoever exercises violence against Greek Christians shall not only lose indulgences but be subject to excommunication.\n\nARTICULUS V\nDe Regimine Expeditionis\nOn the Governance of the Expedition\n\n§1. Haec sacra synodus Sanctissimum Dominum Nostrum Papam Eugenium Quartum humiliter rogat ut legatum a latere ad hanc expeditionem deputet, virum doctum, prudentem, et zelo fidei ardentem, qui auctoritatem spiritualem in expeditione exerceat.\n\nThis sacred synod humbly asks our Most Holy Lord Pope Eugenius the Fourth to depute a legate a latere for this expedition, a man learned, prudent, and burning with zeal for the faith, who shall exercise spiritual authority in the expedition.\n\n§2. Legatus pontificius habeat auctoritatem in omnibus quae ad spiritualia pertinent: praedicationem cruciatae, administrationem sacramentorum, concessionem indulgentiarum, iudicium causarum ecclesiasticarum inter crucesignatos, et disciplinam moralem exercitus.\n\nThe pontifical legate shall have authority in all things pertaining to spiritual matters: the preaching of the crusade, administration of sacraments, granting of indulgences, judgment of ecclesiastical causes among the crusaders, and moral discipline of the army.\n\n§3. Quoad regimen militare, principes Christiani qui copias contribuerint in spiritu fraternae unitatis coordinentur. Imperator Romanorum Orientis, Ioannes Octavus Palaeologus, in cuius territorio et pro cuius causa pugnatur, tamquam hospes et dominus terrae honoretur. Cum eo et ducibus eius omnia quae ad defensionem civitatis pertinent concordentur.\n\nAs regards military governance, Christian princes who contribute forces shall coordinate in a spirit of fraternal unity. The Emperor of the Romans in the East, John VIII Palaiologos, in whose territory and for whose cause the fighting occurs, shall be honored as host and lord of the land. With him and his commanders, all things pertaining to the defense of the city shall be agreed.\n\n§4. Unusquisque princeps copias suas sub proprio duce teneat, sed omnes duces in consilio communi convenient pro coordinatione operationum. Dissensiones inter duces non per vim sed per deliberationem communem resolvantur, legato pontificio ut arbitro si necessarium.\n\nEach prince shall keep his forces under his own commander, but all commanders shall meet in common council for coordination of operations. Disputes among commanders shall be resolved not by force but by common deliberation, with the pontifical legate as arbiter if necessary.\n\n§5. Si unus princeps longe maiores copias quam ceteri contribuerit, proportionalem vocem in consiliis habeat. Virtus et experientia bellica etiam considerentur in ponderatione consiliorum.\n\nIf one prince shall contribute far greater forces than the others, let him have a proportional voice in councils. Valor and military experience shall also be considered in the weighing of counsels.\n\nARTICULUS VI\nDe Tempore Congregationis\nOn the Time of Assembly\n\n§1. Tempus urget. Muri Constantinopolitani non expectant dum principes deliberant. Quapropter haec sacra synodus decernit ut omnes copiae crucesignatae apud loca congregationis designata conveniant ante Kalendas Augusti anni Domini millesimi quadringentesimi trigesimi quarti—id est, ante mensem Augustum proximi anni.\n\nTime presses. The walls of Constantinople do not wait while princes deliberate. Wherefore this sacred synod decrees that all crusading forces shall assemble at the designated places of congregation before the Kalends of August in the year of Our Lord one thousand four hundred and thirty-four—that is, before the month of August of the coming year.\n\n§2. Loca congregationis designantur: Venetiae, pro illis qui per mare Adriaticum navigabunt; Rhodus, pro illis qui ex meridie venient aut qui per insulam Hospitaliorum transibunt. Ex his locis copiae coordinatae Constantinopolim proficiscantur antequam tempestates autumnales navigationem periculosam reddant.\n\nThe places of congregation are designated: Venice, for those who will sail through the Adriatic Sea; Rhodes, for those who come from the south or who will pass through the island of the Hospitallers. From these places, coordinated forces shall proceed to Constantinople before autumn storms make navigation perilous.\n\n§3. Copiae Castellanae et Hospitaliorum, quae iam in itinere sunt vel brevi erunt, tamquam anteguardia expeditionis procedant. Ceteri principes qui postea copias mittere voluerint, tempestive eas mittant ut cum primis copiis ante hiemem iungantur.\n\nThe forces of Castile and the Hospitallers, which are already on the way or will be shortly, shall proceed as the vanguard of the expedition. Other princes who wish to send forces afterward shall send them in timely fashion so as to join with the first forces before winter.\n\n§4. Principes qui tempus praescriptum servare non possint propter distantiam aut alias causas legitimas, nihilominus copias suas mittant quam primum possibile, et interea pecuniam conferant ut alii in eorum locum militent.\n\nPrinces who cannot keep the prescribed time on account of distance or other legitimate causes shall nevertheless send their forces as soon as possible, and in the meantime shall contribute money so that others may serve in their place.\n\nARTICULUS VII\nDe Coordinatione cum Imperio Orientali\nOn Coordination with the Eastern Empire\n\n§1. Ante adventum copiarum principalium, nuntii ad Imperatorem Ioannem Octavum mittantur qui adventum copiarum annuntient et de necessitatibus logisticis tractent: ubi milites hospitentur, unde alimenta comparentur, quomodo cum ducibus Graecis communicent.\n\nBefore the arrival of the principal forces, messengers shall be sent to Emperor John VIII who shall announce the arrival of forces and treat concerning logistical necessities: where soldiers shall be housed, whence provisions shall be obtained, how they shall communicate with Greek commanders.\n\n§2. Milites occidentales mores et consuetudines Graecorum observent et respectent. In ecclesiis Graecorum sine scandalo se gerant. Graecos tamquam Christianos et fratres, non tamquam haereticos aut inferiores, tractent.\n\nWestern soldiers shall observe and respect the customs and usages of the Greeks. In Greek churches they shall conduct themselves without scandal. They shall treat the Greeks as Christians and brothers, not as heretics or inferiors.\n\n§3. Omnes operationes defensivae cum ducibus militaribus Imperii coordinentur. Constantinus Palaeologus, frater Imperatoris, qui militibus Graecis praeest, tamquam socius aequalis in consiliis bellicis honoretur. Scientia locorum et hostis quam Graeci habent pretiosissima est et plenissime utenda.\n\nAll defensive operations shall be coordinated with the military commanders of the Empire. Constantine Palaiologos, brother of the Emperor, who commands the Greek soldiers, shall be honored as an equal ally in councils of war. The knowledge of terrain and enemy that the Greeks possess is most precious and must be used most fully.\n\n§4. Quaestiones de unione Ecclesiarum, quae per saecula Orientem et Occidentem diviserunt, non sunt obiectum huius expeditionis. Auxilium Christianis in periculo fertur quia Christiani sunt, non sub condicione quod Romani ritus acceptent. Quaestiones theologicae per proprios canales et in propria tempora tractentur.\n\nQuestions concerning the union of the Churches, which have divided East and West through the ages, are not the object of this expedition. Aid is brought to Christians in peril because they are Christians, not under the condition that they accept Roman rites. Theological questions shall be treated through proper channels and at proper times.\n\nARTICULUS VIII\nDe Provisionibus Connexis\nOn Related Provisions\n\n§1. Crucesignati, dum in expeditione sunt, sub protectione speciali Ecclesiae constituuntur. Bona eorum temporalia a quocumque violatore non tangantur. Causae eorum civiles suspendantur donec revertantur vel mors eorum constet. Qui crucesignatos aut familias eorum iniuste vexaverit, excommunicationi subiaceat.\n\nCrusaders, while on the expedition, are constituted under the special protection of the Church. Their temporal goods shall not be touched by any violator. Their civil cases shall be suspended until they return or their death is established. Whoever unjustly harasses crusaders or their families shall be subject to excommunication.\n\n§2. Mercatores qui arma, ferrum, lignum navale, aut alias res bellicas infidelibus vendiderint, excommunicationi latae sententiae subiacent et bonis suis privantur. Hoc commercium proditio Christianitatis est et tamquam tale puniatur.\n\nMerchants who sell arms, iron, ship timber, or other war materials to the infidels are subject to excommunication latae sententiae and shall be deprived of their goods. This commerce is treason against Christendom and shall be punished as such.\n\n§3. Treugae inter principes Christianos, quae iam exsistunt vel quae iniri possint, serventur strictissime dum expeditio durat. Qui treugam fregerit ut bellum inter Christianos moveat dum alii contra infideles pugnant, notam infamiae perpetuam contrahat.\n\nTruces among Christian princes, which already exist or which may be entered into, shall be kept most strictly while the expedition lasts. Whoever breaks a truce to wage war among Christians while others fight against the infidels shall incur a perpetual mark of infamy.\n\n§4. Navigationes commerciales per maria orientalia a piratis et hostibus protegantur. Respublicae maritimae—Veneta, Ianuensis, aliaeque—instanter rogantur ut naves suas pro securitate viarum marinarum disponant.\n\nCommercial shipping through the eastern seas shall be protected from pirates and enemies. The maritime republics—Venice, Genoa, and others—are urgently asked to deploy their ships for the security of sea routes.\n\nARTICULUS IX\nDe Executione et Observantia\nOn Execution and Observance\n\n§1. Hoc decretum vigorem habeat a die promulgationis. Metropolitani illud in synodis provincialibus publicent; episcopi in dioecesibus suis; parochi in ecclesiis. Intra tres menses a promulgatione, omnes fideles de expeditione sacra et de modis participandi edocti sint.\n\nThis decree shall have force from the day of promulgation. Metropolitans shall publish it in provincial synods; bishops in their dioceses; pastors in churches. Within three months of promulgation, all the faithful shall be instructed concerning the sacred expedition and the modes of participating.\n\n§2. Commissio Supervisoria relationem de progressu collectionis decimae et congregationis copiarum ad hoc sacrum Concilium referat trimestribus intervallis. Si impedimenta gravia oriantur, Concilium remedium provideat.\n\nThe Supervisory Commission shall report on the progress of tithe collection and force assembly to this sacred Council at three-month intervals. If serious impediments arise, the Council shall provide remedy.\n\n§3. Legatus pontificius, cum deputatus fuerit, potestatem habeat in loco adaptandi provisiones huius decreti secundum circumstantias inventas, dummodo substantia decreti servetur. Relationes suas ad Sedem Apostolicam et ad hoc sacrum Concilium mittat.\n\nThe pontifical legate, when deputed, shall have power on the spot to adapt the provisions of this decree according to circumstances found, provided the substance of the decree is preserved. He shall send his reports to the Apostolic See and to this sacred Council.\n\n§4. Haec sacra synodus Sanctissimum Dominum Nostrum Papam Eugenium Quartum enixe rogat ut huic decreto auctoritatem Sedis Apostolicae adiungat, ut duplici auctoritate—Concilii et Papae—plenam vim et effectum habeat in universa Christianitate. Unitas Ecclesiae in hac sancta causa manifestetur.\n\nThis sacred synod earnestly asks our Most Holy Lord Pope Eugenius the Fourth to join the authority of the Apostolic See to this decree, so that by the double authority—of Council and Pope—it may have full force and effect throughout all Christendom. Let the unity of the Church be manifested in this holy cause.\n\n— SANCTIO ET CONCLUSIO —\n\nNulli ergo omnino hominum liceat hanc paginam nostrae constitutionis, ordinationis, et decreti infringere vel ei ausu temerario contraire. Si quis autem hoc attentare praesumpserit, indignationem omnipotentis Dei et beatorum Petri et Pauli apostolorum eius se noverit incursurum.\n\nLet no man whatsoever therefore be permitted to infringe this document of our constitution, ordinance, and decree, or to oppose it with reckless boldness. But if anyone shall presume to attempt this, let him know that he will incur the indignation of almighty God and of his blessed apostles Peter and Paul.\n\nDatum Basileae, in publica sessione synodali solemniter in ecclesia cathedrali celebrata, anno Incarnationis Dominicae millesimo quadringentesimo trigesimo tertio, decimonono Kalendas Ianuarii, pontificatus sanctissimi domini nostri Eugenii Papae Quarti anno tertio.\n\nGiven at Basel, in a public synodal session solemnly celebrated in the cathedral church, in the year of the Lord's Incarnation one thousand four hundred and thirty-three, the nineteenth day before the Kalends of January [December 14], in the third year of the pontificate of our most holy lord Pope Eugenius IV.\n\nSUBSCRIPTIONES PATRUM\nSignatures of the Fathers\n\nCardinals:\n\n† Ego Iulianus, miseratione divina tituli Sanctae Sabinae presbyter Cardinalis, Sanctae Romanae Ecclesiae Camerarius et Sacri Concilii Basiliensis Praesidens, subscripsi.\n[I, Giuliano [Cesarini], by divine mercy Cardinal Priest of the title of Santa Sabina, Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church and President of the Sacred Council of Basel, have subscribed.]\n\n† Ego Ludovicus, tituli Sanctae Caeciliae presbyter Cardinalis Arelatensis, subscripsi.\n[I, Louis [Aleman], Cardinal Priest of the title of Santa Cecilia, Archbishop of Arles, have subscribed.]\n\n† Ego Nicolaus, tituli Sanctae Crucis in Hierusalem presbyter Cardinalis, subscripsi.\n[I, Niccolò [Albergati], Cardinal Priest of the title of Santa Croce in Gerusalemme, have subscribed.]\n\nArchbishops:\n\n† Ego Ioannes, Archiepiscopus Tarentinus, subscripsi.\n[I, John, Archbishop of Taranto, have subscribed.]\n\n† Ego Ioannes, Archiepiscopus Lundensis, subscripsi.\n[I, John, Archbishop of Lund, have subscribed.]\n\n† Ego Philibertus, Episcopus Constantiensis, pro natione Gallicana subscripsi.\n[I, Philibert, Bishop of Coutances, for the French nation have subscribed.]\n\nBishops:\n\n† Ego Alfonsus, Episcopus Burgensis, pro Regno Castellae subscripsi.\n[I, Alfonso [de Cartagena], Bishop of Burgos, for the Kingdom of Castile have subscribed.]\n\n† Ego Petrus, Episcopus Pataviensis, pro natione Germanica subscripsi.\n[I, Peter, Bishop of Passau, for the German nation have subscribed.]\n\nAbbots:\n\n† Ego Rodericus, Abbas Sancti Benedicti Vallisoletani, pro Regno Castellae subscripsi.\n[I, Rodrigo [González], Abbot of San Benito of Valladolid, for the Kingdom of Castile have subscribed.]\n\nDoctors and Masters:\n\n† Ego Ioannes de Palomar, decretorum doctor, subscripsi.\n[I, John of Palomar, doctor of decrees, have subscribed.]\n\n† Ego Thomas de Haselbach, sacrae theologiae professor, subscripsi.\n[I, Thomas of Haselbach, professor of sacred theology, have subscribed.]\n\nImperial Legate:\n\n† Ego Caspar Schlick, Sacri Romani Imperii Cancellarius, nomine Serenissimi Imperatoris Sigismundi testis subscripsi.\n[I, Kaspar Schlick, Chancellor of the Holy Roman Empire, have subscribed as witness in the name of the Most Serene Emperor Sigismund.]\n\n— SUBSCRIPTIO NOTARII —\n\nEt ego Henricus Arnoldi, clericus Leodiensis dioecesis, publicus apostolica et imperiali auctoritate notarius, quia praemissis omnibus et singulis, dum sic ut praemittitur fierent et agerentur, una cum praenominatis testibus praesens interfui, eaque omnia et singula sic fieri vidi et audivi, ideo hoc praesens publicum instrumentum manu aliena fideliter scriptum exinde confeci et in hanc publicam formam redegi, signoque et nomine meis solitis et consuetis signavi rogatus et requisitus in fidem et testimonium omnium et singulorum praemissorum.\n\nAnd I, Henry Arnoldi, cleric of the diocese of Liège, public notary by apostolic and imperial authority, because I was present at all and singular the foregoing while they were being done and transacted as set forth above, together with the aforementioned witnesses, and saw and heard all and singular these things done, therefore from this I have drawn up and reduced into this public form the present public instrument faithfully written by another hand, and have signed it with my customary sign and name, being asked and required, in faith and testimony of all and singular the foregoing.\n\nAPPENDIX: Summary of Key Provisions\n\nArticle I — Objective defined as Constantinople defense specifically, with wall repair as primary and military garrison as secondary goals.

      "full_text": "ΤΟΜΟΣ ΤΗΣ ΑΠΟΚΑΤΑΣΤΑΣΕΩΣ\nTOMOS OF THE APOKATASTASIS\n\nA Synodal Declaration Concerning the Sacred Restoration of Orthodox Lands\n\nDrafted at Constantinople, in the Palace of Blachernae\nThe 15th day of April, in the Year of Our Lord 1434\nIn the Reign of His Imperial Majesty John VIII Palaiologos\n\nINVOCATIO\n\nἘν ὀνόματι τοῦ Πατρὸς καὶ τοῦ Υἱοῦ καὶ τοῦ Ἁγίου Πνεύματος. Ἀμήν.\n\nIn the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.\n\nPROOEMIUM: THE THEOLOGICAL FOUNDATION\n\nWe who subscribe our names to this sacred document, being bishops, priests, and clergy of the Holy Orthodox Church, assembled in synod at the God-protected city of Constantinople, do hereby set forth this tomos concerning the restoration of Orthodox Christian lands now held under the dominion of unbelievers.\n\nOn the Anastasis and the Apokatastasis:\n\nOur most holy faith teaches that Christ our God descended into Hades not to wait for the righteous to ascend to Him, but to reach down and raise them up. This is the sacred mystery of the Anastasis—the Resurrection—depicted in our most venerable icons, wherein our Lord grasps the hands of Adam and Eve and draws them forth from darkness into light.\n\nSo also does the Apokatastasis—the Restoration of All Things—reflect the divine economy of salvation. As the Holy Apostle Peter proclaimed: \"Heaven must receive Him until the time of the restoration of all things, which God spoke by the mouth of all His holy prophets since the world began\" (Acts 3:21).\n\nWhile the theological application of apokatastasis to the ultimate fate of souls remains a matter of reverent dispute among the Fathers, its temporal meaning admits no controversy: that which has been stolen from Christ's Church may—and must—be restored. That which was Orthodox shall be Orthodox again. That which was consecrated to the worship of the Trinity shall not remain forever in the hands of those who deny the Son.\n\nOn the Present Calamity:\n\nFor generations beyond counting, the Orthodox faithful have dwelt in the lands of Anatolia, Thrace, Macedonia, and the Peloponnese. Our fathers built churches there. Our mothers baptized children there. The bones of saints and martyrs rest in soil now trodden by those who call Christ a mere prophet and deny His divinity.\n\nThe great sees of the Church—Ephesus, where the Theotokos was proclaimed; Nicaea, where the Creed was written; Chalcedon, where the natures of Christ were defined—these holy places groan under foreign occupation. The bells are silent. The icons are hidden or destroyed. The faithful who remain must pay tribute for the privilege of worshipping the true God.\n\nThis is not the will of Heaven. This is not the eternal order of things. This is a wound in the Body of Christ that cries out for healing.\n\nOn the Distinction from Latin Practice:\n\nWe declare plainly that this sacred undertaking is not a crusade in the Latin manner. We grant no indulgences. We promise no remission of sins in exchange for killing. We do not claim that death in battle guarantees entrance to Paradise, for such presumption belongs to God alone.\n\nThe Latin crusade, whatever its merits or faults, springs from a different theological soil. It is not ours to judge it. But neither is it ours to imitate it.\n\nWhat we proclaim is this: that the defense of Orthodox Christians and the restoration of Orthodox lands is a sacred duty, blessed by God and the Church. Those who contribute to this holy work perform acts of piety equivalent to pilgrimage, almsgiving, or the building of churches. They do not purchase salvation—for salvation cannot be purchased—but they participate in the healing of Christ's wounded Body.\n\nARTICULUS I: ON THE SACRED NATURE OF RESTORATION\n\n§1. We declare and affirm that the defense of Constantinople, the New Rome, the seat of Orthodox Christendom for eleven hundred years, constitutes a sacred obligation upon all the faithful.\n\n§2. We declare and affirm that the liberation of Orthodox lands currently under Ottoman dominion—including but not limited to the territories of Thessalonica, Adrianople, the Morea, and the ancient lands of Anatolia—constitutes a holy work pleasing to God.\n\n§3. We declare and affirm that this apokatastasis seeks not conquest of that which was never ours, but restoration of that which was stolen. We do not march to impose our faith upon others, but to free our brothers and sisters who suffer under the yoke of unbelief.\n\n§4. We declare and affirm that any Orthodox Christian who contributes to this sacred restoration—whether by arms, by treasure, by labor, or by prayer—performs a work of piety that shall be recognized and honored by the Church.\n\nARTICULUS II: ON CONTRIBUTIONS OF TREASURE\n\n§1. The monasteries, churches, and ecclesiastical foundations of the Orthodox world possess treasuries accumulated through the pious donations of the faithful across many generations. These treasures were given for the glory of God and the sustenance of His Church.\n\n§2. We declare that the voluntary contribution of gold, silver, or precious objects to the sacred apokatastasis constitutes a pious work of the highest order. No contribution shall be compelled; all must flow freely from hearts moved by love of God and compassion for suffering brethren.\n\n§3. Monasteries and churches that contribute shall have their gifts recorded in a sacred register, the Codex Apokatastaseos, which shall be preserved in perpetuity as a testament to their faithfulness.\n\n§4. Contributors of treasure shall have their names—whether of institutions or individual donors—inscribed in the diptychs of restored churches, to be commemorated during the Divine Liturgy until Christ returns in glory.\n\n§5. We explicitly forbid the melting of sacred icons, consecrated vessels, or liturgical objects for this purpose. The treasury of piety is not the treasury of worship. Let that which was made for the altar remain upon the altar.\n\nARTICULUS III: ON CONTRIBUTIONS OF SUSTENANCE\n\n§1. The monasteries of the Orthodox world hold granaries, olive presses, and storehouses filled with the fruits of their lands. These provisions were gathered through honest labor and prudent stewardship.\n\n§2. We declare that the voluntary contribution of grain, oil, wine, dried fish, salt, and other provisions to sustain the defenders of Orthodoxy constitutes a pious work equivalent to feeding the hungry—for indeed, those who man the walls hunger, and those who march to liberation require sustenance.\n\n§3. Monasteries that open their granaries shall receive formal acknowledgment in the Codex Apokatastaseos and commemoration in the diptychs as described above.\n\n§4. Where monasteries have suffered hardship and cannot contribute without endangering their own communities, no contribution shall be expected or demanded. Charity that impoverishes the charitable is no charity at all.\n\nARTICULUS IV: ON CONTRIBUTIONS OF SERVICE\n\n§1. Monks and clergy of the Orthodox Church are forbidden by sacred tradition from shedding blood. This prohibition remains absolute and inviolate. No priest shall take up the sword. No monk shall don armor for battle.\n\n§2. Nevertheless, there are forms of service that do not violate these sacred boundaries:\n\n- Healers: Monks trained in medicine may tend the wounded, bind injuries, and comfort the dying without sin.\n- Scribes: Monks skilled in letters may serve as record-keepers, write letters for illiterate soldiers, and maintain the chronicles of the restoration.\n- Chaplains: Priests may accompany armies to celebrate the Divine Liturgy, hear confessions, administer last rites, and pray over the fallen.\n- Counselors: Learned clergy may advise commanders on matters of justice, mercy, and the treatment of prisoners and civilians.\n\n§3. Clergy who serve in these capacities do so with the full blessing of the Church. Their service is not a departure from their vows but a fulfillment of Christ's command to love one another.\n\n§4. Monks and priests who serve shall have their names inscribed in a special section of the Codex Apokatastaseos designated for those who gave not treasure but themselves.\n\nARTICULUS V: ON THE SACRED REMEMBRANCE\n\n§1. The Diptychs of the Orthodox Church are the sacred lists of names—both living and dead—commemorated during the Divine Liturgy. To be inscribed in the diptychs is to be remembered before God, in the holiest moment of Christian worship, until the end of time.\n\n§2. We hereby establish that all who contribute to the sacred apokatastasis—whether by treasure, sustenance, service, or sacrifice—shall have their names inscribed in the diptychs of the churches they helped to restore.\n\n§3. The hierarchy of commemoration shall be as follows:\n\n- Martyrs of the Restoration: Those who give their lives in defense of Orthodox lands or peoples shall be commemorated as martyrs, their names read on the anniversary of their death and on the Feast of All Saints.\n- Benefactors of the Restoration: Those who contribute treasure or sustenance of exceptional magnitude shall be commemorated as ktitores (founders), their names inscribed above the doors of churches they helped to liberate.\n- Servants of the Restoration: All others who contribute shall be commemorated in the general diptychs, their names read during the Liturgy on the anniversary of the liberation of each restored territory.\n\n§4. This commemoration is not an indulgence. We do not promise forgiveness of sins in exchange for contribution. Forgiveness flows from repentance and the mercy of God, not from gold or service.\n\n§5. What we promise is remembrance—that those who gave shall not be forgotten, that their descendants shall hear their names spoken in holy places, that the Church shall honor their sacrifice until the Lord returns.\n\nARTICULUS VI: ON THE GOVERNANCE OF CONTRIBUTIONS\n\n§1. To ensure that contributions reach their sacred purpose and are not diverted by corruption or mismanagement, we establish the following:\n\n§2. A council of oversight, the Synaxis Apokatastaseos, shall be formed consisting of:\n- Two bishops (or their designated representatives)\n- Two laymen of proven integrity, nominated by the Emperor\n- One representative of the contributing monasteries\n\n§3. This council shall maintain the Codex Apokatastaseos, recording all contributions and their disposition. The codex shall be open to inspection by any contributing party.\n\n§4. Annual accounting shall be rendered to a full synod of subscribing bishops, detailing what was received, what was expended, and what remains.\n\n§5. Any member of the Synaxis found to have diverted funds for personal use or purposes other than the sacred restoration shall be excommunicated and their name stricken from all diptychs.\n\nARTICULUS VII: ON THE LIMITS OF THIS DECLARATION\n\n§1. This tomos addresses only the spiritual and ecclesiastical dimensions of the apokatastasis. Matters of military command, political governance of restored territories, and relations with foreign powers remain the province of His Imperial Majesty and his councils.\n\n§2. This tomos does not require, authorize, or endorse any particular military campaign, alliance, or treaty. It establishes only that the principle of restoration is sacred and that contributions to such restoration are pious works.\n\n§3. This tomos does not bind the conscience of any Orthodox Christian to support any particular strategy, commander, or political arrangement. The faithful must judge for themselves, with prayer and discernment, how best to serve the cause of restoration.\n\n§4. This tomos does not supersede the authority of the Ecumenical Patriarch in matters of faith and doctrine. It addresses only the specific question of the apokatastasis and the piety of contributing to it.\n\nCONCLUSIO\n\nWe who subscribe our names do so in full knowledge of the gravity of this declaration. We act not from pride or ambition, but from love of Christ's Church and compassion for our suffering brethren.\n\nWe know that some will oppose this tomos. We know that powerful voices will call it innovation, presumption, or worse. We answer only this: when the walls of Jerusalem fell to Nebuchadnezzar, the prophets did not counsel acceptance of eternal exile. They proclaimed restoration. They promised return. And God honored their faith.\n\nConstantinople is not Jerusalem. We are not prophets. But we serve the same God, and we believe—we must believe—that He has not abandoned His Church to slow extinction.\n\nLet those who have ears hear. Let those who have treasure give. Let those who have strength serve. And let all the faithful pray that God, in His mercy, will grant success to the sacred apokatastasis.\n\nἩ χάρις τοῦ Κυρίου ἡμῶν Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ μετὰ πάντων ὑμῶν. Ἀμήν.\n\nThe grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.\n\nSUBSCRIPTIONES\n\nSpace reserved for the signatures of subscribing bishops, with their sees and the date of subscription\n\nΑἱ ὑπογραφαί:\n\n______________________________________\n[Metropolitan of _____________, in exile]\nSubscribed this ___ day of _______, 14__\n\n______________________________________\n[Metropolitan of _____________, in exile]  \nSubscribed this ___ day of _______, 14__\n\n______________________________________\n[Bishop of _____________]\nSubscribed this ___ day of _______, 14__\n\n______________________________________\n[Bishop of _____________]\nSubscribed this ___ day of _______, 14__\n\n______________________________________\n[Bishop of _____________]\nSubscribed this ___ day of _______, 14__\n\nDrafted by Father Gennadios Scholarios, priest and scholar, at the command of [unnamed], for consideration by the Holy Synod\n\nThis document awaits formal promulgation pending episcopal subscription and, God willing, imperial endorsement\n\n[END OF TOMOS]",

      "full_text": "CHARTA IUDICIORUM LATINORUM CONSTANTINOPOLITANORUM\nCHARTER OF THE LATIN COURTS OF CONSTANTINOPLE\n\nEstablishing Jurisdiction, Procedure, and Enforcement for Disputes Among the Latin Nations and Between Latin and Greek Subjects\n\nDrafted at Constantinople, in the Palace of Blachernae\nThe 15th day of April, in the Year of Our Lord 1434\n\nPREAMBLE\n\nWhereas the City of Constantinople, Queen of Cities, has since ancient times been a meeting place of nations, where merchants of diverse lands conduct commerce under the protection of the Roman Emperor;\n\nAnd whereas disputes arising between persons of different nations have heretofore been resolved through negotiation between quarters, or not resolved at all, leading to violence, bloodshed, and the disruption of trade;\n\nAnd whereas justice delayed is justice denied, and justice partial is no justice at all;\n\nAnd whereas all Christian peoples share a common heritage of law descending from Rome, through both the secular codes of Justinian and the customs of merchants developed in the great trading ports of Christendom;\n\nNow therefore, we who subscribe our names do hereby establish this Charter for the governance of disputes among the Latin nations present in Constantinople, and between Latin and Greek subjects, to the end that justice may be done swiftly, impartially, and in accordance with law.\n\nTITLE I: JURISDICTION\n\nArticle 1: Scope of Authority\n\n§1. The Courts established by this Charter shall have jurisdiction over:\n\n(a) All commercial disputes arising between merchants, traders, factors, or agents of different nations conducting business within the walls of Constantinople or its harbor;\n\n(b) All criminal matters arising between subjects of different nations within the walls of Constantinople or its harbor;\n\n(c) All civil matters—including but not limited to property disputes, inheritance claims, contracts, and torts—arising between subjects of different nations within the walls of Constantinople or its harbor;\n\n(d) Such other matters as the parties may voluntarily submit to the Court's jurisdiction by mutual written agreement.\n\n§2. The Courts shall NOT have jurisdiction over:\n\n(a) Matters purely internal to a single nation's quarter, where all parties are subjects of that nation and the dispute arose entirely within that quarter;\n\n(b) Matters of faith, doctrine, or ecclesiastical discipline, which remain the province of the respective churches;\n\n(c) Matters touching the sovereign authority of the Emperor, which remain the province of the Imperial courts;\n\n(d) Disputes already resolved by final judgment of a competent court, unless new evidence of fraud or perjury emerges.\n\n§3. Where jurisdiction is disputed, the Court shall hear argument from both parties and render a preliminary judgment on its own competence before proceeding to the merits.\n\nArticle 2: Standing\n\n§1. Any person, regardless of nation or station, may bring a matter before the Court, provided:\n\n(a) The person has suffered injury, or represents one who has suffered injury, or acts in official capacity on behalf of a nation or community;\n\n(b) The matter falls within the Court's jurisdiction as defined above;\n\n(c) The person submits to the Court's authority and agrees to abide by its judgment.\n\n§2. In criminal matters, accusation may be brought by:\n\n(a) The injured party, or their heirs or legal representatives;\n\n(b) An official representative of the injured party's nation (podestà, bailo, consul, or equivalent);\n\n(c) Any witness to the crime, acting in the public interest;\n\n(d) An officer of the Court itself, where the crime is notorious and no private accuser comes forward.\n\n§3. The accuser in a criminal matter bears the burden of proof. Should the accusation fail for want of evidence, the accuser shall not face penalty unless the Court finds the accusation was brought maliciously and without reasonable foundation.\n\nArticle 3: Territorial Extent\n\n§1. The Court's authority extends throughout the City of Constantinople, including:\n\n(a) All quarters, whether Latin, Greek, or mixed;\n\n(b) The harbors, docks, and anchorages of the Golden Horn and the Sea of Marmara within sight of the city walls;\n\n(c) Vessels at anchor or moored within said harbors, regardless of the flag they fly.\n\n§2. The Court may hear matters arising outside these boundaries if all parties consent to its jurisdiction and the subject matter has substantial connection to Constantinople.\n\nTITLE II: APPLICABLE LAW\n\nArticle 4: Commercial Matters\n\n§1. In all commercial disputes—including but not limited to contracts, debts, partnerships, bills of exchange, insurance, shipping, and the quality of goods—the Court shall apply the lex mercatoria, the customary law of merchants recognized throughout Christendom.\n\n§2. The fundamental principles of the lex mercatoria include:\n\n(a) **Good Faith (Bona Fides): All parties to commercial dealings are bound to act honestly and without deception. Fraud, misrepresentation, adulteration of goods, use of false weights or measures, and similar deceits are offenses against the entire merchant community.\n\n(b) Sanctity of Contract (Pacta Sunt Servanda): Agreements freely made shall be honored. A promise given binds the promisor. Written contracts take precedence over verbal understandings where the two conflict.\n\n(c) Fair Dealing: Prices must be agreed, not imposed. Quality must be as represented. Goods delivered must match goods promised.\n\n(d) Prompt Resolution: Commercial justice must be swift. The Court shall endeavor to resolve commercial disputes within fourteen days of the matter being brought, except where complexity requires additional time.\n\n§3.** Where the lex mercatoria is silent or unclear, the Court may look to:\n\n(a) The commercial customs of the parties' home nations;\n\n(b) The established practices of the Constantinople trading community;\n\n(c) Reason and equity.\n\nArticle 5: Criminal Matters\n\n§1. In all criminal matters—including but not limited to murder, assault, theft, arson, rape, and other offenses against person or property—the Court shall apply the criminal procedure and substantive law of the Basilika, the Byzantine codification of Roman law.\n\n§2. The fundamental principles of Byzantine criminal procedure include:\n\n(a) The Right to Hear the Accusation: No person shall be tried without being informed of the specific charges against them;\n\n(b) The Right to Respond: The accused shall have opportunity to speak in their own defense and to present evidence and witnesses on their behalf;\n\n(c) The Right to Confront Witnesses: The accused may question those who testify against them, either directly or through an advocate;\n\n(d) The Burden of Proof: The accuser must prove guilt; the accused need not prove innocence;\n\n(e) Standards of Evidence: Guilt in capital cases requires either confession freely given (not extracted under torture) or the testimony of at least two credible witnesses with direct knowledge of the act, or such weight of circumstantial evidence as leaves no reasonable doubt.\n\n§3. The following acts are recognized as capital crimes warranting death:\n\n(a) Murder—the unlawful killing of another person with intent;\n\n(b) Treason—betrayal of the city or its lawful authorities to enemies;\n\n(c) Arson—the deliberate setting of fires that endanger life;\n\n(d) Rape—carnal violation by force;\n\n(e) Kidnapping for ransom or sale into slavery.\n\n§4. Lesser crimes—including theft, assault not resulting in death, fraud, and similar offenses—shall be punished according to the severity of the act and the circumstances, with penalties ranging from fines to imprisonment to banishment to corporal punishment, as the Court determines just.\n\nArticle 6: Civil Matters\n\n§1. In civil matters not of a commercial character—including property disputes, inheritance, marriage contracts, and personal injury—the Court shall apply the principles of Roman civil law as preserved in the Basilika.\n\n§2. Where Roman law conflicts with the established custom of one party's nation on matters of family law or inheritance, the Court shall endeavor to find an equitable resolution that respects both legal traditions.\n\nTITLE III: COMPOSITION OF THE COURT\n\nArticle 7: The Panel of Judges\n\n§1. Each nation maintaining a recognized quarter or commercial presence in Constantinople shall nominate one qualified jurist to serve on the Panel of Judges. Qualifications include:\n\n(a) Knowledge of the lex mercatoria and basic principles of Roman law;\n\n(b) Good reputation and no conviction for dishonesty or violence;\n\n(c) Residence in Constantinople for the duration of service;\n\n(d) No current dispute pending before the Court.\n\n§2. Nominated judges shall be confirmed by agreement of the existing Panel, or in the absence of an existing Panel, by the subscribing parties to this Charter.\n\n§3. Judges shall serve for a term of two years, renewable without limit. A judge may be removed for cause—including corruption, incapacity, or abandonment of duty—by unanimous vote of the remaining judges.\n\nArticle 8: Selection of Judges for Individual Cases\n\n§1. The principle of impartiality requires that no judge shall hear a case involving their own nation as a party.\n\n§2. For disputes between two nations: The judge or judges shall be drawn from a third nation or nations not party to the dispute.\n\n§3. For disputes involving three or more nations: Judges shall be drawn from nations not party to the dispute. If insufficient neutral judges exist, the parties shall agree on a selection, or lots shall be drawn.\n\n§4. For disputes between a Latin party and a Greek party: The judge or judges shall be drawn from Latin nations not involved, unless the Greek party requests and the Latin party agrees to include a Byzantine jurist familiar with the Basilika.\n\n§5. For complex matters or capital cases: The Court may sit as a panel of three judges rather than one, drawn according to the principles above.\n\n§6. Any party may challenge a proposed judge for cause—including personal enmity, financial interest, or prior involvement in the matter. Challenges shall be heard by the remaining judges, whose decision is final.\n\nArticle 9: The Presiding Authority\n\n§1. Until such time as the subscribing nations establish a permanent rotating presidency, the authority to convene the Court, assign judges, and enforce judgments shall rest with the guarantor of this Charter.\n\n§2. The Presiding Authority may hear cases personally, particularly in matters of first impression or exceptional importance, sitting as sole judge or as head of a panel.\n\n§3. The Presiding Authority shall not hear cases in which their own nation is a party, except by unanimous consent of all parties.\n\nTITLE IV: PROCEDURE\n\nArticle 10: Initiating a Case\n\n§1. A matter is brought before the Court by filing a written complaint (libellus) with the Presiding Authority or designated clerk, setting forth:\n\n(a) The names and nations of the parties;\n\n(b) The nature of the dispute or accusation;\n\n(c) The relief or penalty sought;\n\n(d) A summary of the evidence to be presented.\n\n§2. Upon receipt of the complaint, the Court shall:\n\n(a) Determine whether the matter falls within its jurisdiction;\n\n(b) If so, summon the opposing party to respond within three days for commercial matters, seven days for civil matters, and immediately for criminal matters where the accused is in custody;\n\n(c) Assign a judge or panel according to the rules above.\n\nArticle 11: The Response\n\n§1. The responding party shall file a written answer (responsio) admitting or denying the allegations and setting forth any defenses or counterclaims.\n\n§2. Failure to respond within the allotted time may result in default judgment against the non-responding party, unless good cause for delay is shown.\n\nArticle 12: The Hearing\n\n§1. The hearing shall proceed as follows:\n\n(a) The accuser or complainant presents their case first, calling witnesses and presenting documents;\n\n(b) The responding party may question each witness after their testimony;\n\n(c) The responding party then presents their defense, calling witnesses and presenting documents;\n\n(d) The accuser may question each defense witness;\n\n(e) Both parties may make closing arguments summarizing their positions;\n\n(f) The judge or panel retires to deliberate.\n\n§2. All testimony shall be given under oath, with the witness acknowledging that perjury is a sin before God and a crime punishable by the Court.\n\n§3. The judge may question witnesses directly at any point to clarify matters of fact.\n\n§4. The hearing shall be conducted in a language understood by all parties, with interpreters provided as necessary.\n\nArticle 13: Evidence\n\n§1. The following forms of evidence are recognized, in descending order of weight:\n\n(a) Confession: A free and voluntary admission of the facts by a party. Confessions obtained through torture or threat are inadmissible.\n\n(b) Documents: Written contracts, letters, account books, and official records bearing authentic seals or signatures.\n\n(c) Eyewitness Testimony: Statements by persons with direct knowledge of the relevant facts, given under oath.\n\n(d) Expert Testimony: Opinions of persons with specialized knowledge (e.g., physicians on cause of death, merchants on customary trade practices).\n\n(e) Circumstantial Evidence: Facts from which the relevant events may be inferred (e.g., motive, opportunity, possession of stolen goods).\n\n(f) Character Evidence: Testimony regarding a party's reputation for honesty or dishonesty, admitted only where directly relevant.\n\n§2. The judge shall weigh all evidence according to its credibility and relevance, giving more weight to disinterested witnesses than to parties or their close associates.\n\n§3. In capital cases, conviction requires proof beyond reasonable doubt. In civil and commercial cases, the preponderance of credible evidence suffices.\n\nArticle 14: Judgment\n\n§1. The judge or panel shall render judgment within seven days of the close of evidence, except in cases of unusual complexity.\n\n§2. Every judgment shall include:\n\n(a) A statement of the facts as found by the Court;\n\n(b) The legal principles applied;\n\n(c) The reasoning connecting facts to law;\n\n(d) The verdict and, where applicable, the penalty or remedy imposed.\n\n§3. Judgments shall be recorded in writing, with copies provided to all parties and preserved in the Court's archives.\n\nTITLE V: PENALTIES AND REMEDIES\n\nArticle 15: Criminal Penalties\n\n§1. The Court may impose the following penalties for criminal offenses:\n\n(a) Death: By hanging, for capital crimes proven beyond reasonable doubt;\n\n(b) Mutilation: Loss of hand for theft, branding for fraud, as appropriate to the offense and local custom;\n\n(c) Imprisonment: For terms proportionate to the offense;\n\n(d) Banishment: Permanent or temporary expulsion from Constantinople;\n\n(e) Corporal Punishment: Flogging, for lesser offenses;\n\n(f) Fines: Monetary penalties payable to the victim, their heirs, or the public treasury.\n\n§2. Penalties may be combined as justice requires.\n\n§3. Execution of death sentences shall be carried out by officers of the Presiding Authority, in public, within seven days of judgment unless appeal is pending.\n\nArticle 16: Civil and Commercial Remedies\n\n§1. The Court may order the following remedies in civil and commercial cases:\n\n(a) Monetary Damages: Compensation for losses suffered;\n\n(b) Specific Performance: Ordering a party to fulfill their contractual obligations;\n\n(c) Rescission: Declaring a contract void and ordering return of consideration;\n\n(d) Injunction: Ordering a party to cease harmful conduct;\n\n(e) Restitution: Ordering return of property wrongfully taken or held.\n\n§2. Interest may be awarded on monetary judgments at a rate not exceeding eight percent per annum.\n\nTITLE VI: APPEAL\n\nArticle 17: Right of Appeal\n\n§1. Any party aggrieved by a judgment may appeal within fourteen days of the judgment being rendered.\n\n§2. Appeals must be in writing and must specify:\n\n(a) The grounds for appeal (error of law, error of fact, new evidence, or procedural irregularity);\n\n(b) The relief sought.\n\n§3. Appeals shall be heard by a panel of three judges, none of whom sat on the original case and none of whom are of the same nation as the appellant.\n\nArticle 18: Scope of Review\n\n§1. On appeal, the panel may:\n\n(a) Affirm the judgment below;\n\n(b) Reverse the judgment in whole or in part;\n\n(c) Modify the penalty or remedy;\n\n(d) Remand for new trial where procedural errors tainted the original proceeding.\n\n§2. New evidence may be considered on appeal only if it was not available at the original trial despite reasonable diligence.\n\n§3. Execution of judgment is stayed pending appeal, except that accused persons may remain in custody if flight risk exists.\n\nArticle 19: Finality\n\n§1. The decision of the appellate panel is final. No further appeal lies except to the Presiding Authority on grounds of manifest injustice or corruption, and such extraordinary review is discretionary.\n\nTITLE VII: ENFORCEMENT\n\nArticle 20: Compliance\n\n§1. All parties who submit to the Court's jurisdiction are bound to comply with its judgments.\n\n§2. Subscribing nations pledge to enforce judgments against their own subjects, including:\n\n(a) Collection of fines and damages;\n\n(b) Surrender of persons for imprisonment or execution;\n\n(c) Recognition and enforcement of the Court's orders within their quarters.\n\nArticle 21: Non-Compliance\n\n§1. If a party fails to comply with a judgment:\n\n(a) The Court shall issue a writ of non-compliance, publicly recorded;\n\n(b) The non-compliant party shall be barred from bringing any matter before the Court until compliance is achieved;\n\n(c) The Court may authorize seizure of the non-compliant party's goods or property within its jurisdiction;\n\n(d) The Presiding Authority may direct armed force to effect compliance.\n\n§2. If a nation or quarter shelters a person subject to the Court's judgment, refusing surrender or extradition:\n\n(a) The Court shall issue formal demand to the authorities of that nation or quarter;\n\n(b) If the demand is not satisfied within fourteen days, the sheltering nation or quarter shall be deemed in contempt;\n\n(c) Contempt may be punished by exclusion of that nation's subjects from the Court's protection, suspension of commercial privileges, or such other sanctions as the Presiding Authority deems appropriate;\n\n(d) Persistent contempt may be reported to the sovereign authorities of the offending nation for action.\n\nArticle 22: Extradition\n\n§1. When a person subject to the Court's jurisdiction flees to territory outside Constantinople, the Court may issue a request for extradition to the relevant sovereign authority.\n\n§2. Subscribing nations pledge to honor such requests in good faith, subject to their own laws regarding extradition.\n\n§3. Pending extradition, judgment is not void but held in abeyance, and the fugitive status is recorded in the Court's archives and published to all subscribing nations.\n\nTITLE VIII: ADMINISTRATION\n\nArticle 23: Records\n\n§1. The Court shall maintain archives including:\n\n(a) All complaints and responses filed;\n\n(b) Records of proceedings, including witness lists and summaries of testimony;\n\n(c) All judgments rendered, with full reasoning;\n\n(d) Records of compliance and non-compliance.\n\n§2. These archives shall be open to inspection by parties to concluded cases and by officials of subscribing nations.\n\nArticle 24: Funding\n\n§1. The Court shall be funded by:\n\n(a) Filing fees paid by parties initiating cases;\n\n(b) Fines collected;\n\n(c) Contributions from subscribing nations in proportion to their commercial presence.\n\n§2. Judges shall receive reasonable compensation for their service, funded from the Court's treasury.\n\nArticle 25: Amendments\n\n§1. This Charter may be amended by agreement of all subscribing nations.\n\n§2. Proposed amendments shall be circulated to all subscribers with at least thirty days for consideration before adoption.\n\nTITLE IX: RATIFICATION AND EFFECT\n\nArticle 26: Subscription\n\n§1. This Charter takes effect upon subscription by at least two nations maintaining commercial presence in Constantinople, plus the endorsement of the Presiding Authority.\n\n§2. Additional nations may subscribe at any time by filing written acceptance with the Court's archives.\n\n§3. Subscription by the Imperial authority of Constantinople, when obtained, shall extend the Court's jurisdiction to matters between Latin and Greek subjects as described herein.\n\nArticle 27: Withdrawal\n\n§1. Any subscribing nation may withdraw from this Charter upon sixty days' written notice.\n\n§2. Withdrawal does not affect judgments already rendered or proceedings already commenced.\n\n§3. A withdrawn nation's subjects may still bring matters before the Court but may not serve as judges.\n\nCONCLUSIO\n\nThis Charter is established in the hope that justice, administered fairly and without favor, may bring peace where there has been strife, and order where there has been chaos. Let all who subscribe commit themselves to its principles, and let all who come before it receive judgment according to law.\n\nDrafted at Constantinople this fifteenth day of April, in the Year of Our Lord 1434, in the presence of the undersigned.\n\nSUBSCRIPTIONES\n\nFor the Most Serene Republic of Venice:\n\n______________________________________\nMarco Contarini, Bailo\nSubscribed this ___ day of _______, 1434\n\nFor the Most Serene Republic of Genoa:\n\n______________________________________\nRaffaele Lomellini, Podestà\nSubscribed this ___ day of _______, 1434\n\nFor the Kingdom of Castile, as Guarantor and Presiding Authority:\n\n______________________________________\n[To be signed]\nSubscribed this ___ day of _______, 1434\n\nFor the Roman Empire of Constantinople:\n\n______________________________________\n[Reserved for Imperial subscription]\nSubscribed this ___ day of _______, 14__\n\nAdditional nations may subscribe below as they establish presence:\n\nFor _______________:\n\n______________________________________\n[Name and Title]\nSubscribed this ___ day of _______, 14__\n\n[END OF CHARTER]",

There is hereby established the office of Defensor Romaniae—Defender of Romania—to be held by His Most Christian Majesty Juan II, King of Castile, León, Toledo, Galicia, Seville, Córdoba, Murcia, Jaén, the Algarve, Algeciras, and Gibraltar, Lord of Vizcaya and Molina, Conqueror of Granada.\n\n§2. This office is created in recognition that God, in His providence, has sent a champion to defend His people when their own strength has failed. It carries no claim to the Imperial throne, no authority over matters of Orthodox faith and doctrine, and no diminution of the Emperor's sacred dignity as isapostolos and rightful sovereign of the Roman realm.\n\n§3. The Defensor Romaniae serves as guardian and protector of the Roman people until such time as the Empire can stand secure upon its own foundations, at which time this office shall be dissolved or transformed according to the wisdom of Emperor and Defender together.\n\nArticle 2: Military Authority\n\n§1. The Defensor Romaniae holds supreme command over all military forces operating in defense of Constantinople and for the restoration of Roman lands, including:\n\n(a) All armies raised under this Charter, whether professional, thematic, or militia;\n\n(b) All naval forces, whether imperial, allied, or contributed by subscribing nations;\n\n(c) All foreign auxiliaries, mercenaries, and allied contingents serving the cause of restoration;\n\n(d) All garrison forces in Constantinople and in territories reconquered under this Charter.\n\n§2. The Defensor Romaniae may:\n\n(a) Summon all persons owing military obligation to service;\n\n(b) Appoint and dismiss military officers at all ranks;\n\n(c) Determine strategy, direct campaigns, and order the movement of forces;\n\n(d) Establish military regulations, discipline, and standards of training;\n\n(e) Requisition supplies, transport, and materials necessary for military operations;\n\n(f) Negotiate with enemies concerning truces, prisoner exchanges, and terms of surrender;\n\n(g) Distribute conquered territories according to the systems established in this Charter.\n\n§3. The Emperor retains:\n\n(a) The sacred authority to bless armies and consecrate banners;\n\n(b) The right to be consulted on matters of grand strategy;\n\n(c) The dignity of ultimate sovereignty, in whose name victories are proclaimed;\n\n(d) The authority to dissolve this Charter by mutual agreement with the Defensor.\n\nArticle 3: Civil Authority\n\n§1. In matters touching military necessity, the Defensor Romaniae may:\n\n(a) Requisition materials and labor for fortification construction and repair;\n\n(b) Impose curfews and movement restrictions during military emergencies;\n\n(c) Commandeer vessels, wagons, and animals for military transport;\n\n(d) Establish military courts for offenses committed by persons under arms.\n\n§2. Civil governance in Constantinople remains under Imperial authority. The Defensor Romaniae does not:\n\n(a) Collect taxes, except those specifically designated for military purposes under this Charter;\n\n(b) Administer justice in non-military matters, except as provided in the Charter of the Latin Courts;\n\n(c) Appoint civil officials or interfere in civil administration;\n\n(d) Legislate on matters unrelated to defense and military organization.\n\n§3. In reconquered territories, civil and military authority shall be exercised jointly until permanent administration is established, with the Defensor holding precedence in matters affecting security.\n\nTITLE II: THE URBAN MILITIA\n\nArticle 4: Universal Obligation\n\n§1. Every able-bodied male resident of Constantinople between the ages of sixteen and fifty-five owes service in the Urban Militia, without exception of rank, wealth, or nation.\n\n§2. \"Able-bodied\" means capable of bearing arms and performing military duty. Exemptions for physical incapacity shall be certified by examination and recorded in the militia rolls.\n\n§3. The only exemptions from militia service are:\n\n(a) Clergy in holy orders, who serve as chaplains and healers rather than combatants;\n\n(b) Physicians and surgeons, who serve in medical capacity;\n\n(c) Those already serving in professional military forces or thematic obligations.\n\n§4. No exemption may be purchased. No substitutes may be hired. The obligation is personal and non-transferable.\n\nArticle 5: Organization by Guild and Quarter\n\n§1. The Urban Militia shall be organized according to the traditional guild and quarter structure of Constantinople:\n\n(a) Each recognized guild shall maintain a militia company (tagma) comprising all members and journeymen of military age;\n\n(b) Each quarter shall maintain militia units comprising residents not enrolled in guild companies;\n\n(c) The Latin quarters shall maintain separate units under their own officers, coordinated with the Greek militia structure.\n\n§2. Guild Masters and Quarter Captains are responsible for:\n\n(a) Maintaining accurate rolls of all persons owing militia service;\n\n(b) Ensuring attendance at prescribed training sessions;\n\n(c) Reporting absences and exemption claims to militia authorities;\n\n(d) Storing and maintaining guild or quarter armaments.\n\n§3. Failure to maintain accurate rolls or enforce attendance shall result in fines against the responsible guild or quarter, collectible from guild treasuries or quarter assessments.\n\nArticle 6: Training Requirements\n\n§1. All militia members shall attend mandatory training as follows:\n\n(a) Basic Training: Upon enrollment, forty consecutive days of intensive drill in weapons handling, formation fighting, and wall defense;\n\n(b) Ongoing Training: One full day every seven days (the Day of Mars), devoted to drill and exercises;\n\n(c) Seasonal Exercises: Four times yearly, three consecutive days of large-scale maneuvers combining multiple units.\n\n§2. Training shall be conducted by professional officers appointed by the Defensor Romaniae, assisted by veterans and experienced militia leaders.\n\n§3. Training shall include:\n\n(a) Individual weapons proficiency—spear, sword, bow, crossbow as appropriate to assignment;\n\n(b) Formation drill—shield walls, pike squares, organized advance and retreat;\n\n(c) Wall defense—manning positions, responding to signals, coordinating with adjacent units;\n\n(d) Basic fortification—digging, construction, repair of defensive works;\n\n(e) Fire response—controlling blazes, preventing spread during siege conditions.\n\n§4. Absence from training without valid cause (illness, family emergency, essential civic duty) shall be punished by:\n\n(a) First offense: Fine of one day's wages;\n\n(b) Second offense: Fine of one week's wages;\n\n(c) Third offense: Public labor on fortifications for fourteen days;\n\n(d) Persistent absence: Imprisonment and forfeiture of property.\n\nArticle 7: Equipment\n\n§1. The Defensor Romaniae shall provide initial equipment to all militia members from the Imperial arsenals and from contributions under the Apokatastasis, including:\n\n(a) Primary weapon appropriate to assignment (spear, pike, sword, bow, or crossbow);\n\n(b) Secondary weapon (short sword or dagger);\n\n(c) Helmet of leather or iron;\n\n(d) Shield appropriate to assignment;\n\n(e) Padded jacket or gambeson.\n\n§2. Equipment issued remains the property of the militia stores. Members are responsible for maintenance and must return equipment upon death, disability, or departure from the city.\n\n§3. Members who acquire personal equipment of superior quality may use it in place of issued equipment, subject to inspection for adequacy.\n\n§4. Guilds with traditional association to particular crafts shall contribute to equipment production:\n\n(a) Smiths' guilds: Weapons and armor repair, production of arrowheads and spear points;\n\n(b) Leather workers: Armor padding, scabbards, belts, and straps;\n\n(c) Carpenters: Spear shafts, shield construction, siege equipment;\n\n(d) Rope makers: Bowstrings, siege cordage, naval supplies.\n\nSuch contributions shall be compensated at fair rates from military funds.\n\nArticle 8: Wall Assignments\n\n§1. Every militia unit shall be assigned a specific section of the Theodosian Walls or sea walls for defense. Assignments shall be recorded and posted publicly.\n\n§2. Upon the sounding of the alarm—bells, trumpets, or beacon fires—every militia member shall proceed immediately to their assigned position, equipped and ready for combat.\n\n§3. Response time from alarm to full manning of walls shall not exceed two hours. Units shall drill this response regularly.\n\n§4. Wall assignments shall be reviewed quarterly and adjusted as population shifts or military necessity requires.\n\nArticle 9: Militia in Offensive Operations\n\n§1. The Urban Militia is primarily a defensive force. However, militia units may be called to serve in offensive operations beyond the walls under the following conditions:\n\n(a) The immediate threat to Constantinople has been relieved;\n\n(b) Sufficient forces remain to garrison the walls;\n\n(c) The campaign is of limited duration (not exceeding ninety days);\n\n(d) Service is voluntary for campaigns beyond Thrace.\n\n§2. Militia members who volunteer for offensive campaigns shall receive:\n\n(a) Wages equivalent to professional soldiers for the duration of service;\n\n(b) A share of any plunder according to established military custom;\n\n(c) Priority consideration for land grants in conquered territories.\n\n§3. Distinguished service in offensive operations may qualify militia members for elevation to professional forces or thematic cavalry obligations.\n\nTITLE III: THE PRONOIA OBLIGATIONS\n\nArticle 10: Reinstatement of Pronoia Service\n\n§1. All holders of pronoia grants—revenues from lands, villages, harbors, tolls, or other sources granted by imperial authority—owe military service proportional to their grant's value.\n\n§2. This obligation, long neglected, is hereby reinstated and shall be strictly enforced. No pronoia holder may collect revenues without fulfilling military duties.\n\n§3. The scale of obligation shall be:\n\n(a) Minor pronoia (annual revenue below 100 hyperpyra): One equipped infantryman, or personal service as infantry;\n\n(b) Medium pronoia (annual revenue 100-500 hyperpyra): One equipped cavalryman with horse and armor, or personal service as cavalry;\n\n(c) Major pronoia (annual revenue 500-2000 hyperpyra): Three equipped cavalrymen, or personal service plus two additional mounted men;\n\n(d) Great pronoia (annual revenue above 2000 hyperpyra): One cavalryman per 500 hyperpyra of revenue, with personal service required of the holder unless aged or infirm.\n\n§4. \"Equipped\" means armed and armored to standards prescribed by military regulations, mounted on horses fit for campaign service, with supplies sufficient for thirty days in the field.\n\nArticle 11: Registration and Inspection\n\n§1. Within sixty days of this Charter's ratification, all pronoia holders shall register their grants with the military authority, declaring:\n\n(a) The source and nature of the grant;\n\n(b) The assessed annual revenue;\n\n(c) The military obligation thereby incurred;\n\n(d) The names and equipment of men provided, or declaration of personal service.\n\n§2. Annual inspections shall verify that:\n\n(a) Declared revenues are accurate;\n\n(b) Required men are available and equipped;\n\n(c) Horses are fit for service;\n\n(d) Equipment meets prescribed standards.\n\n§3. False declaration of revenues shall be punished by:\n\n(a) Fine equal to twice the undeclared amount;\n\n(b) Forfeiture of the pronoia for persistent fraud.\n\n§4. Failure to provide required men or equipment shall be punished by:\n\n(a) Fine sufficient to hire equivalent forces for one year;\n\n(b) Forfeiture of the pronoia for persistent failure.\n\nArticle 12: Household Guards\n\n§1. Great nobles maintaining private household guards (oikeioi) shall convert these forces to public service under the following terms:\n\n(a) All household guards shall be registered with military authority;\n\n(b) When summoned, household guards serve under the Defensor's command, not their lord's private direction;\n\n(c) Household guards count toward the lord's pronoia obligation if properly equipped and trained;\n\n(d) Maintenance of guards beyond pronoia obligation is permitted but such excess forces remain subject to summons.\n\n§2. No noble may maintain armed household forces exceeding twice their pronoia obligation without specific authorization from the Defensor Romaniae.\n\n§3. Unauthorized private armies shall be disbanded. Resistance to disbandment constitutes rebellion against lawful military authority.\n\nArticle 13: Noble Personal Service\n\n§1. Holders of great pronoia—those with revenues exceeding 2000 hyperpyra annually—owe personal service in campaign unless exempted for age (over sixty) or certified physical incapacity.\n\n§2. Personal service means actual presence in the field, under arms, sharing the dangers and hardships of campaign. Service cannot be fulfilled by remaining in Constantinople while retainers march.\n\n§3. Nobles who evade personal service through feigned illness, invented emergencies, or simple absence shall:\n\n(a) First offense: Forfeit one year's pronoia revenue to military funds;\n\n(b) Second offense: Forfeit the pronoia entirely;\n\n(c) Third offense: Face charges of cowardice before military tribunal.\n\n§4. The principle is absolute: everyone fights. Rank provides no shelter from obligation. Wealth purchases no exemption. The farmer on the walls and the lord in the cavalry owe the same duty to the Empire's defense.\n\nTITLE IV: THE THEMATIC SYSTEM\n\nArticle 14: Establishment in Reconquered Territories\n\n§1. As territories are liberated from Ottoman occupation, military land grants shall be established according to the ancient thematic model, adapted to present circumstances.\n\n§2. The purposes of the thematic system are:\n\n(a) To populate reconquered lands with settlers capable of defending them;\n\n(b) To create a self-sustaining military force that does not depend on treasury payments;\n\n(c) To bind families to military service across generations;\n\n(d) To reward those who fight for the restoration with permanent stake in its success.\n\n§3. Land for thematic grants shall come from:\n\n(a) Former Ottoman timar holdings, reverting to Roman sovereignty upon liberation;\n\n(b) Abandoned lands whose former owners cannot be identified;\n\n(c) Lands confiscated from those who actively collaborated with Ottoman rule;\n\n(d) Imperial domain lands designated for military settlement.\n\nArticle 15: Categories of Grants\n\n§1. Thematic grants shall be made in three categories:\n\n**Infantry Holdings (Stratiotika Ktemata):**\n\n(a) Sufficient land to support one family and equip one infantryman;\n\n(b) Approximately 30-50 modioi of arable land, depending on soil quality;\n\n(c) Obligation: One equipped infantryman when summoned, attending monthly training;\n\n(d) Granted to: Common soldiers, militiamen who volunteer for settlement, Greek farmers already working the land who accept military obligation.\n\n**Cavalry Holdings (Kaballika Ktemata):**\n\n(a) Sufficient land to support one family, maintain one war horse, and equip one cavalryman;\n\n(b) Approximately 100-150 modioi of arable land, with pasture for horses;\n\n(c) Obligation: One equipped cavalryman with horse when summoned, attending monthly training;\n\n(d) Granted to: Distinguished soldiers, junior officers, existing small landholders who can demonstrate horsemanship.\n\n**Officer Holdings (Archontika Ktemata):**\n\n(a) Larger estates supporting multiple military obligations;\n\n(b) 300+ modioi with associated rights and revenues;\n\n(c) Obligation: Personal service as officer, plus provision of additional men according to holding size;\n\n(d) Granted to: Proven commanders, nobles who demonstrate exceptional service, those entrusted with regional military responsibility.\n\nArticle 16: Terms and Conditions\n\n§1. Thematic grants are hereditary but conditional:\n\n(a) The grant passes to heirs so long as military obligation is fulfilled;\n\n(b) Grants may not be sold, donated, or alienated without authorization;\n\n(c) Grants may not be divided below minimum size for their category;\n\n(d) If the line fails or obligation goes unfulfilled for three consecutive summons, the grant reverts to military authority for redistribution.\n\n§2. Holders of thematic grants must:\n\n(a) Reside on or near the granted land;\n\n(b) Maintain prescribed weapons and equipment (provided initially, self-maintained thereafter);\n\n(c) Attend monthly training sessions conducted by regional officers;\n\n(d) Answer summons within prescribed time (generally seven days for local defense, fourteen days for distant campaign);\n\n(e) Serve for the duration of the campaign or until properly discharged.\n\n§3. Holders of thematic grants may not:\n\n(a) Abandon the land for more than one year without authorization;\n\n(b) Convert agricultural land to other uses that reduce its capacity to support military obligation;\n\n(c) Accumulate multiple grants beyond their capacity to fulfill combined obligations;\n\n(d) Transfer obligation to substitutes or hired men (personal service required).\n\nArticle 17: Initial Equipment and Training\n\n§1. Recognizing that populations under Ottoman rule have been forbidden weapons for generations, the Defensor Romaniae shall provide:\n\n(a) Initial weapons and equipment to all new thematic grant holders;\n\n(b) Intensive training for the first year following grant—not less than ninety days of professional instruction;\n\n(c) Ongoing training supervision by professional officers assigned to each thematic district;\n\n(d) Gradual transition to self-equipment over a period of ten years.\n\n§2. The cost of initial equipment and training shall be borne by:\n\n(a) Contributions under the Apokatastasis framework;\n\n(b) Revenues from reconquered territories;\n\n(c) The military treasury of the Defensor Romaniae;\n\n(d) Plunder and tribute captured from the enemy.\n\n§3. After the initial ten-year period, thematic holders are responsible for maintaining their own equipment. Failure to maintain adequate equipment shall be punished as failure to fulfill military obligation.\n\nArticle 18: Rights and Protections\n\n§1. Thematic grant holders enjoy the following rights:\n\n(a) Security of tenure so long as obligations are fulfilled;\n\n(b) Exemption from ordinary taxation on the granted land (military service substitutes for tax);\n\n(c) The right to pass the grant to heirs;\n\n(d) Access to military justice for disputes arising from service;\n\n(e) Compensation for wounds suffered in service, support for families of those killed.\n\n§2. Widows of fallen soldiers retain the grant for their lifetime or until remarriage, provided a son or other male heir can fulfill military obligation upon reaching age sixteen.\n\n§3. Orphans of fallen soldiers retain the grant under guardianship until reaching military age. Guardians must ensure the orphan receives military training.\n\n§4. Soldiers permanently disabled in service retain their grants without military obligation, in recognition of sacrifice already given.\n\nArticle 19: Distribution Principles\n\n§1. In distributing thematic grants, priority shall be given to:\n\n(a) Soldiers who served in the campaign that liberated the territory;\n\n(b) Greek farmers already working the land who accept military obligation and demonstrate loyalty;\n\n(c) Volunteers from Constantinople and other Roman territories willing to resettle;\n\n(d) Veterans of allied forces who wish to remain and serve the Empire.\n\n§2. Distribution shall aim for mixed settlement where practical—newcomers alongside existing populations—to prevent isolation and promote integration.\n\n§3. Greeks who converted to Islam under Ottoman rule may receive grants if they:\n\n(a) Return to Orthodox Christianity (or accept baptism if previously unconverted);\n\n(b) Demonstrate loyalty to the restored Roman authority;\n\n(c) Fulfill all military obligations without exception.\n\nThose unwilling to fulfill these conditions may remain as taxpaying subjects but shall not receive military land grants.\n\n§4. No grants shall be made to:\n\n(a) Active collaborators with Ottoman authority against Roman populations;\n\n(b) Those who voluntarily served in Ottoman military forces;\n\n(c) Those who informed against Christians to Ottoman authorities.\n\nSuch persons shall face justice according to the severity of their collaboration.\n\nTITLE V: THE PROFESSIONAL FORCES\n\nArticle 20: The Tagmata\n\n§1. At the core of the military structure shall stand the professional tagmata—standing regiments serving year-round for wages, forming the elite force for offensive operations and the backbone of defense.\n\n§2. The tagmata shall comprise:\n\n(a) **Heavy Cavalry (Kataphraktoi): Fully armored horsemen capable of shock combat;\n\n(b) Light Cavalry (Trapezitai): Mobile forces for scouting, screening, and pursuit;\n\n(c) Heavy Infantry (Skutatoi): Armored infantry forming the battle line;\n\n(d) Archers and Crossbowmen (Toxotai): Ranged troops for both field and siege;\n\n(e) Engineers (Mekhanikoi): Specialists in siege craft, fortification, and military construction;\n\n(f) Marines (Nautatoi Stratiotes): Troops trained for naval combat and amphibious operations.\n\n§3. Professional soldiers shall be recruited from:\n\n(a) Distinguished militia members demonstrating exceptional skill;\n\n(b) Thematic soldiers seeking professional careers;\n\n(c) Foreign volunteers with proven military experience;\n\n(d) Young men of any background who pass selection and complete training.\n\nArticle 21: Terms of Service\n\n§1. Professional soldiers serve under the following terms:\n\n(a) Initial enlistment for five years;\n\n(b) Re-enlistment available indefinitely for those maintaining standards;\n\n(c) Regular wages paid monthly, at rates competitive with mercenary service elsewhere;\n\n(d) Provisions, equipment, and quarters provided;\n\n(e) Share in plunder according to rank and contribution;\n\n(f) Retirement benefits after twenty years: land grant or pension.\n\n§2. Professional soldiers are subject to military law at all times, not merely when on campaign. Discipline is strict:\n\n(a) Desertion: Death;\n\n(b) Cowardice in battle: Death or degradation to labor units;\n\n(c) Theft from comrades: Flogging and expulsion;\n\n(d) Disobedience: Punishment according to severity, from extra duty to execution.\n\n§3. Professional soldiers may not:\n\n(a) Marry without permission of commanding officer;\n\n(b) Engage in trade or commerce while in service;\n\n(c) Hold other employment or obligation conflicting with military duty;\n\n(d) Leave garrison or camp without authorization.\n\nArticle 22: The Officer Corps\n\n§1. Command of all military forces—militia, pronoia, thematic, and professional—shall be exercised through a unified officer corps appointed by and answering to the Defensor Romaniae.\n\n§2. Officers shall be selected based on:\n\n(a) Demonstrated military competence;\n\n(b) Leadership ability;\n\n(c) Loyalty to the cause of restoration;\n\n(d) Education in military science and history where available.\n\n§3. Birth and wealth shall not be prerequisites for officer rank. A common soldier who demonstrates ability may rise to the highest commands. A noble who demonstrates incompetence shall not command.\n\n§4. Officer ranks shall be:\n\n(a) Dekarchos (Sergeant): Commands ten men;\n\n(b) Kentarchos (Captain): Commands one hundred men;\n\n(c) Taxiarchos (Major): Commands a battalion of 500-1000;\n\n(d) Droungarios (Colonel): Commands a regiment of 2000-3000;\n\n(e) Strategos (General): Commands a division or army corps;\n\n(f) Megas Domestikos (Supreme Commander): Reserved for the Defensor Romaniae or his designated deputy.\n\n§5. Officers are responsible for:\n\n(a) Training the forces under their command;\n\n(b) Maintaining discipline and equipment standards;\n\n(c) Executing orders from superior authority;\n\n(d) The welfare of their soldiers;\n\n(e) Honest reporting of unit strength and capability.\n\n§6. Officers who falsify reports, neglect training, abuse soldiers, or fail in their duties shall be removed and punished according to the severity of failure.\n\nTITLE VI: THE NAVY\n\nArticle 23: Naval Forces\n\n§1. The defense and restoration of the Empire require naval power. The Defensor Romaniae holds command over all naval forces as over land forces.\n\n§2. Naval forces shall comprise:\n\n(a) War Galleys (Dromones): For combat operations in coastal and restricted waters;\n\n(b) Transport Ships (Ousiaka): For movement of troops and supplies;\n\n(c) Fire Ships (Pyrophoroi): Equipped with Greek fire where available;\n\n(d) Allied Vessels: Ships contributed by Venice, Genoa, Castile, or other allied powers operating under unified command.\n\n§3. Crews shall be drawn from:\n\n(a) Professional sailors in naval service;\n\n(b) Militia levies from maritime guilds (shipwrights, fishermen, sailors);\n\n(c) Coastal thematic populations in reconquered territories;\n\n(d) Allied contributions.\n\nArticle 24: Maritime Obligations\n\n§1. The guilds associated with maritime trades—shipwrights, rope makers, sailmakers, fishermen, and sailors—owe naval service in addition to or in place of wall militia service.\n\n§2. Coastal settlements in reconquered territories shall owe naval rather than land thematic service, providing:\n\n(a) Sailors proportional to population;\n\n(b) Ships according to capacity;\n\n(c) Harbor facilities and supplies for the fleet.\n\n§3. Pronoia grants including harbor revenues or coastal properties carry naval obligations—provision of ships or sailors rather than cavalry.\n\nTITLE VII: COMMAND AND CONTROL\n\nArticle 25: Unity of Command\n\n§1. All military forces operating under this Charter answer to the Defensor Romaniae. There shall be no independent commands, private armies, or forces answering to other authority.\n\n§2. When forces from allied nations serve alongside Roman forces:\n\n(a) Overall strategic command rests with the Defensor Romaniae;\n\n(b) Allied contingents retain their internal organization and immediate commanders;\n\n(c) Coordination mechanisms shall be established before each campaign;\n\n(d) Disputes over command shall be resolved by the Defensor or his designated deputy.\n\n§3.** No regional governor, city official, or noble may command military forces except by delegation from the Defensor Romaniae. The old system of independent strategoi with regional military authority is abolished.\n\nArticle 26: Summons and Assembly\n\n§1. When military need requires, the Defensor Romaniae issues summons specifying:\n\n(a) Which forces are called (militia, pronoia, thematic, professional, or all);\n\n(b) Where they shall assemble;\n\n(c) When they must arrive;\n\n(d) What equipment they must bring;\n\n(e) Expected duration of service if known.\n\n§2. Summons shall be communicated by:\n\n(a) Written orders to military officers;\n\n(b) Proclamation in public places;\n\n(c) Church announcements;\n\n(d) Beacon fires and bells for emergency mobilization.\n\n§3. Response times:\n\n(a) Constantinople militia: Two hours to assigned wall positions;\n\n(b) Pronoia cavalry: Seven days to designated assembly point;\n\n(c) Thematic forces: Fourteen days to designated assembly point;\n\n(d) Professional forces: Immediate, as stationed.\n\n§4. Failure to answer summons is punished as described in the relevant title of this Charter. Persistent failure constitutes desertion.\n\nArticle 27: Military Justice\n\n§1. Military courts established by the Defensor Romaniae have jurisdiction over:\n\n(a) All offenses committed by persons under arms;\n\n(b) All offenses committed against military personnel, property, or operations;\n\n(c) All failures of military obligation as defined in this Charter;\n\n(d) All matters of military discipline.\n\n§2. Military courts operate under procedures similar to the criminal procedures in the Charter of the Latin Courts, adapted for military necessity:\n\n(a) The accused shall know the charges;\n\n(b) The accused may speak in defense;\n\n(c) Evidence shall be weighed fairly;\n\n(d) Judgment shall be rendered promptly.\n\n§3. In the field during active campaign, summary justice may be administered for offenses requiring immediate response (desertion in face of enemy, cowardice, mutiny), with review available after the campaign concludes.\n\nTITLE VIII: SUPPLIES AND LOGISTICS\n\nArticle 28: Requisition Authority\n\n§1. The Defensor Romaniae may requisition supplies, transport, and materials necessary for military operations, including:\n\n(a) Grain, meat, wine, oil, and other provisions;\n\n(b) Horses, mules, donkeys, and oxen;\n\n(c) Wagons, carts, and boats;\n\n(d) Timber, metal, leather, and other materials;\n\n(e) Labor for military construction.\n\n§2. Requisitions shall be:\n\n(a) Proportional to need;\n\n(b) Distributed fairly across the population;\n\n(c) Compensated at fair rates from military funds;\n\n(d) Documented and recorded.\n\n§3. Abusive requisition—taking more than needed, targeting particular populations unfairly, failing to compensate—shall be punished as theft and abuse of authority.\n\nArticle 29: Military Treasury\n\n§1. A military treasury, separate from civil revenues, shall fund the forces under this Charter. Sources include:\n\n(a) Contributions under the Apokatastasis framework;\n\n(b) Fines collected for military offenses and failures;\n\n(c) Plunder from military operations (the Defensor's share);\n\n(d) Tribute imposed on defeated enemies;\n\n(e) Revenues from reconquered territories designated for military purposes;\n\n(f) Contributions from allied powers;\n\n(g) Such taxes as may be specifically designated for military use by imperial authority.\n\n§2. The military treasury shall be administered by officers appointed by the Defensor Romaniae, with accounting rendered annually.\n\nTITLE IX: RATIFICATION AND AMENDMENT\n\nArticle 30: Ratification\n\n§1. This Charter takes effect upon:\n\n(a) Acceptance by the Emperor of Constantinople, granting the title and authority of Defensor Romaniae; or\n\n(b) Acceptance by a lawful assembly of the Roman people, should circumstances prevent imperial action.\n\n§2. Until ratification, this Charter stands as a proposal and framework, to be refined as negotiations proceed.\n\nArticle 31: Amendment\n\n§1. This Charter may be amended by agreement between the Defensor Romaniae and the Emperor, or their lawful successors.\n\n§2. Amendments shall be published and proclaimed so that all affected persons may know their obligations.\n\nCONCLUSIO\n\nThe salvation of the Roman Empire requires sacrifice from all its people. The farmer must become a soldier. The noble must lead from the front. The merchant must contribute treasure. The priest must bless the cause. There are no exemptions, no exceptions, no escapes.\n\nBut sacrifice shared is sacrifice honored. Those who give shall be remembered. Those who fight shall be rewarded.

Aghv. \nIn the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen. \nPREAMBLE: THE TRUTH OF OUR CONDITION \nTo all who dwell within the walls of Constantinople—Greek and Latin, noble and common, clergy and layman, \nrich and poor—hear now the truth of our condition, spoken plainly and without concealment. \nThe Empire is dying. \nThis is not prophecy. This is not despair. This is fact, known to all who have eyes to see. \nWhere once the Roman Empire stretched from the Pillars of Hercules to the Euphrates, from the Danube to the \nNile, we now hold only this city and a few scattered fragments. Thessalonica has fallen. Adrianople has fallen. \nThe great cities of Anatolia—Nicaea, where the Creed was written; Ephesus, where the Theotokos was \nproclaimed—these are Turkish now. Our children are taken for the Sultan's armies. Our churches become \nmosques. Our people live as dhimmis, paying tribute for the privilege of remaining Christian. \nThe Turks will come for Constantinople. \nNot today. Perhaps not this year. But they will come. Sultan Murad II commands armies that dwarf anything we \ncan field. His cannon grow larger each year. His treasury fills while ours empties. He has been patient because \npatience costs him nothing. Time is his ally. Every year we grow weaker. Every year he grows stronger. \nWhen he decides the moment has come, our walls—the greatest walls in Christendom—will face bombardment \nsuch as they have never known. Our defenders—brave but few—will face numbers beyond counting. And \nunless something fundamental changes, Constantinople will fall as Thessalonica fell. As Adrianople fell. As a \nhundred cities have fallen before. \nThis is not meant to breed despair, but clarity. \nYou deserve to know the truth. You deserve to make your choice with open eyes. The comfortable lies—that \nGod will provide a miracle, that the West will send armies at the last moment, that somehow things will work \nout—these lies serve no one. They leave you unprepared for the storm that is coming. \nThere is still time to choose. \nThe Turks have not yet marched. The walls still stand. And from the West has come an offer—unprecedented, \nunexpected, and requiring careful consideration. \nJuan II, King of Castile and Leon, Conqueror of Granada, has brought nine hundred knights to Constantinople. \nHe has offered not merely temporary aid but permanent alliance. He has proposed not merely defense but \nrestoration—the recovery of lost Roman lands, the rebuilding of Roman power, the transformation of a dying \nempire into something that might live again. \nBut his offer comes with conditions. Significant conditions. Conditions that would change Constantinople \nforever. \nYou must choose. \nNot the Emperor alone. Not the nobles alone. Not the Patriarch alone. You—the people of Constantinople, in \nwhose hands the city's fate has always ultimately rested. \nThis document presents your choices. Read them. Debate them. Pray over them. And then decide what future \nyou will have. \nTHE THREE CHOICES \nCHOICE THE FIRST: Sanctuary in the West \nFor those who would leave: \nIfyou cannot accept the conditions of restoration, and cannot face the future alone, there is a third path: \ndeparture. \nKing Juan II offers sanctuary in his kingdom to any Greek who wishes to leave Constantinople before the storm \nbreaks. The terms are these: \nLand: The Kingdom of Granada, recently conquered from the Moors, has land in abundance. Greek families \nwho resettle will receive grants sufficient to support themselves—farms, workshops, homes. You will not arrive \nas beggars but as settlers with rights and property. \nCitizenship: Those who accept sanctuary become subjects of the Crown of Castile, with all the rights and \nprotections this entails. You will be taxed no differently than native Castilians. You will have access to the same \ncourts, the same markets, the same opportunities. \nReligion: Your Orthodox faith will be honored and protected. You may worship according to your traditions, \nmaintain your liturgy in Greek, raise your children in the faith ofyour fathers. The King of Castile does not \ndemand conversion. He asks only loyalty to the crown that shelters you. \nWhat you surrender: Constantinople. The Empire. The hope of restoration. You would leave as refugees, \npreserving your lives and your faith but abandoning the city that has been the heart of Orthodox Christendom \nfor eleven centuries. Your grandchildren will be Castilian, not Roman. The memory of Byzantium will fade into \nsongs and stories. \nT his choice is available to all. Noble or common, wealthy or poor. Ships will be provided for those who \nchoose this path. You may bring what you can carry. You will arrive in a land at peace, far from Turkish swords. \nBut you will never see the City again. \nCHOICE THE SECOND: To Stand Alone \nFor those who would refuse all foreign aid: \nIfyou cannot accept Latin help—ifthe memory of 1204 burns too hot, if the price of alliance seems too high, if \nyou would rather die Greek than live in a transformed city—you may refuse. \nKing Juan will honor this choice. He will complete the repairs to the walls that his knights have already begun. \nHe will leave such supplies as have been gathered. And then he will sail away, returning to his own wars and his \nown kingdoms, leaving Constantinople to face the future alone. \nWhat this means: \nThe walls will hold for a time. Perhaps years. Perhaps decades. The Turks may find other targets more tempting. \nMiracles are not impossible. \nBut understand clearly: no other army is coming. The West has sent its crusades before—they ended in disaster \nor betrayal. The Pope issues bulls and calls for aid; the princes of Europe ignore them. Ifyou refuse this offer, \nyou refuse the only substantial military force that has reached Constantinople in living memory. \nYou will face the Turks alone, with the forces you have now. Approximately five thousand men capable of \nbearing arms, to defend fourteen miles of walls against armies that may number a hundred thousand. \nThis is not meant as threat, but as truth. \nIfyou choose to stand alone, you choose with courage and pride. No one can take that from you. But you also \nchoose, in all probability, to fall. And when Constantinople falls, the slaughter of Thessalonica will be repeated. \nThree days of sack, by Ottoman custom. The men killed or enslaved. The women violated. The children taken. \nThe churches defiled. \nThis is what the Turks do. This is what they have done in every city they have taken. There is no reason to \nbelieve Constantinople will be different. \nChoose this path ifyou must. But choose it knowing what it means. \nCHOICE THE THIRD: The Restoration \nFor those who would fight to live: \nIfyou are willing to accept help—Latin help, with all that entails—there is a path to survival. More than \nsurvival: to restoration. To becoming again what the Roman Empire once was. \nBut this path demands much. Read carefully what acceptance means. \nPart I: The Defensor Romaniae \nYou would accept Juan II, King of Castile and Leon, as Defensor Romaniae—Defender of the Roman Realm. \nThis is not Emperor. The Emperor remains John VIII Palaiologos, isapostolos, God's vice-regent, sacred \nsovereign of the Roman people. The Defensor serves the Empire; he does not replace it. \nBut the Defensor would hold supreme military command. All armies. All navies. All forces raised for defense or \nrestoration would answer to him. The Old system of independent commanders, of nobles who field private \narmies answering only to themselves, would end. \nThe Defensor would have authority to: \n• Summon all persons owing military service \nAppoint and dismiss military officers \nDirect strategy and campaigns \nRequisition supplies for military necessity \nDistribute conquered lands according to established systems \nEnforce military justice \nThe Defensor would NOT have authority over: \n• \n• \nCivil governance of Constantinople (which remains Imperial) \nMatters of Orthodox faith and doctrine (which remain with the Church) \nOrdinary taxation (except that specifically designated for military purposes) \nCivil justice in non-military matters (except as provided in the Latin Courts charter) \nThis arrangement persists until the Empire can stand secure on its own foundations—a matter for the Defensor \nand Emperor to determine together when that day comes. \nPart II: Military Obligations \nEveryone fights. \nThis is not rhetoric. This is law. \nThe Urban Militia: Every able-bodied male resident between sixteen and fifty-five owes service in the city \nmilitia. No exceptions for wealth. No exceptions for rank. The noble's son and the baker's apprentice stand \ntogether on the walls. \nMonthly training required \nWall assignments for every unit \nEquipment provided by military stores \nPenalties for those who evade service \nThe Pronoia Obligations: Nobles who hold revenue grants owe military service proportional to their wealth. \nThe ancient system, long corrupted into mere collection of revenues without corresponding duty, would be \nrestored and enforced. \nNo noble may collect pronoia revenues without fulfilling military obligations \nHousehold guards must serve under the Defensor's command when summoned \nPersonal service required of great nobles, not merely provision of retainers \nPenalties up to forfeiture of grants for those who evade \nThe Thematic System: As territories are reconquered, soldier-farmers would be settled on the land, creating \nself-sustaining military forces. \n• \n• \nLand grants in exchange for military service \nTraining and equipment provided initially \nHereditary tenure so long as obligations are met \nOpportunity for common soldiers and militiamen to become landholders \nThe Professional Forces: A core of paid, full-time soldiers—the tagmata—would form the elite force for \noffensive operations. \nThe full details of military obligation are set forth in the Taktikon of Romania, available for examination by \nany who wish to understand precisely what service would be required. \nPart III: Justice and Law \nAcceptance means accepting a new legal order—one that treats Greek and Latin alike under common law. \nThe Charter of the Latin Courts establishes: \n• \n• \nCourts with jurisdiction over disputes between persons of different nations \nJudges drawn from nations not party to the dispute, ensuring impartiality \nThe lex mercatoria (merchant law) for commercial disputes \nByzantine law (Basilika) for criminal matters \nClear procedures for accusation, defense, evidence, and judgment \nEnforcement mechanisms that bind all subscribing nations \nFor Greeks, this means: \nAccess to fair courts when wronged by Latins \nProtection from arbitrary Latin justice administered only by Latins \nThe same law applying to all, regardless of origin \nFor Latins, this means: \nSecurity that their rights will be respected \nFair adjudication of disputes with Greeks \nA system they can trust to protect their interests \nThe principle is equality. No one stands above the law. No one is denied justice because oftheir birth. \nPart IV: Property Rights for Latins \nThis is perhaps the most difficult condition for many Greeks to accept. Read it carefully. \nLatins—Venetians, Genoese, Castilians, and others—would be permitted to own property throughout \nConstantinople, not merely within their traditional quarters. \nWhat this means: \nLatin merchants may purchase shops, warehouses, and homes in Greek neighborhoods \nLatin families may settle wherever they choose within the walls \nLatin churches may be built where congregations form \nProperty rights are protected by the Latin Courts system \nWhat this does NOT mean: \nLatins do not receive property taken from Greeks; they must purchase fairly \nLatins remain subject to the same laws as Greeks \nLatins pay the same taxes as Greeks \nNo special privileges beyond equality \nWhy this condition? \nBecause without it, Latins will not invest in Constantinople's future. They will not build, settle, raise families, or \nbind their fortunes to the city. They will remain temporary visitors, ready to flee when danger comes. \n1f Constantinople is to survive, it needs Latin gold, Latin ships, Latin soldiers. These will not come without \nsecurity of property. This is the price of alliance. \nSome will say this is the beginning of Latin conquest by commerce rather than arms. Perhaps. Or perhaps it is \nthe beginning of a true partnership—Greeks and Latins building something together that neither could build \nalone. \nYou must decide which you believe. \nPart V: Religion and Marriage \nNo one will be forced to change their faith. \nGreeks remain Orthodox. Latins remain Catholic. Each worships according to their tradition, in their own \nchurches, under their own clergy. The Defensor Romaniae, though Catholic himself, does not seek to impose \nRome's authority over Orthodox Christians. \nFor mixed marriages: \nWhen a man and woman of different faiths marry, the household chooses which faith to follow. This choice is \nmade at the moment of marriage—sealed by the church in which the wedding takes place. 1f married in an \nOrthodox church, the household is Orthodox. 1f married in a Latin church, the household is Latin. \nChildren follow the faith of the household. T hey may, as adults, choose to convert. But the household's faith is \nestablished at marriage and does not change thereafter. \nThis is compromise, not resolution. \nThe theological disputes between Rome and Constantinople—the Filioque, papal supremacy, the nature of \nchurch authority—remain unresolved. This document does not address them. Perhaps someday a true council \nwill heal the schism. Until then, we live side by Side, respecting each other's faith while maintaining our own. \nPart VI: The Church's Role \nAcceptance means accepting the framework established in the Tomos of the Apokatastasis. \nThe Orthodox Church would not be taxed. But the Church would be called to contribute voluntarily to the \nsacred cause of restoration: \n• \nGrain and Oil from monastery storehouses \nGold and silver from treasury reserves \nHorses, mules, and wagons from church lands \nMonks serving as healers, scribes, and chaplains \nThose who contribute—whether institutions or individuals—would have their names inscribed in the diptychs \nof restored churches, commemorated in the Divine Liturgy until Christ returns. \nThis is not indulgence. We do not promise forgiveness of Sins in exchange for gold. We promise remembrance \n—that those who gave shall not be forgotten. \nThe full theological framework is set forth in the Tomos, available for examination by clergy and laity alike. \nPart VII: Citizenship and Identity \nThis document does not resolve questions of citizenship and cultural identity. \nA Venetian who settles in Constantinople remains Venetian for now. A Greek remains Greek. As more \nnationalities mingle, as children are born of mixed marriages, new identities may emerge. Some may choose to \ncall themselves Roman—heirs to the ancient tradition that once united the Mediterranean world. \nFor now, these are matters of personal choice, not legal definition. There is no practical benefit to declaring \noneself Roman rather than Greek or Venetian. Perhaps benefits will develop over time. Perhaps they will not. \nWhat matters now is survival. Questions of identity can be debated by grandchildren who exist because we \nmade the hard choices today. \nPart VIII: The Alliance of Kingdoms \n1f Constantinople accepts the Defensor, the Defensor accepts Constantinople. \nJuan II is not merely King of Castile. 1--1e is heir presumptive to the throne of Aragon. 1--1is alliance already \nencompasses Naples, with its strategic position in the central Mediterranean. His marriage binds Castile to \nPortugal's maritime power. \n1f you choose restoration, you do not stand alone with nine hundred knights. \nYou become part of an alliance stretching from the Atlantic to your own shores. Castilian armies. Aragonese \nnavies. Neapolitan ports. The combined resources of the Western Mediterranean kingdoms, directed toward a \ncommon purpose. \nThe Defensor pledges: \nTo command the Mediterranean kingdoms he rules toward the defense and restoration of Constantinople \nTo bring Castile, Aragon, and Naples into alliance with the Roman Empire \nTo use these kingdoms together as building blocks for something greater—the restoration of Roman pride \nand honor across the Mediterranean world \nThis is not charity. This is partnership. The West needs the East; the East needs the West. Together, perhaps, we \nmay drive back the Ottoman tide. Separately, we fall one by one. \nTHE MANNER OF CHOOSING \nThe choice belongs to the people of Constantinople. \nNot to the Emperor alone—though his voice cames weight. \nNot to the Patriarch alone—though his blessing matters. \nNot to the nobles alone—though their resources are needed. \nTo all of you. \nThe choice will be presented in the Hippodrome, the ancient gathering place where the people of \nConstantinople have acclaimed and rejected emperors for a thousand years. \nThose who choose sanctuary in Castile will make themselves known and begin preparations for departure. \nThose who choose to stand alone will make themselves known, and the Defensor will complete his work on the \nwalls and sail away with honor. \nThose who choose restoration will make themselves known, and the work of transformation will begin. \nThere is no shame in any choice. \nTo leave is to preserve your families and your faith. To stand alone is to choose pride over submission. To \naccept restoration is to embrace change for the sake of survival. \nOnly you can decide what matters most. Only you can weigh the costs and benefits. Only you can determine \nwhat future you are Willing to fight for—or to flee from—or to accept. \nCONCLUSION \nThe hour is late, but not yet final. \nConstantinople has stood for eleven centuries. It has survived sieges, plagues, fires, earthquakes, and betrayals \nbeyond counting. It has outlasted empires that seemed invincible. It has risen from disasters that seemed \ninsurmountable. \nPerhaps it will rise again. \nBut not without choice. Not without sacrifice. Not without transformation. \nRead these terms. Understand them fully. Debate them freely. Pray for guidance. \nAnd then choose. \nThe documents referenced herein—the Tomos of the Apokatastasis, the Charter of the Latin Courts, and the \nTaktikon of Romania—are available for examination at the Palace of Blachernae, the Hagia Sophia, and such \nother locations as shall be designated. \nThe choice will be called in the Hippodrome on a day to be announced. \nUntil then, may God grant wisdom to all who must decide. \nSUBSCRIPTION \nOffered by: \nJuan II, by the Grace of God King of Castile, Leon, Toledo, Galicia, Seville, Côrdoba, Murcia, Jaén, the \nAlgarve, Algeciras, Gibraltar, and Granada; Lord of Vizcaya and Molina; 1--leir Presumptive to the Crown of \nAragon; Ally of the Kingdom of Naples \nWitnessed by: \nDemetrios Kantakouzenos, Strategos \nCommander of the Armies of Constantinople \nFather Gennadios Scholarios \nPriest and Scholar \nMarco Contarini \nBailo of the Most Serene Republic of Venice in Constantinople \nRaffaele Lomellini \nPodestà of the Most Serene Republic of Genoa in Constantinople \n[Additional witnesses as appropriate] \nAwaiting acceptance or rejection by the People of Constantinople and ratification by His Imperial \nMajesty John VIII Palaiologos, Emperor of the Romans. \n[END OF CHRYSOBULLI",

All lands reconquered within the historical Theme of Thrace—bounded by the walls of Constantinople to the east, the Rhodope Mountains to the north, the Aegean Sea to the south, and the Nestos River to the west—are hereby RESERVED for distribution exclusively to noble houses of Greek Roman origin.\n\nSection 2. This reservation applies to all grants of land, title, and lordship made as initial distribution following reconquest. No Latin lord, knight, or settler shall receive grants of land within Thrace under this initial distribution, regardless of their contributions to the Apokatastasis.\n\nSection 3. For the purposes of this decree, \"Latin\" includes all persons of Western Christian origin, including those who have elected Roman citizenship under the Chrysobull of the Choice. The purpose of this reservation is to restore the original Byzantine nobility; citizenship election does not alter this classification for purposes of initial land distribution.\n\nARTICLE II: RECOGNITION OF LATIN CONTRIBUTIONS\n\nSection 1. The contributions of Latin lords, knights, and soldiers to the Apokatastasis shall be documented fully and faithfully. Every man who fights, every florin contributed, every sacrifice made shall be recorded in the rolls of the Defensor.\n\nSection 2. These contributions create claims upon future conquests. When the Apokatastasis extends beyond Thrace—into Macedonia, into Anatolia, into territories yet to be reclaimed—Latin claimants shall receive grants proportional to their documented contributions.\n\nSection 3. No Latin contribution shall be forgotten or diminished by this reservation. The deferral of reward is not the denial of reward. Those who fight for the Empire shall receive their due, in lands beyond the Thracian boundary.\n\nARTICLE III: SECONDARY TRANSFERS\n\nSection 1. Following the initial distribution of Thracian lands to Greek houses, all restrictions on transfer are lifted. Greek lords holding Thracian grants may sell, trade, gift, or bequeath their holdings to any person, Latin or Greek, citizen or foreign, as they see fit.\n\nSection 2. The reservation applies only to the INITIAL distribution made by imperial and defensorial authority. Once land passes into private hands, it follows the ordinary laws of property applicable throughout the Empire.\n\nSection 3. No Greek lord shall be compelled to sell or transfer his Thracian holdings. This provision exists to permit voluntary transactions, not to enable forced acquisition.\n\nARTICLE IV: CRITERIA FOR GREEK GRANTS\n\nSection 1. Grants of Thracian land shall be made according to the principles established in the Taktikon of Romania: those who contribute more receive more, those who contribute less receive less, and those who contribute nothing receive nothing.\n\nSection 2. Priority in distribution shall consider:\n- The number and quality of soldiers committed to the Apokatastasis\n- The duration and faithfulness of service\n- Losses suffered in battle for the Empire's cause\n- Historical claims of families dispossessed by Ottoman conquest\n- The strategic importance of holdings and the grantee's ability to defend them\n\nSection 3. The Emperor, in consultation with the Defensor Romaniae, shall determine all grants. Disputes regarding distribution shall be adjudicated by the tribunals established under the Decree of the Defensor.\n\nARTICLE V: DURATION AND AMENDMENT\n\nSection 1. This reservation remains in force until the complete reconquest and distribution of the Theme of Thrace, or until amended by mutual agreement of the Emperor and the Defensor Romaniae.\n\nSection 2. Should the Apokatastasis extend beyond Thrace while Thracian distribution remains incomplete, new conquests shall be available for Latin grants while the Thracian reservation continues in parallel.\n\nSection 3. This decree may be amended, extended, or revoked only by joint action of the Emperor and the Defensor, or their lawful successors, with the consent of the noble houses affected thereby.\n\nWITNESS AND SEAL\n\nGiven under our hands and seals at Constantinople, in the presence of the assembled council, on the twelfth day of May in the year of Our Lord one thousand four hundred and thirty-four.\n\nIOANNES VIII PALAIOLOGOS\nImperator et Autocrator RhomaiÅn\n\nJUAN II OF CASTILE\nRex Castellae et Legionis, Defensor Romaniae\n\nWITNESSES:\n\nGeorgios Sphrantzes, Imperial Secretary\n\nThe Doukas Patriarch, speaking for House Doukas\n\nLord Bryennios, speaking for House Bryennios\n\nRaoul the Elder, Captain of the Tagmata\n\nKantakouzenos, Strategos of the Walls\n\nInscribed and sealed in the presence of the above witnesses.

      "full_text": "CHARTER OF JOINT TREASURY ADMINISTRATION\nCarta Administrationis Aerarii Coniuncti\n\nGiven at Constantinople, in the Palace of Blachernae\nThe Twelfth Day of May, in the Year of Our Lord 1434\n\nJOHN VIII PALAIOLOGOS, by the Grace of God Emperor and Autocrat of the Romans, together with JUAN II, by the Grace of God King of Castile and León, Defensor Romaniae, to all faithful Christians present and future, greeting and apostolic benediction.\n\nPREAMBLE\n\nWHEREAS the restoration of the Roman Empire, called the Apokatastasis, requires resources beyond what the Byzantine treasury alone can provide;\n\nAND WHEREAS the Defensor Romaniae has generously committed the resources of Castile to the cause of restoration, seeking partnership rather than dominion;\n\nAND WHEREAS effective defense and reconquest require unified administration of military resources, clear accounting, and mutual trust between the parties;\n\nAND WHEREAS both parties desire an arrangement that preserves Byzantine sovereignty and dignity while enabling the flow of Castilian resources to the common cause;\n\nNOW THEREFORE, by imperial authority and mutual agreement, we decree and establish the following:\n\nARTICLE I: ESTABLISHMENT OF JOINT ADMINISTRATION\n\nSection 1. For the duration of King Juan II's tenure as Defensor Romaniae, the treasuries of the Roman Empire and the Kingdom of Castile shall be administered jointly for all matters pertaining to defense, military expenditure, and the Apokatastasis.\n\nSection 2. This joint administration creates a common fund, hereinafter called the FUND OF THE APOKATASTASIS, from which all military expenses shall be drawn.\n\nSection 3. The Defensor Romaniae shall have authority to direct expenditures from the Fund of the Apokatastasis for purposes of defense, military recruitment, wall repair, armament, fleet construction, and all other matters necessary to the restoration of the Empire.\n\nARTICLE II: IMPERIAL RESERVED EXPENDITURES\n\nSection 1. The following categories of expenditure remain under the sole discretion of His Imperial Majesty and are NOT subject to joint administration:\n- The Imperial Household and its maintenance\n- Stipends for court officials and palace servants\n- Ceremonial expenses of the Empire\n- Personal expenses of the Imperial family\n- Such other civil expenditures as have been customary\n\nSection 2. These reserved expenditures shall be funded at their current levels from Byzantine revenues before any surplus flows to the Fund of the Apokatastasis.\n\nSection 3. As the prosperity of Constantinople increases through reformed revenues and expanded trade, the allocation for Imperial Reserved Expenditures may be increased by mutual agreement, reflecting the renewed dignity and capability of the Empire.\n\nARTICLE III: BYZANTINE CONTRIBUTIONS\n\nSection 1. All Byzantine revenues not allocated to Imperial Reserved Expenditures shall flow to the Fund of the Apokatastasis. These include but are not limited to:\n- Customs duties and harbor fees\n- Taxes on trade and commerce\n- Revenues from Latin residents under the Chrysobull of the Choice\n- Income from imperial properties and enterprises\n- Such other revenues as may be collected\n\nSection 2. The Defensor Romaniae is granted authority to reform the collection and administration of these revenues, with the purpose of increasing efficiency, reducing corruption, and maximizing income for the common cause.\n\nSection 3. A full accounting of current Byzantine revenues and expenditures shall be conducted within thirty days of this Charter's signing, establishing a baseline from which improvements may be measured.\n\nARTICLE IV: CASTILIAN CONTRIBUTIONS\n\nSection 1. The Kingdom of Castile commits to contribute its treasury surplus to the Fund of the Apokatastasis. This contribution represents the partnership of Castile in the restoration of the Roman Empire.\n\nSection 2. The Castilian contribution shall vary according to resources available. In years of plenty, the contribution shall be generous. In years of hardship—whether from drought, plague, war, or other calamity—the contribution may be reduced as necessity demands, without breach of this arrangement.\n\nSection 3. No fixed sum is inscribed as obligation. The commitment is to the principle of shared resources and common cause, not to a number that circumstances may render impossible.\n\nSection 4. In the initial years of the Apokatastasis, when investment is most urgently needed, the Defensor anticipates contributions exceeding fifty thousand florins annually. This reflects present intention, not binding obligation.\n\nARTICLE V: ACCOUNTING AND TRANSPARENCY\n\nSection 1. Full and accurate accounts shall be maintained of all contributions to and expenditures from the Fund of the Apokatastasis. Both Byzantine and Castilian officials shall have access to these records.\n\nSection 2. The Imperial Secretary, or such officer as the Emperor shall designate, shall maintain the Byzantine accounts. The Defensor shall designate a Castilian officer to maintain parallel records.\n\nSection 3. Accounts shall be reconciled quarterly, with discrepancies investigated and resolved. Neither party shall have cause to question the honesty of the administration.\n\nSection 4. Annual summaries shall be prepared showing: total revenues collected, total contributions from Castile, total expenditures by category, and remaining balance in the Fund.\n\nARTICLE VI: MILITARY COMMITMENTS\n\nSection 1. The Kingdom of Castile commits one thousand members of the Military Orders to the service of the Apokatastasis. These forces, together with their associated men-at-arms and support, shall serve the defense and restoration of the Empire.\n\nSection 2. This commitment of Military Order forces binds not only King Juan II but his successors. Should the Defensor fall, his heir—or regent acting for a minor heir—inherits both the title's authority and its obligations.\n\nSection 3. The wages, equipment, and maintenance of Castilian forces serving the Apokatastasis shall be drawn from the Fund of the Apokatastasis, not from Byzantine Reserved Expenditures.\n\nARTICLE VII: SUCCESSION AND CONTINUITY\n\nSection 1. Should King Juan II fall while serving as Defensor Romaniae, and should his heir Prince Fernando be a minor, King Alfonso V of Aragon is hereby recognized as Regent of Castile with full authority to maintain this arrangement.\n\nSection 2. All obligations established by this Charter pass to the Defensor's successors. The commitment to the Apokatastasis survives the death of any individual, continuing until the restoration is achieved or the arrangement is lawfully terminated.\n\nSection 3. Should circumstances require, the Emperor and the Defensor—or their lawful successors—may by mutual agreement modify these terms, name a new Defensor, or establish alternative arrangements for continuing the Apokatastasis.\n\nSection 4. The Apokatastasis is the goal; this Charter is the means. If the means must change to preserve the goal, both parties commit to good-faith negotiation of new arrangements.\n\nARTICLE VIII: SOVEREIGNTY PRESERVED\n\nSection 1. This Charter establishes partnership, not subjugation. The Roman Empire retains its sovereignty, its ancient rights, and its dignity undiminished.\n\nSection 2. The Emperor remains Emperor. His authority in civil matters, in appointments, in justice, in all things not pertaining to military defense, continues unimpaired.\n\nSection 3. The Defensor serves the Empire; he does not rule it. His authority extends to defense and restoration, not to governance. When the Apokatastasis is achieved, the relationship shall be renegotiated to reflect new circumstances.\n\nSection 4. Let it be recorded that this arrangement exists because it was offered generously and accepted freely—not extracted by force or demanded under duress. Constantinople chose this partnership; it was not imposed upon her.\n\nARTICLE IX: DURATION AND TERMINATION\n\nSection 1. This Charter remains in force for so long as the title of Defensor Romaniae is held by King Juan II or his lawful successors, and the Apokatastasis remains incomplete.\n\nSection 2. The Charter may be terminated by mutual agreement of both parties, with provisions made for the orderly separation of the treasuries and the settlement of any outstanding obligations.\n\nSection 3. Should the Apokatastasis be achieved—should the Roman Empire be restored to strength sufficient to defend itself without external aid—this Charter may be renegotiated or dissolved as circumstances warrant.\n\nSection 4. Neither party may unilaterally terminate this arrangement while the threat to Constantinople persists and the other party continues to fulfill its obligations in good faith.\n\nWITNESS AND SEAL\n\nGiven under our hands and seals at Constantinople, in the presence of the assembled council, on the twelfth day of May in the year of Our Lord one thousand four hundred and thirty-four.\n\nIOANNES VIII PALAIOLOGOS\nImperator et Autocrator RhomaiÅn\n\nJUAN II OF CASTILE\nRex Castellae et Legionis, Defensor Romaniae\n\nWITNESSES:\n\nGeorgios Sphrantzes, Imperial Secretary\n\nThe Doukas Patriarch, speaking for House Doukas\n\nLord Bryennios, speaking for House Bryennios\n\nRaoul the Elder, Captain of the Tagmata\n\nKantakouzenos, Strategos of the Walls\n\nInscribed and sealed in the presence of the above witnesses.

Ancient claims carry weight, for they\nrepresent the blood and sacrifice of ancestors. But parchment alone\nrebuilds no walls, mans no battlements, sails no ships. Therefore, we\nestablish this system whereby claims to lands, titles, and offices shall\nbe measured by contribution---the men, arms, ships, and personal valor\ncommitted to the cause of Christendom and the Empire.\n\nNo claim shall be granted by inheritance of theft. The disaster of 1204\nwas born of greed and treachery; titles granted by the Latin usurpers\nhold no weight in this court. All claimants---Greek and Latin\nalike---shall be judged by what they give, not merely what their\nancestors once took.\n\nPART I: THE CONTRIBUTION FORMULA\n\nArticle 1. Base Calculation\n\nA claimant's Contribution Strength shall be calculated thus:\n\nContribution Strength = (Weighted Troop Value × Claim Multiplier) +\nPersonal Service Bonus\n\nArticle 2.

Personal Service Bonus\n\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Condition                                         Bonus\n  ----------------------------------------------------- -----------------\n  Noble claimant fights personally in the campaign      +20\n\n  Noble claimant does not fight personally              +0\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNote: \"Fights personally\" means present in the field for the\ncampaigning season, bearing arms, subject to the same dangers as his\nmen.

Hulls rotting in harbor do not count.\n\nPART III: THE ANNUAL MUSTER\n\nArticle 6. Timing and Recording\n\nA muster shall be called annually at a time and place determined by the\nEmperor or the Defensor Romaniae. All claimants must present their\nforces for inspection. Men and vessels are counted before the year's\ncampaigning begins. The muster roll constitutes the official record of\ncontribution for that year. Cumulative contribution across multiple\nyears determines total claim strength.\n\nArticle 7. Service Obligation\n\nAll men counted at muster are bound to serve for the full campaigning\nyear. Desertion after muster is punishable by death. Early departure\nrequires formal written permission from the Emperor, the Defensor, or\ntheir designated commanders. Failure to obtain permission shall be\ntreated as desertion.\n\nArticle 8. Casualties\n\nA house's contribution is fixed at its muster count for that year.\nLosses suffered in battle do not reduce recorded contribution. Sacrifice\nis honored, not punished. A house that loses all its men in faithful\nservice retains full credit for that year's contribution.\n\nPART IV: FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTIONS\n\nArticle 9. Gold Alone Counts for Nothing\n\nNo claim shall be strengthened by gold, silver, or treasure alone.\nFinancial contribution is recognized only when converted to fighting men\nor ships. A lord who hires mercenaries and presents them at muster\nreceives full credit for those men. The Tribunal does not distinguish\nbetween household troops, feudal levies, or hired swords---only that\nthey fight.\n\nArticle 10. Prohibition of Fraud\n\nMen presented at muster must serve the full campaign. \"Muster and\nvanish\" fraud---presenting men who immediately depart---shall result\nin: forfeiture of all contribution credit for that year; forfeiture of\nany claim before the Tribunal; and possible criminal prosecution for\nfraud against the crown.\n\nPART V: APPLICATION OF CLAIMS\n\nArticle 11. Competing Claims\n\nWhen multiple claimants seek the same title or territory: First,\ncalculate each claimant's Contribution Strength per the formula above.\nSecond, the claimant with the higher total receives preference. Third,\nin cases of near-equal contribution, the Tribunal may consider duration\nof service, quality and conduct of service, and strategic value of the\nclaimant's continued loyalty.\n\nArticle 12. Minimum Thresholds\n\nThe Tribunal shall establish minimum contribution thresholds for titles\nof varying dignity:\n\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Title                                         Minimum\n                                                    Contribution\n                                                    Strength\n  ------------------------------------------------- ---------------------\n  Minor estate / village lordship                   25\n\n  Prokathemenos (district administrator)            50\n\n  Kephale (provincial governor)                     100\n\n  Doux (Duke / military governor)                   200\n\n  Megas Doux or equivalent                          400\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThese thresholds are guidelines. The Emperor and Defensor may adjust\nbased on strategic necessity.\n\nArticle 13. Patience Required\n\nClaims to territories currently under Ottoman control cannot be granted\nuntil those territories are reconquered. Claimants earn contribution\ncredit now; they receive their titles when Christian arms have liberated\nthe land.\n\nPART VI: SPECIAL PROVISIONS\n\nArticle 14. Rejection of 1204 Claims\n\nAll titles, grants, and claims originating from the Latin Empire\n(1204-1261) are hereby declared void. The Latin conquest was\nillegitimate; its grants carry no legal weight. Latin claimants are\nwelcome to earn titles through the contribution system on equal terms\nwith all others. Their ancestors' crimes are not held against\nthem---but neither do they benefit from stolen goods.\n\nArticle 15. Desperate Cases\n\nThe Emperor and the Defensor Romaniae reserve authority to grant special\ndispensation to: widows and orphans of men who died in service before\nthis system existed; aged or infirm persons who cannot fight but have\ndemonstrated loyalty; religious institutions that serve the common good;\nand any case where strict application of the formula would produce\nmanifest injustice. Such grants shall be examined individually and\nrecorded separately from the normal claims process.\n\nArticle 16. The Notaras Precedent\n\nLet it be recorded that the properties of the traitor Loukas Notaras,\nconvicted of proditio against the Empire, have been forfeit to the\nimperial treasury. Treason voids all claims. Those who treat with the\nenemy while claiming loyalty to the Empire shall lose everything.\n\nPART VII: ADMINISTRATION\n\nArticle 17. The Tribunal\n\nThe Tribunal Latinorum et Graecorum shall administer this system,\nmaintaining: the register of ancient claims; the annual muster rolls;\nthe cumulative contribution records; and the queue of pending claims\nawaiting reconquest.\n\nArticle 18. Appeals\n\nDecisions of the Tribunal may be appealed to the Emperor or, in matters\nconcerning Latin claimants, jointly to the Emperor and the Defensor\nRomaniae.\n\nArticle 19. Amendments\n\nThis Constitution may be amended only by joint decree of the Emperor and\nthe Defensor Romaniae, or their lawful successors.\n\nEXAMPLES OF APPLICATION\n\nExample 1: Established House with Ancient Claim\n\nHouse Bryennios claims ancestral estates near Adrianople. Ancient claim:\nYes (×3 multiplier). Men contributed: 40 infantry. Lord Bryennios fights\npersonally: Yes (+20). Calculation: (40 × 1 × 3) + 20 = 140\n\nExample 2: Wealthy House, Minimal Contribution\n\nHouse Doukas claims vast estates in Macedonia. Ancient claim: Yes (×3\nmultiplier). Men contributed: 11 infantry. Patriarch does not fight\npersonally: No (+0). Calculation: (11 × 1 × 3) + 0 = 33\n\nHouse Bryennios outranks House Doukas despite Doukas's greater paper\nclaims.\n\nExample 3: Latin Knight, No Ancient Claim\n\nDon Pedro de Rocafort claims Catalan Company holdings in Thessaly.\nAncient claim: No---derived from conquest (×1 multiplier). Men\ncontributed: 15 infantry. Fights personally: Yes (+20). Calculation: (15\n× 1 × 1) + 20 = 35\n\nDon Pedro outranks House Doukas.\n\nExample 4: Naval Contribution\n\nA maritime house contributes one war galley and 20 light cavalry. War\ngalley: 100 (infantry equivalent). Light cavalry: 20 × 3 = 60. Total\nweighted value: 160. If ancient claim (×3): 480. If no ancient claim\n(×1): 160.\n\nProclaimed under our hands and seals in the City of Constantinople,\n\nin the year of Our Lord 1434.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nJuan II of Castile, Defensor Romaniae\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nJohn VIII Palaiologos, Emperor of the Romans",

As I toil daily to seek His will, I\nfind inspiration in His great works and how those before me have built\ngreat monuments in His honour. How great it is that all who worship His\nname have such monuments available to praise Him.\n\nبصفتي ملكاً لاتينياً، كثيراً ما أُذكَّر بما يفرّق بيننا. بما يجعلنا مختلفين.\nوحين نرى ما هو مختلف لا نفهمه. ومن اليسير أن نكره ما لا نفهم. لكن الفهم\nهو ما أنشده.\n\nAs a Latin king, I am often reminded of what divides us. What makes us\ndifferent. And when we see that which is different we do not understand\nit. And it is easy to hate something we do not understand. But\nunderstanding is what I seek.\n\nأحقٌّ أن المسلمين يبجّلون عيسى نبياً؟ أثمة أوجه تشابه بين رؤيتنا لماهية الله\nورؤيتكم؟ أإبراهيم أيضاً من مؤسسي الإسلام؟ سبق أن طرحت هذه الأسئلة، لكنني\nتعلمت أن الطريقة التي يجيب بها المرء تكشف الكثير عنه. وأظن أنها ستكشف\nللآخر شيئاً عني أيضاً.\n\nIs it true that Muslims worship Jesus as a prophet? Are there\nsimilarities in our vision of what God is and yours? Is Abraham also a\nfounder of Islam? I have asked these questions before but I have learned\nthat how men answer these questions tells me a lot about them. As it\nwill, I suspect, tell the other something about me.\n\nلقد دخلت مؤخراً في اتفاق مع الإمبراطورية البيزنطية بشأن التجارة والأمن.\nليس سراً أن خزينتها خاوية، وأنه بمساعدتي سيُدفع الجزية دون عناء.\n\nI have recently entered into an agreement with the Byzantine Empire\nregarding trade and security. It is no secret that their treasury is\nempty and that with my help the tribute obligation shall be paid without\ntrouble.\n\nآمل أن ألقاك حين أحمل الجزية. لقاء شخصي على أرض محايدة من اختيارك يؤكدها\nإقراري. إن جلال منصبينا يقتضي ألا يسلّم أيٌّ منا نفسه في عهدة الآخر. أرجو\nأن تتفهم هذا ولا أقصد إساءة بالإشارة إليه. أنتظر ردك.\n\nI hope that I can meet you when I deliver the tribute. A meeting in\nperson on neutral grounds of your choosing to be confirmed by me. The\nmajesty of both our positions demands that neither surrenders himself\ninto the custody of the other. I hope you understand this and I mean no\noffence pointing this out. I await your response.\n\nحتى نلتقي،\n\nUntil we meet,\n\nيوحنا ملك قشتالة\n\nIoannes of Castile",

All funds shall be held and\nadministered as one.\n\nArticle II --- Administration\n\nThe Defensor Romaniae, or such Sakellarios as he shall designate, shall\nadminister the Joint Treasury with full authority to collect, disburse,\ninvest, and manage all funds therein for the defense, restoration, and\nprosperity of the Empire and its territories.\n\nProvided, however, that for any single expenditure exceeding five\nthousand florins, or for any ongoing commitment exceeding five thousand\nflorins annually, the Emperor shall be consulted prior to such\nexpenditure being authorized. This consultation shall be genuine and\nsubstantive, though the final authority to approve or deny such\nexpenditures shall rest with the Defensor. The Emperor's counsel shall\nbe sought and considered in good faith.\n\nProvided further, that before any Sakellarios is appointed to\nadminister the Joint Treasury, the Emperor shall be consulted regarding\nsuch appointment. The Sakellarios, whosoever he may be, shall have\nassigned to him at least one deputy of Greek birth and Orthodox faith,\nsuch deputy to be nominated by the Emperor, who shall serve to advise\nthe Sakellarios on matters of custom, precedent, and local practice, and\nto ensure that the administration of the Treasury proceeds with full\nknowledge of the traditions and expectations of the Roman people.\n\nArticle III --- Imperial Stipend\n\nThe Emperor shall receive from the Joint Treasury an annual stipend of\ntwenty-two thousand florins, payable in quarterly installments of five\nthousand five hundred florins each, on the first day of January, April,\nJuly, and October. This stipend is guaranteed in perpetuity and shall\nnot be reduced, delayed, or encumbered without the mutual written\nconsent of both the Emperor and the Defensor. This stipend shall be the\nfirst obligation of the Treasury, taking precedence over all other\ndisbursements save only the immediate defense of Constantinople against\nactive military assault.\n\nArticle IV --- Imperial Dignity\n\nNothing in this Chrysobull shall be construed to diminish, reduce, or\nimpair the sacred dignity of the Imperial office. The Emperor remains\nEmperor and Autocrat of the Romans, Basileus kai Autokrator ton\nRomaion, with all titles, honors, precedences, and ceremonies\npertaining thereto. The Defensor serves the Empire; he does not supplant\nit. All public acts shall honor the Emperor's supreme dignity, and the\nEmperor shall preside over all ceremonies of state as is fitting for the\nheir of Constantine and Justinian.\n\nArticle V --- Guardianship and Succession\n\nThis Chrysobull shall bind all successors to both the Imperial throne\nand the office of Defensor Romaniae, continuing in force until such time\nas both parties mutually agree to amend or dissolve these arrangements.\n\nIn the event that the Imperial line of Palaiologos should fail\nentirely, with no legitimate male heir of the blood surviving to assume\nthe Imperial dignity, the Defensor Romaniae shall assume guardianship\nover all obligations, institutions, and dignities of the Empire. The\nDefensor shall preserve, protect, and administer all that pertains to\nthe Roman state, holding it in trust for Christendom.\n\nProvided, however, that any assumption of the Imperial dignity\nitself---the sacred title of Emperor and Autocrat of the Romans, the\nwearing of the purple, and the receiving of Imperial acclamation---shall\nrequire:\n\n> First, the confirmation and blessing of the Patriarch of\n> Constantinople, who shall attest that such assumption is proper,\n> lawful, and pleasing to God;\n>\n> Second, the acclamation of such nobility, military commanders, and\n> representatives of the people as remain to speak for the Roman nation.\n\nUntil such confirmation and acclamation are obtained, the Defensor shall\nrule as Guardian and Protector, not as Emperor, preserving the forms and\ninstitutions of the Empire against the day when a worthy successor may\nbe acclaimed according to the ancient customs of the Roman people.\n\nArticle VI --- Ratification\n\nThis Chrysobull shall take effect upon the affixing of both the Imperial\nseal of the Palaiologoi and the royal seal of Castile and León. Two\ncopies shall be made: one to be kept in the Imperial archives at\nConstantinople, one to be kept in the royal archives at Toledo. Both\ncopies shall have equal force and authority.\n\nDatum et actum Constantinopoli, mense Martio, Anno Domini MCDXXXV.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nIOANNES VIII PALAIOLOGOS\n\nBasileus kai Autokrator ton Romaion\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nJUAN II OF CASTILE AND LEÓN\n\nDefensor Romaniae\n\nWitnesses\n\nDemetrios Kantakouzenos, Strategos of the Walls of Constantinople\n\nDon Juan de Sotomayor, Master of the Order of Alcántara\n\nGeorgios Sphrantzes, Megas Doux of the Roman Fleet\n\nAlexios Philanthropenos, Commander of the Gate of Charisius\n\n☧ ☧ ☧\n\nIn Nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti.

      "full_text": "بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم\n\nIn the Name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful\n\nPROPOSAL OF TRUCE AND ACCOMMODATION\n\nFrom the Sublime Porte of the Ottoman Sultanate\n\nTo His Majesty Juan II, King of Castile and León\n\nDelivered by the Hand of Çandarlı Halil Pasha, Grand Vizier\n\nThe Month of Rajab, 838 AH / April 1435 AD\n\nPREAMBLE\n\nHis Imperial Majesty Sultan Murad Han, Shadow of God upon Earth,\nCommander of the Faithful, Sovereign of the House of Osman, has\nconsidered with great deliberation the meeting at Tenedos and the words\nspoken there between sovereign and sovereign.\n\nThe Sultan observed in the King of Castile a man of conviction and\nhonor---one who speaks plainly and does not dissemble, who demands much\nbut offers the courtesy of honest speech. Such men are rare among the\nprinces of the West, where promises are written in water and treaties\nlast only until convenience dictates otherwise.\n\nThe King of Castile declared that only the way of arms remains between\nus. Perhaps this is so. Perhaps God has ordained that our peoples must\nmeet in blood until one prevails. Yet even the Prophet, peace be upon\nhim, made treaty with his enemies when wisdom counseled it, and broke no\noath he had sworn.\n\nTherefore, before the sword is drawn and cannot be sheathed, the Sultan\noffers this: a pause. Not surrender---never surrender. Not retreat---the\nHouse of Osman does not retreat. But a truce of defined duration, in\nwhich both parties may pursue their interests without the waste of war,\nand in which the will of God may become clearer to those who seek it.\n\nIf the King of Castile finds merit in this proposal, let him send word.\nIf he does not, then let him come with his armies, and we shall meet as\nhe promised---before the face of God, with open visor.\n\nARTICLE I: DURATION AND SCOPE OF TRUCE\n\n§1. Duration\n\nThis truce, if accepted, shall endure for a period of ten years from the\ndate of ratification, to be renewed by mutual agreement or to expire\nwithout renewal, as the parties shall determine.\n\n§2. Geographic Scope\n\nThe truce shall apply to all territories currently held by the Ottoman\nSultanate and to the city of Constantinople with its immediate environs,\nas well as to the territories of Castile, León, and Granada. It shall\nfurther apply to all waters of the Aegean Sea, the Sea of Marmara, and\nthe Straits of the Dardanelles and Bosphorus.\n\n§3. Parties Bound\n\nThe Ottoman Sultanate shall be bound by this truce in all its actions.\nThe King of Castile shall be bound in his own name and in his capacity\nas Defensor Romaniae, such that the forces under his command or\ndirection in the East shall observe its terms.\n\nARTICLE II: TERRITORIAL STATUS\n\n§1. Recognition of Present Holdings\n\nFor the duration of this truce, both parties agree to recognize the\npresent territorial disposition without prejudice to future claims. The\nOttoman Sultanate retains all territories currently under its\nadministration. The Byzantine Empire, under the protection of the\nDefensor Romaniae, retains Constantinople and such territories as it\npresently holds.\n\n§2. No Offensive Operations\n\nNeither party shall conduct offensive military operations against the\nterritories of the other. This includes siege, assault, raid, naval\nattack, or any other act of war. Defensive preparations within one's\nown territory are not prohibited.\n\n§3. Settlement and Fortification\n\nThe settlement of Latin Christians in Constantinople may continue,\nprovided such settlers do not bear arms against Ottoman territories. The\nrepair and maintenance of existing fortifications is permitted; the\nconstruction of new fortifications beyond the existing walls of\nConstantinople is not.\n\nARTICLE III: COMMERCE AND PASSAGE\n\n§1. Freedom of the Straits\n\nMerchant vessels of all nations allied to the King of Castile shall\nenjoy free passage through the Dardanelles and Bosphorus, subject to\npayment of customary tolls at rates no higher than those charged to\nVenetian or Genoese merchants.\n\n§2. Trade Relations\n\nMerchants of Castile, and of such other Christian nations as the King of\nCastile shall designate, may trade freely in Ottoman ports under the\nsame terms extended to other Christian merchants. Ottoman merchants may\nlikewise trade in the ports of Castile and its allies.\n\n§3. War Vessels\n\nWarships of either party may transit the Straits in numbers not\nexceeding ten vessels at one passage, with prior notification to the\nother party. Fleets exceeding this number shall be considered a hostile\nact and void this truce.\n\nARTICLE IV: TREATMENT OF SUBJECTS\n\n§1. Christian Subjects of the Sultan\n\nChristian subjects dwelling in Ottoman territories shall continue to\npractice their faith according to established custom. Churches presently\nin use shall not be converted to other purposes. The Patriarch of\nConstantinople in exile, should he wish to return, shall be permitted to\ndo so and to exercise his spiritual office among Orthodox Christians in\nOttoman lands.\n\n§2. Muslim Subjects of the King\n\nMuslim subjects dwelling in the territories of the King of Castile,\nparticularly in the former Emirate of Granada, shall be permitted to\npractice their faith according to established custom, consistent with\nthe laws of Castile. Mosques presently in use shall not be converted to\nother purposes without just compensation.\n\n§3. Prisoner Exchange\n\nAll prisoners of war currently held by either party shall be released\nwithin sixty days of ratification, without ransom. Future captures made\nbefore word of the truce has spread shall likewise be released upon\nidentification.\n\nARTICLE V: DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS\n\n§1. Ambassadors\n\nBoth parties agree to exchange permanent ambassadors who shall reside at\nthe court of the other sovereign. These ambassadors shall enjoy full\ndiplomatic immunity and the right to communicate freely with their home\ncourts.\n\n§2. Resolution of Disputes\n\nDisputes arising under this truce shall be referred first to the\nresident ambassadors. If they cannot resolve the matter, it shall be\nsubmitted to a joint tribunal of three judges---one appointed by each\nparty, and a third agreed upon by both.\n\n§3. Notification of Termination\n\nShould either party wish to terminate this truce before its natural\nexpiration, they shall provide one year's notice to the other party.\nDuring this final year, all terms remain in force. No offensive\noperations may commence until the notice period has expired.\n\nARTICLE VI: WHAT THIS TRUCE IS NOT\n\nThe Sultan wishes to speak plainly, as the King of Castile spoke plainly\nat Tenedos.\n\nThis truce does not represent Ottoman recognition of Latin claims to\nByzantine territory. It does not represent abandonment of Ottoman\ninterests in Constantinople or the lands of Romania. It does not\nrepresent Ottoman acceptance of the title 'Defensor Romaniae' as\nconferring any legitimate authority.\n\nThis truce is a pause---nothing more. The Sultan's position remains as\nstated at Tenedos: the House of Osman will not surrender what it has\nwon. When this truce expires, if no renewal is agreed, matters will\nstand as they stood before---to be resolved by the will of God and the\nstrength of arms.\n\nThe King of Castile made clear his own position. He believes God has\nchosen him to restore Christian lands. The Sultan does not expect this\ntruce to change that belief. He offers it because even those destined to\nfight may benefit from time---time to prepare, time to consider, time to\ndetermine whether God's will is truly as clear as both believe.\n\nCLOSING\n\nIf these terms find favor with the King of Castile, he may signify his\nacceptance by sending his sealed response to the Grand Vizier through\nany channel he deems appropriate. The Sultan's ambassador will await\nreply at Rhodes, where the Knights of the Hospital have agreed to serve\nas neutral intermediaries.\n\nIf these terms do not find favor, then let the King of Castile know that\nthe Sultan received his words at Tenedos with the respect due to an\nhonest enemy. When they meet again---if God wills that they should\nmeet---it will be as the King proposed: before the face of God, with\nhonor observed on both sides.\n\nوالله ولي التوفيق\n\nAnd God is the Guardian of Success.\n\nGiven under the Tughra of His Imperial Majesty\n\nMURAD HAN\n\nSultan of the Ottoman Empire\n\nShadow of God upon Earth\n\nCommander of the Faithful\n\nWitnessed and delivered by:\n\nÇANDARLI HALİL PASHA\n\nGrand Vizier of the Ottoman Empire\n\nSealed at Edirne, in the Month of Rajab, 838 AH\n\nApril, in the Year of Our Lord 1435",

      "full_text": "KINGDOM OF CASTILE\n\nComprehensive Economic Development Plan\n\n1435 -- 1440\n\nPrepared by Diego de Daza, Chief Financial Administrator\n\nUnder the Authority of His Majesty King Juan II\n\nGM Reference Document --- Late Summer 1435\n\nI. OVERVIEW\n\nThis document consolidates all economic development initiatives\nundertaken by the Crown of Castile beginning in the summer of 1434. The\nplan encompasses domestic industry expansion, foreign expert\nrecruitment, infrastructure investment, and naval development. All\nprojections cover the period 1435-1440.\n\nThe Junta de Manufacturas oversees industrial development. Diego de Daza\ncoordinates implementation with regular reporting to the Crown. Admiral\nDon Berenguer de Vilaragut directs naval development under a separate\nplan.\n\nKey Strategic Goals:\n\n-   Capture value from raw materials by processing domestically rather\n    than exporting\n\n-   Reduce dependence on foreign imports for strategic goods (arms,\n    glass, textiles)\n\n-   Expand fishing and Atlantic trade through naval investment\n\n-   Build infrastructure to support herding expansion and commercial\n    growth\n\n-   Develop capacity for Constantinople settlement and military\n    projection\n\nII\\. DOMESTIC INDUSTRIES\n\nThese industries utilize existing Castilian expertise and require\ninvestment and coordination rather than foreign knowledge.\n\nA. Leather Industry (Córdoba)\n\nRepresentative: Rodrigo de Montilla, Master of the Gremio de\nCurtidores\n\nStatus: Existing industry, world-famous for cordobanes and\nguadamecíes\n\nInitiatives:\n\n-   Sumac cultivation --- deliberate plantations to secure tanning\n    supply (3-5 years to maturity)\n\n-   Hide production expansion --- tied to goat herd growth (see Herding\n    section)\n\n-   New tannery facility outside Córdoba city --- removes stench, allows\n    expansion\n\n-   Guadamecí workshop expansion --- finishing workshops in Toledo and\n    Seville\n\n-   Workforce tied to capacity --- apprenticeships expand as hide supply\n    grows\n\nInvestment: 3,000 florins (1434, one-time). Infrastructure costs\nincluded in general program.\n\nB. Silk Industry (Granada)\n\nRepresentatives: Hernán de Úbeda (merchant), Yusef al-Rashid (Muslim\nsilk master)\n\nStatus: Existing industry at 75-85% pre-war capacity; recovering\n\nProblem: One-third of silk thread sold raw to Genoese middlemen who\ncapture weaving profits\n\nInitiatives:\n\n-   50 additional silk looms --- weave all thread into cloth\n    domestically\n\n-   Retrain wool/linen weavers for silk work with master supervision\n\n-   Expand dye workshop capacity --- dyed cloth commands premium prices\n\n-   Amān granted --- security guarantee for Muslim and Christian workers\n\nInvestment: 3,250 florins (1434, one-time: looms 2,250 + training\n500 + dyes 500). Annual: 400 florins (master supervision).\n\nC. Salt & Fishing Industry (Seville)\n\nRepresentatives: Gonzalo Pérez de Medina (Cofradía de Mareantes),\nAlonso de Marchena (Factor)\n\nStatus: Crown holds salt monopoly; fishing limited by small coastal\nvessels\n\nInitiatives:\n\n-   Ocean-going fishing fleet --- 8 smaller vessels (40-50 tons), 2\n    larger vessels (80-100 tons)\n\n-   Lease model --- fishermen lease vessels at 15-20 florins/year\n    (small) or 30-40 florins/year (large)\n\n-   Ownership transfer after 20 years of lease payments and self-funded\n    maintenance\n\n-   Atlantic exploration --- assess waters between Castile and Canary\n    Islands\n\nInvestment: 2,700 florins (1434, one-time). Lease revenue \\~210\nflorins/year.\n\nD. Ceramics Industry (Talavera)\n\nStatus: Existing industry producing fine ceramics\n\nMeasures Taken: None. Industry continues at current production\nlevels. No expansion planned without specific Crown initiative.\n\nE. Wool & Goat Herding (Raw Materials)\n\nRepresentatives: Don Alonso de Aguilar (Mesta), Martín Sánchez de\nPriego (Goatherds)\n\nInitiatives:\n\n-   Terrain division in Granada --- mountains for goats, lowlands for\n    sheep\n\n-   Legal recognition for goatherds --- royal charter granting formal\n    standing\n\n-   Infrastructure improvements --- drove roads, watering points, new\n    routes into Granada\n\n-   Hide supply for leather industry; meat preserved for military\n    provisions\n\nInvestment: Included in Infrastructure Program (12,000-15,000\nflorins/year allocated to herding infrastructure).\n\nIII\\. FOREIGN EXPERT INDUSTRIES\n\nThese industries require expertise not currently available in Castile.\nThe Crown has recruited foreign masters to establish workshops and train\nCastilian apprentices. Results vary based on quality of experts\nattracted (determined by dice rolls).\n\nA. Arms & Armor Workshops (Bilbao)\n\nRoll: 74/100 --- GOOD\n\nMaster: Heinrich Steinmann of Augsburg, with brother-in-law (blades)\nand mail-maker Konrad Fels\n\nLocation: Bilbao (iron access)\n\nFocus: Practical military equipment --- hauberks, brigandines,\nsallets, good steel blades. 'Weapons for soldiers, not for display.'\n\nProduction Capacity:\n\n-   Years 1-2: \\~200 complete soldier's kits annually\n\n-   Year 5: 500-800 kits annually with trained Castilian workers\n\nInvestment: 8,900 florins (1435, one-time: workshop 8,000 + housing\n900). Annual: 3,500 florins (retainer 1,500 + guaranteed purchases\n2,000).\n\nB. Textile Workshops (Segovia)\n\nRoll: 24/100 --- POOR\n\nMasters: Willem van der Berg, Pieter de Smet, Joos Claesen ---\njourneymen of limited skill\n\nAssessment: Second-rate craftsmen who could not succeed at home. Van\nder Berg never achieved master status in Bruges. De Smet's credentials\npurchased. Claesen's origin unclear.\n\nOutcome: Single modest workshop established. Marginal improvement\nover existing Castilian methods. Provides foundation for future true\nmaster.\n\nInvestment: 2,600 florins (1435, one-time: workshop 2,000 + housing\n600). Annual: 400 florins (retainer only, no guaranteed purchases).\n\nAction: Continue search for true Flemish masters through Medici bank\nand Burgundian court contacts.\n\nC. Glass Workshop (Burgos)\n\nRoll: 85/100 --- SUCCESS\n\nMaster: Alessandro Barbarigo of Venice (Murano)\n\nSpecialty: Cristallo (clear glass), colored glass, mirrors, vessel\nwork --- genuine Venetian quality\n\nBackground: Minor branch of noble Barbarigo family. Master\nglassblower for 19 years. Fled after Venice 'disappeared' his son. No\nfamily hostages remaining.\n\nSecurity: SECRET OPERATION. Smuggled via Ragusa-Ancona-Genoa-Bilbao\nroute by Isaac de Baeza's network. Workshop location in Burgos kept\ndiscreet. Guards posted.\n\nDiplomatic Risk: Venice will protest when they discover his\nlocation. Assassination attempts possible but difficult in distant\nCastile.\n\nTimeline: Estimates 10 years of productive work (eyes beginning to\nfail). Can train Castilian apprentices in techniques Venice has guarded\nfor centuries.\n\nInvestment: 7,300 florins (1435, one-time: smuggling 500 + workshop\n6,000 + housing 800). Annual: 1,200 florins (retainer 800 + security\n400).\n\nD. Paper Mills\n\nRoll: 7/100 --- DISASTER\n\nCandidates: Guillaume Fournier and Jean de Moulins of Troyes ---\nfrauds expelled from guild for incompetence\n\nOutcome: Demonstration produced unusable paper --- uneven, riddled\nwith holes, ink bleeds. Sent away after minor hospitality expenses (\\~50\nflorins).\n\nInvestment: \\~50 florins lost (hospitality only).\n\nAction: Retry 1436 through German contacts (Nuremberg/Augsburg) with\nrigorous credential verification.\n\nIV\\. INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAM\n\nAdministrator: Diego de Daza\n\nDuration: Five years (1434-1438)\n\nBudget: 40,000 florins annually (200,000 total)\n\nAllocation:\n\n  ----------------------------------- ----------------- -----------------\n  Category                        Annual        Purpose\n\n  Herding Infrastructure              12,000-15,000     Drove roads,\n                                                        watering, Granada\n                                                        routes\n\n  General Commerce                    25,000-28,000     Ports, roads,\n                                                        bridges,\n                                                        facilities\n  ----------------------------------- ----------------- -----------------\n\nPriority Projects:\n\n-   Cañada real bridge repairs and drove road maintenance\n\n-   Watering point expansion (wells, river access)\n\n-   Mountain passes into Granada highlands\n\n-   Road to new Córdoba tannery facility\n\n-   Port improvements for fishing and trade fleets\n\n-   Major trade route improvements\n\nOversight: Independent oversight, milestone payments, penalties for\nfraud.\n\nV.

Grows with fleet expansion.\n\nArms: Reduced imports, some noble purchases. Strategic value exceeds\ndirect revenue. Slow start (workshop establishment).\n\nTextiles: Minimal --- poor quality masters produce marginal\nimprovement only.\n\nGlass: Luxury goods for wealthy buyers. Reduced imports, potential\nexports. Slow start (secret establishment, ramping production).\n\nNaval/Trade: More ships → more trade → more customs. More fishing\nvessels → more fish → more alcabala. Reduced piracy → safer trade → more\nmerchants. Largest single revenue driver.\n\nInfrastructure: Better roads/bridges → faster trade → more customs.\nBenefits compound over time as network improves.\n\nC.

It distinguishes between crown-owned enterprises and privately-operated ventures receiving crown subsidies.\n\nTotal Economic Development Investment (1434-1435): ~68,000 florins\nAnnual Recurring Costs (1435): ~11,100 florins\nProjected Annual Revenue from New Industries (1435): ~7,000 florins\n\nPart I: Crown-Owned Industries\n\nThese industries are directly owned and operated by the Crown, with revenues flowing to the royal treasury.\n\n1. Paper Mills (Segovia & Toledo)\n\nStatus: OPERATIONAL (Exceptional Success - Roll 88)\nYear Established: 1435\n\n| Item | Detail |\n|------|--------|\n| Investment (1435) | 10,000 florins total |\n| Annual Operating Costs | ~1,500 florins (materials, wages) |\n| Annual Revenue | 4,000 florins gross / ~2,500 florins net |\n| Production | 700 reams/year combined |\n\nThe Two Mills:\n\nSegovia Mill (Wilhelm Hartmann, German)\n- Focus: Functional paper for correspondence, legal documents, ledgers\n- Capacity: 500 reams/year\n- Revenue: 1,800 florins/year\n- Specialty: High volume, consistent quality\n- Apprentices: 6 Castilians training in German methods\n\nToledo Mill (Marco da Pescia, Italian)\n- Focus: Fine paper for royal documents, books, diplomatic use\n- Capacity: 200 reams/year\n- Revenue: 2,200 florins/year\n- Specialty: Exceptional quality, royal watermark\n- Apprentices: 4 Castilians training in Italian methods\n\nStrategic Impact:\n- Paper self-sufficiency achieved for functional paper\n- Fine paper imports reduced by 75%\n- Crown paper costs reduced by 40%\n- Portuguese merchants inquiring about exports\n- Both German and Italian techniques now in Castile\n- First Castilian journeymen expected in 3-4 years\n\nFuture Projections:\n| Year | Revenue (fl) | Notes |\n|------|-------------|-------|\n| 1436 | 4,000 | Full production |\n| 1437 | 4,500 | Efficiency improvements |\n| 1438 | 5,000 | First apprentices contributing |\n| 1440 | 6,000 | Possible third mill |\n\n2. Wool Breeding Program (Royal Flocks)\n\nStatus: IN PROGRESS (Adequate Success - Roll 42)\nYear Established: 1435\n\n| Item | Detail |\n|------|--------|\n| Investment (Year 1, 1435) | 5,900 florins |\n| Projected Investment (Years 2-3) | ~12,000 florins additional |\n| Immediate Revenue | None (long-term investment) |\n\nYear One Results:\n- 20 English rams purchased\n- 16 arrived healthy (4 died during sea crossing)\n- Breeds: 6 Ryelands (finest), 5 Cotswolds, 5 Lincolns\n- 640 ewes bred at Segovia\n\nTimeline:\n| Year | Milestone |\n|------|-----------|\n| 1437 | First crossbred lambs born |\n| 1438 | First improved wool clip |\n| 1440 | Second-generation breeding |\n| 1445 | Castilian wool approaches English quality |\n\nStrategic Impact:\n- Foundation laid for wool quality transformation\n- Genetic diversity established (multiple English breeds)\n- Channels for Year Two acquisition identified\n- Lessons learned: verify bloodlines, ship in smaller groups, avoid Southampton\n\nLong-term Projection:\nWithin 10 years, Castilian wool could equal English quality. Shepherds will remember Juan as \"the king who made our wool worth something.\"\n\nPart II: Crown-Subsidized Private Industries\n\nThese industries are owned and operated by private masters or guilds, receiving crown subsidies, guaranteed purchases, or other support. Revenues accrue to the operators, with the crown benefiting through taxes, reduced imports, and economic growth.\n\n3. Textile Workshop (Segovia)\n\nStatus: ESTABLISHING (Exceptional Success - Roll 87)\nYear Established: 1435\n\n| Item | Detail |\n|------|--------|\n| Investment (1435) | 5,500 florins one-time |\n| Annual Subsidy | 500 florins (guaranteed purchases) |\n| Projected Revenue (to masters) | 1,500 florins (1436), growing to 6,000 (1440) |\n| Crown Revenue | Alcabala on production (~5% of sales) |\n\nThe Ghent Consortium:\nThree masters who fled guild politics in Ghent together:\n- Gillis de Coninck (52) - Master weaver, fine woolen broadcloths, specialized looms\n- Arnout van Steenbergen (48) - Master fuller, trade secret fulling mixtures\n- Mathijs Coppens (44) - Master dyer, renowned crimson, mordant expertise\n\nWhy They Left: Ghent city council export restrictions strangled their businesses after public protest. Planning departure together—each is part of complete production chain.\n\nTerms:\n- Workshop complex in Segovia (4,000 florins)\n- Housing for families (1,000 florins)\n- Guaranteed 500 florins/year crown purchases for 3 years\n- Hidalguía after 5 years of service\n- Right to establish guild\n- Protection from Flemish retaliation\n\nStrategic Impact:\n- Complete cloth-making capability: wool in, finished fabric out\n- Can train Castilian apprentices in techniques that were guild secrets for generations\n- Major reduction in cloth imports within 3 years\n- Quality improving from baseline 0.9 to 0.95 factor\n\nTariff Condition: All subsidized industries must pay standard tariffs on production regardless of fueros ports.\n\nRevenue Projections (to masters):\n| Year | Revenue (fl) | Notes |\n|------|-------------|-------|\n| 1436 | 1,500 | Establishment year |\n| 1437 | 2,500 | Full production |\n| 1438 | 3,500 | Apprentices contributing |\n| 1439 | 4,500 | Castilian workers trained |\n| 1440 | 6,000 | Industry established |\n\n4. Arms & Armor Workshop (Bilbao)\n\nStatus: OPERATIONAL (Good Success - Roll 74)\nYear Established: 1434\n\n| Item | Detail |\n|------|--------|\n| Investment (1434) | 8,900 florins one-time |\n| Annual Subsidy | 3,500 florins (retainer 1,500 + guaranteed purchases 2,000) |\n| Production | ~200 soldier's kits/year (1435), scaling to 500-800 by 1439 |\n\nThe Augsburg Consortium:\n- Heinrich Steinmann - Lead armorer, practical military equipment\n- Brother-in-law - Blade-smith\n- Konrad Fels - Mail-maker\n\nPhilosophy: \"Weapons for soldiers, not for display.\" Practical military equipment—hauberks, brigandines, sallets, good steel blades.\n\nLocation: Bilbao (iron access from Basque country)\n\nStrategic Impact:\n- Reduced dependence on Italian arms imports\n- Quality blades and armor for Castilian military\n- Training Castilian apprentices\n- Export potential to Constantinople garrison\n\nProduction Projections:\n| Year | Kits/Year | Notes |\n|------|-----------|-------|\n| 1435 | 200 | Establishment year |\n| 1436 | 300 | Ramping up |\n| 1437 | 400 | Full capacity |\n| 1438 | 500-600 | With trained Castilians |\n| 1439 | 600-800 | Mature operation |\n\n5. Glass Workshop (Burgos)\n\nStatus: OPERATIONAL - SECRET (Excellent Success - Roll 85)\nYear Established: 1434\n\n| Item | Detail |\n|------|--------|\n| Investment (1434) | 7,300 florins one-time |\n| Annual Subsidy | 1,200 florins (retainer 800 + security 400) |\n| Projected Revenue (to master) | 500 florins (1436), growing to 2,500 (1440) |\n\nThe Master:\nAlessandro Barbarigo - Genuine Murano master glassblower (19 years experience)\n\nBackground: Minor branch of noble Barbarigo family. Venice \"disappeared\" his son two months before recruitment—punishment for perceived indiscretion. With no family hostages remaining, he no longer cares if he lives or dies, so long as he wounds Venice.\n\nSpecialties:\n- Cristallo (clear glass) - Venice's signature technique\n- Colored glass\n- Mirrors\n- Vessel work\n\nSECURITY: SECRET OPERATION. Smuggled via Ragusa-Ancona-Genoa-Bilbao route by Isaac de Baeza's network. Workshop location in Burgos kept discreet. Guards posted.\n\nDiplomatic Risk: Venice will protest when they discover his location. Assassination attempts possible but difficult in distant Castile.\n\nTimeline: Estimates 10 years of productive work (eyes beginning to fail). Can train Castilian apprentices in techniques Venice has guarded for centuries.\n\nStrategic Impact:\n- Venetian glassmaking techniques now in Castile\n- Reduced imports from Venice\n- Potential for luxury goods export\n- Training next generation of Castilian glassblowers\n\n6. Leather Industry (Córdoba)\n\nStatus: ONGOING (Existing Industry)\nEnhancement Year: 1434\n\n| Item | Detail |\n|------|--------|\n| Investment (1434) | 3,000 florins one-time |\n| Annual Revenue | ~500 florins additional (growing) |\n\nIndustry: World-famous for cordobanes (fine leather) and guadamecíes (gilded leather)\n\nInitiatives:\n- Sumac cultivation (3-5 years to maturity)\n- Hide production expansion tied to goat herd growth\n- New tannery facility outside Córdoba\n- Guadamecí workshop expansion in Toledo and Seville\n\nStrategic Impact:\n- Building on existing strength\n- Expanding capacity as Granada goat herds grow\n- Export commodity to Italy and France\n\n7. Silk Industry (Granada)\n\nStatus: RECOVERING (Existing Industry)\nEnhancement Year: 1434\n\n| Item | Detail |\n|------|--------|\n| Investment (1434) | 3,250 florins one-time |\n| Annual Subsidy | 400 florins (master supervision) |\n| Pre-Conquest Capacity | 100% |\n| Current Capacity (1435) | ~75-80% |\n\nInitiatives:\n- 50 additional silk looms installed\n- Retraining wool/linen weavers for silk work\n- Dye workshop capacity expanded\n- AmÄn granted to Muslim workers\n\nProblem Addressed: One-third of silk thread was sold raw to Genoese middlemen who captured weaving profits. Now all thread woven into cloth domestically.\n\nStrategic Impact:\n- Value capture from cloth vs. thread (3-5x multiplier)\n- Reduced dependence on Italian middlemen\n- Granada's premier export commodity preserved\n- Muslim craftsmen protected and productive\n\n8. Fishing Fleet (Seville)\n\nStatus: OPERATIONAL (Existing Industry)\nEnhancement Year: 1434\n\n| Item | Detail |\n|------|--------|\n| Investment (1434) | 2,700 florins one-time |\n| Annual Lease Revenue | ~210 florins |\n\nFleet:\n- 8 smaller vessels (40-50 tons) - leased at 15-20 florins/year\n- 2 larger vessels (80-100 tons) - leased at 30-40 florins/year\n\nLease Model: Fishermen lease vessels; ownership transfers after 20 years of lease payments and self-funded maintenance.\n\nStrategic Impact:\n- Expanded Atlantic fishing capacity\n- Exploring waters toward Canary Islands\n- Increased fish supply for domestic consumption\n- Foundation for potential Atlantic expansion\n\nPart III: Problem Industries\n\n9. Ceramics (Málaga/Granada)\n\nStatus: CRITICAL RISK (Poor Success - Roll 25)\nYear Assessed: 1435\n\n| Item | Detail |\n|------|--------|\n| Investment (1435) | 2,500 florins |\n| Current Revenue | ~400-500 florins/year |\n| Knowledge Status | CRITICAL RISK |\n\nThe Situation:\nMálaga was the original home of Hispano-Moresque lusterware—the technique that made Manises famous. The conquest (1433) devastated the industry:\n- 12 master potters before conquest\n- 3 fled to Fez\n- 5 dead\n- 2 unaccounted\n- 2 fled\n- 1 remains: Ibrahim al-Fakhkhar (age 73)\n\nIbrahim's Status:\n- Sole surviving master of golden luster technique\n- Son Ahmad killed defending Puerta de Granada during conquest\n- Grandson Yusef fled to Fez with mother\n- Bitter but skilled—demonstrated exceptional work\n- Refuses to train Christian apprentices\n- Perhaps 5-10 years productive work remaining\n\nPersonal Royal Intervention:\nKing Juan wrote personal letter expressing condolences for Ahmad's death, sharing own grief over Isabel's death, reflecting on legacy and beauty. Commissioned work with complete artistic freedom (50 florins advance, 50 on completion). No Christian symbols requested.\n\nIbrahim's Response (Roll 11): Suspicious distance. \"Tell the King I read his letter. Tell him I will think on it.\" Commission produced 3 pieces of genuine quality. Door not entirely closed.\n\nOptions Remaining:\n1. Continue personal approach\n2. Recover grandson from Fez\n3. Recruit from Manises (Valencia, Aragonese)\n4. Combine approaches\n\nStrategic Concern: When Ibrahim dies, the golden luster secret dies with him unless conditions change.\n\n10. Ceramics Collaboration Model (Seville/Talavera)\n\nStatus: SUCCESS (Solid Success - Roll 41)\nYear Established: 1435\n\n| Item | Detail |\n|------|--------|\n| Investment (1435) | ~195 florins (120 gift set + 75 hospital) |\n| Model | Crown commissions requiring multi-workshop collaboration |\n\nPortuguese Diplomatic Gift Set Commission:\nTerms: 12 decorative plates, 6 drinking vessels, 4 serving dishes, 2 vases. Must combine at least 2 distinct techniques from different workshops.\n\nPartnership Emerged:\n- Francisco de Toledo (34, Talavera) - Clean tin glazes, precise forms\n- Alonso el Moro (61, Seville Morisco) - Intricate cuerda seca, Islamic geometric traditions\n\nResults: Excellent quality. Clean white Talavera glaze + cuerda seca borders (green, blue, ochre). Geometric patterns drawing on Islamic tradition.\n\nFollow-up: Hospital commission awarded (75 florins for drug jars, basins, vessels).\n\nStrategic Impact:\n- Precedent established for multi-workshop collaboration\n- Market incentives drive innovation without forced knowledge sharing\n- Other masters observing with interest\n- Model for future crown commissions\n\nPart IV: Failed Initiatives (1434)\n\n11. Textile Workshop (First Attempt)\n\nStatus: DISCONTINUED (Poor Success - Roll 24)\nYear: 1434\n\n| Item | Detail |\n|------|--------|\n| Investment Lost | 2,600 florins one-time + 400 florins annual |\n| Result | Journeymen, not true masters |\n\nThe Problem: Willem van der Berg, Pieter de Smet, and Joos Claesen presented themselves as Flemish masters but proved to be journeymen of limited skill. Van der Berg never achieved master status in Bruges; de Smet's credentials were purchased.\n\nLesson Learned: Verify credentials rigorously through trusted channels (Medici bank, Burgundian court contacts).\n\nResolution: Replaced by Ghent Consortium (1435, Roll 87).\n\n12. Paper Mills (First Attempt)\n\nStatus: COMPLETE FAILURE (Disaster - Roll 7)\nYear: 1434\n\n| Item | Detail |\n|------|--------|\n| Investment Lost | ~50 florins (hospitality only) |\n| Result | Frauds exposed and expelled |\n\nThe Problem: Guillaume Fournier and Jean de Moulins of Troyes presented themselves as experienced papermakers. Demonstration revealed the truth: unusable paper—uneven, riddled with holes, ink bleeds. They were frauds expelled from their guild for incompetence.\n\nLesson Learned: Require sample production in our presence before any agreement. Verify credentials through multiple sources.\n\nResolution: Replaced by dual recruitment through German and Italian channels (1435, Roll 88).\n\nPart V: Financial Summary\n\nInvestment by Year\n\n1434 Investments (One-Time):\n| Initiative | Amount (fl) |\n|------------|-------------|\n| Arms Workshops (Bilbao) | 8,900 |\n| Textile Workshop (failed, discontinued) | 2,600 |\n| Glass Workshop (Burgos) | 7,300 |\n| Paper Mills (failed) | 50 |\n| Leather Industry (Córdoba) | 3,000 |\n| Silk Industry (Granada) | 3,250 |\n| Fishing Fleet (Seville) | 2,700 |\n| 1434 TOTAL | 27,800 |\n\n1435 Investments (One-Time):\n| Initiative | Amount (fl) |\n|------------|-------------|\n| Paper Mills (Segovia/Toledo) | 10,000 |\n| Textile Workshop (Ghent consortium) | 5,500 |\n| English Ram Breeding (Year 1) | 5,900 |\n| Ceramics Revival (Málaga) | 2,500 |\n| Ceramics Commissions | ~195 |\n| 1435 TOTAL | ~24,100 |\n\nAnnual Recurring Costs (1435)\n\n| Initiative | Annual Cost (fl) | Notes |\n|------------|-----------------|-------|\n| Arms Workshops | 3,500 | Retainer + purchases |\n| Glass Workshop | 1,200 | Retainer + security |\n| Textile Workshop | 500 | Guaranteed purchases |\n| Paper Mills | ~1,500 | Operating costs |\n| Silk Industry | 400 | Master supervision |\n| Leather Industry | — | Infrastructure only |\n| Fishing Fleet | — | Self-sustaining (lease revenue) |\n| TOTAL ANNUAL | ~7,100 |\n\nNote: Textile Workshop (failed) had 400 fl/year recurring cost that is now discontinued.\n\nProjected Costs (1436-1440)\n\n| Year | One-Time | Annual | Notes |\n|------|----------|--------|-------|\n| 1436 | ~6,000 | ~7,100 | Ram breeding Year 2 |\n| 1437 | ~6,000 | ~7,100 | Ram breeding Year 3 |\n| 1438 | ~1,000 | ~7,100 | Maintenance only |\n| 1439 | ~1,000 | ~6,600 | Textile purchases end |\n| 1440 | ~1,000 | ~6,600 | Mature operations |\n\nRevenue Summary (1435)\n\nCrown-Owned Industries:\n| Initiative | Gross Revenue | Net Revenue | Notes |\n|------------|--------------|-------------|-------|\n| Paper Mills | 4,000 | ~2,500 | After operating costs |\n| Wool Breeding | 0 | 0 | Long-term investment |\n| Crown Total | 4,000 | ~2,500 |\n\nCrown Revenue from Private Industries:\n| Source | Amount | Notes |\n|--------|--------|-------|\n| Alcabala (5%) on new production | ~300-400 | Arms, glass, textiles |\n| Customs on reduced imports | Variable | Savings rather than revenue |\n| Fishing fleet leases | 210 | Direct payment |\n| Private Industry Crown Revenue | ~600 |\n\nTotal Crown Revenue from Economic Development (1435): ~3,100 florins\nNet Position (Revenue - Costs): ~3,100 - 7,100 = -4,000 florins\n\nThe economic development program operates at a deficit through the initial years, with break-even expected around 1439-1440 as industries mature.\n\nPart VI: Strategic Assessment\n\nImport Substitution Achieved\n\n| Product | Pre-1434 Status | 1435 Status |\n|---------|-----------------|-------------|\n| Paper | 100% imported | ~60% domestic |\n| Cloth (quality) | 100% imported | Beginning domestic production |\n| Glass (quality) | 100% imported | Beginning domestic production |\n| Arms & Armor | ~80% imported | ~50% domestic, improving |\n| Silk cloth | ~30% raw exported | All woven domestically |\n\nKnowledge Transfer\n\n| Industry | Foreign Masters | Castilian Apprentices | Years to Self-Sufficiency |\n|----------|-----------------|----------------------|---------------------------|\n| Paper | 2 (German, Italian) | 10 | 4-5 |\n| Textiles | 3 (Flemish) | 12+ planned | 5-7 |\n| Glass | 1 (Venetian) | 4+ planned | 8-10 |\n| Arms | 3 (German) | 8+ | 5-7 |\n| Ceramics | 1 (surviving local) | 0 (refused) | CRITICAL |\n\nKey Lessons Learned\n\n1. Verification is essential: Sample production required before commitment (learned from paper fraud)\n2. True masters are rare: Poor-quality recruits waste resources (learned from textile failure)\n3. Channels matter: Medici bank and German contacts more reliable than general recruitment\n4. Collaboration can work: Market incentives for multi-workshop cooperation (ceramics)\n5. Dual recruitment adds resilience: Two paper mills with different specialties provide redundancy\n6. Tariff standardization: All subsidized industries pay standard tariffs regardless of fueros\n\nCritical Risks\n\n1. Ceramics Knowledge: Ibrahim al-Fakhkhar (73) is sole keeper of golden luster technique. When he dies, it may die with him.\n2. Venetian Retaliation: Venice will eventually discover Barbarigo's location. Diplomatic incident and possible assassination attempts.\n3. Flemish Guild Anger: Ghent consortium's departure may cause trade friction with Burgundy.\n4. English Discovery: Ram smuggling could be exposed, causing diplomatic problems.\n\nPart VII: Ownership Structure Summary\n\nCrown-Owned\n- Paper mills (Segovia, Toledo)\n- Royal breeding flocks (wool improvement)\n\nCrown-Subsidized, Privately Operated\n- Textile workshop (Ghent consortium)\n- Arms workshop (Steinmann consortium)\n- Glass workshop (Barbarigo)\n- Ceramics commissions (Francisco/Alonso collaboration)\n\nTraditional Private/Guild (Enhanced)\n- Leather industry (Córdoba guilds)\n- Silk industry (Granada guilds + Muslim craftsmen)\n- Fishing (Seville cofradía)\n- Ceramics (Talavera/Seville guilds)\n\nAt Risk\n- Málaga ceramics (Ibrahim alone, no succession)\n\nDocument maintained for campaign reference.

      "full_text": "FUEROS DE ARAGÓN\nAs Codified Under Jaime I and Confirmed by Successive Kings\nPresented to Don Juan, Claimant to the Crown of Aragon, September 1437\n\nPREAMBLE\n\nIn Nomine Domini. Amen.\n\nThese are the Fueros, Liberties, Customs, and Privileges of the Kingdom of Aragon, gathered and set down in the time of the most excellent King Don Jaime, called the Conqueror, confirmed and amended by his successors, and held inviolate by all who would wear the crown of this ancient realm.\n\nLet it be known to all who read these words that the Kingdom of Aragon was not made by kings alone, but by the union of king and people against the enemies of Christ. In the mountains of Sobrarbe, when the Moors held all the land, free men chose a king from among themselves to lead them in war—and in choosing, they made a compact that has endured unto this day.\n\nThe king rules not by right of blood alone, nor by grace of God alone, but by the consent of the realm and the sacred oath that binds him to his people as they are bound to him.\n\nNos qui sumus æquales tibi. We who are as good as you.\n\nThis is the foundation. Let no man forget it.\n\nBOOK I: OF THE KING AND HIS OATH\n\nTitle I: Of the Nature of Aragonese Kingship\n\nArticle 1. The King of Aragon holds his crown by inheritance according to the laws of succession, by the grace of Almighty God, and by the acceptance of the Cortes of the realm. No man may be crowned King of Aragon who has not been acknowledged by the Cortes and sworn the coronation oath in its ancient form.\n\nArticle 2. The King is the first among the Aragonese, but not their master. He is bound by the same laws that bind his subjects, save only those matters wherein the dignity of the crown requires special provision.\n\nArticle 3. The King may not be judged by any court within the realm, for there is no authority above him save God alone. Yet if the King violates the fueros, the people are released from their obedience, for an oath broken by one party binds not the other.\n\nTitle II: Of the Coronation Oath\n\nArticle 4. Before the crown shall touch his brow, the claimant must swear the following oath before the Cortes, upon the Holy Gospels and in the presence of the Justicia:\n\n\"We, Don [Name], by the grace of God King of Aragon, do swear upon these Holy Gospels and by the Precious Blood of Our Lord Jesus Christ, that we shall maintain, preserve, and defend the fueros, liberties, privileges, and customs of this Kingdom of Aragon, and of all its inhabitants, as they have been maintained by our predecessors; that we shall do justice to all men according to the laws of this realm; that we shall take no new tax nor levy without the consent of the Cortes; and that we shall in all things govern according to the ancient liberties of our people. And if we fail in this oath, may God judge us, and may our subjects be released from their allegiance. So help us God and these Holy Gospels.\"\n\nArticle 5. The Cortes shall respond to the oath with these words:\n\n\"We, who are as good as you, and who together are greater than you, accept you as our King and sovereign lord, provided that you keep our fueros and liberties; and if not, not.\"\n\nArticle 6. The oath once sworn may not be forsworn. A king who violates his coronation oath commits perjury before God and treason against the realm.\n\nTitle III: Of the Succession\n\nArticle 7. The crown of Aragon descends by primogeniture to the eldest legitimate son of the king, and failing sons, to daughters, and failing direct issue, to the nearest heir of the blood according to the laws of consanguinity.\n\nArticle 8. No bastard may inherit the crown, though he may be legitimated for other purposes by royal act.\n\nArticle 9. If the succession is disputed, the Cortes shall determine the rightful heir according to law, treaty, and the good of the realm.\n\nBOOK II: OF THE JUSTICIA OF ARAGON\n\nTitle I: Of the Office and Its Powers\n\nArticle 10. There shall be in the Kingdom of Aragon an office called the Justicia, which shall stand between the King and the people as guardian of the fueros and judge of disputes between them.\n\nArticle 11. The Justicia shall be a knight of Aragon, learned in the laws, of good fame and unblemished honor. He shall hold office for life and may not be removed by the King for any cause, save only conviction of treason or heresy by proper ecclesiastical tribunal.\n\nArticle 12. The Justicia shall have power to interpret the fueros in all cases of doubt, and his interpretation shall be binding upon all parties, including the crown.\n\nArticle 13. If the King issues any decree, order, or command that violates the fueros, the Justicia may declare it void. Such declaration shall be made publicly, with reasons stated, and the decree so voided shall have no force in law.\n\nArticle 14. The Justicia shall maintain the authoritative text of these fueros and all amendments thereto. Any man may consult this text, and the Justicia's scribes shall provide certified copies for a reasonable fee.\n\nArticle 15. The Justicia shall have a court, staffed by lieutenants learned in the law, to hear all matters touching the fueros and the liberties of the realm.\n\nTitle II: Of the Manifestación\n\nArticle 16. Any freeman of Aragon who is imprisoned or detained by royal authority may invoke the Manifestación, appealing to the Justicia for protection.\n\nArticle 17. Upon such invocation, the Justicia shall send officers to remove the prisoner from royal custody and hold him in the Justicia's own prison until the matter is properly adjudicated.\n\nArticle 18. No royal officer may refuse to surrender a prisoner who has invoked the Manifestación. Any officer who refuses may be declared a breaker of the fueros and punished accordingly.\n\nArticle 19. The prisoner held under Manifestación may not be tortured, mutilated, or executed until the Justicia's court has determined whether proper procedures were followed in his arrest and detention. If the procedures were defective, the prisoner shall be released.\n\nArticle 20. The Manifestación protects against improper process, not against just punishment. If the Justicia's court finds that the arrest was lawful and the procedures correct, the prisoner shall be returned to royal custody for trial.\n\nTitle III: Of the Firma de Derecho\n\nArticle 21. Any man who believes he will be unjustly prosecuted or deprived of his property may seek the Firma de Derecho—the Justicia's preemptive protection.\n\nArticle 22. Upon granting the Firma, the Justicia issues a writ forbidding any court or officer from proceeding against the petitioner until the Justicia's court has examined the matter and determined whether the intended action is lawful.\n\nArticle 23. The Firma de Derecho may not be invoked to escape punishment for crimes already committed and proven, but only to prevent unjust prosecution or arbitrary seizure.\n\nBOOK III: OF THE RIGHTS OF THE NOBILITY\n\nTitle I: Of Noble Privileges\n\nArticle 24. The nobles of Aragon—ricos hombres, knights, infanzones, and hidalgos—shall enjoy the following privileges, which no king may abridge:\n\nArticle 25. No noble may be imprisoned without first being tried and convicted by a court of his peers. The king may not order the arrest of a noble on suspicion alone, but must present charges before a proper tribunal.\n\nArticle 26. No noble may be subjected to torture under any circumstances whatsoever. Confession extracted by torture shall have no validity in any court.\n\nArticle 27. No noble may have his lands or goods confiscated save by judgment of his peers for proven crime. The king may not seize noble property by decree.\n\nArticle 28. Nobles may wage private war against one another according to the ancient custom, provided they first issue formal defiance (desafiamiento) and observe the established rules of feud. Such private war is not treason against the crown.\n\nArticle 29. Nobles may fortify their castles and maintain armed retainers without royal permission, save that they may not make war against the king or harbor the king's enemies.\n\nArticle 30. The noble who is wronged by the king may formally renounce his allegiance (desnaturamiento) and depart the realm with his goods, and this shall not be deemed treason, provided he does not take up arms against Aragon in service of a foreign power.\n\nTitle II: Of the Assembly of Nobles\n\nArticle 31. The nobles of Aragon shall have the right to assemble and deliberate upon matters touching their interests, and to present their grievances to the king through their chosen representatives in the Cortes.\n\nArticle 32. No law touching the rights of the nobility may be enacted without the consent of the noble estate in the Cortes.\n\nBOOK IV: OF THE RIGHTS OF CITIES AND TOWNS\n\nTitle I: Of Municipal Liberties\n\nArticle 33. The cities and towns of Aragon that hold royal charters shall govern themselves according to those charters, and the king may not abridge their chartered liberties.\n\nArticle 34. Chartered cities may elect their own councils, judges, and officers according to their customs. The king may not appoint city officials nor override municipal elections.\n\nArticle 35. Chartered cities may administer justice in minor cases according to their own customs, subject to appeal to the Justicia in matters touching the fueros.\n\nArticle 36. Chartered cities may levy local taxes for municipal purposes without royal permission, subject to their own council's approval.\n\nArticle 37. The king may not quarter troops upon a chartered city without the council's consent, save in time of war and necessity, and then only with just compensation.\n\nTitle II: Of Markets and Commerce\n\nArticle 38. The cities and towns may hold markets and fairs according to their charters, and the king may not impose new tolls or customs duties upon internal trade save with the consent of the Cortes.\n\nArticle 39. Foreign merchants may trade in Aragon according to the treaties made with their sovereigns and the customs of each city, provided they pay the established duties and observe the laws of the realm.\n\nBOOK V: OF THE RIGHTS OF THE COMMONS\n\nTitle I: Of Personal Liberty\n\nArticle 40. The peasants and common folk of Aragon shall enjoy the following liberties, in greater measure than those of other realms:\n\nArticle 41. In the greater part of Aragon, the peasant who works the land may depart from his lord's estate if he is ill-treated, provided he surrenders his tenancy and pays any debts justly owed. No lord may bind a peasant to the soil against his will by force alone.\n\nArticle 42. Exception: In certain territories, particularly in Catalonia, the remença custom prevails, wherein peasants are bound to the land by ancient usage. The fueros of Aragon do not override the particular customs of Catalonia in this matter.\n\nArticle 43. No freeman of Aragon may be enslaved, save that Moors and infidels taken in just war may be held as captives according to the laws of Christendom.\n\nArticle 44. Any serf or bondsman who dwells in a chartered city for a year and a day without his lord reclaiming him shall be deemed free.\n\nTitle II: Of Justice for Commons\n\nArticle 45. The common folk shall have access to justice in the Justicia's courts as well as in royal and municipal courts. The Manifestación and Firma de Derecho are available to all freemen, not only to nobles.\n\nArticle 46. No man may be condemned without trial, nor punished beyond what the law provides for his offense.\n\nBOOK VI: OF THE CORTES\n\nTitle I: Of Its Composition\n\nArticle 47. The Cortes of Aragon is the assembly of the realm, wherein all estates are represented: the clergy (brazo eclesiástico), the high nobility (brazo de ricos hombres), the lesser nobility (brazo de caballeros e infanzones), and the cities (brazo de universidades).\n\nArticle 48. The King may summon the Cortes at his pleasure, but must summon it at least once every two years, and whenever great matters touching the realm require deliberation.\n\nArticle 49. The Cortes shall meet in Zaragoza unless necessity requires another location, and proper notice must be given to all who have the right to attend.\n\nTitle II: Of Its Powers\n\nArticle 50. No new tax, levy, subsidy, or imposition may be laid upon the people of Aragon without the consent of the Cortes. The King may request; only the Cortes may grant.\n\nArticle 51. The consent of all four estates is required for any grant of taxation. If any single estate refuses, the tax may not be levied.\n\nArticle 52. No new law may be enacted nor existing law amended without the consent of the Cortes. The King proposes; the Cortes disposes.\n\nArticle 53. The Cortes may present grievances (greuges) to the King, and the King must hear them and provide remedy before the Cortes votes upon his requests.\n\nArticle 54. The Cortes may petition the King for redress of wrongs, and the King should give just answer, though he is not bound to grant every petition.\n\nTitle III: Of Procedure\n\nArticle 55. Each estate shall deliberate separately upon matters before the Cortes, and each shall have one vote. Unanimity among the estates is required for taxation and legislation.\n\nArticle 56. The proceedings of the Cortes shall be recorded by notaries and preserved in the archives of the realm.\n\nBOOK VII: OF THE SEPARATE REALMS\n\nTitle I: Of the Distinction of Kingdoms\n\nArticle 57. The Crown of Aragon encompasses divers realms: the Kingdom of Aragon, the Principality of Catalonia, and the Kingdom of Valencia, together with such other territories as may be united to the crown. Each realm retains its own laws, customs, fueros, and liberties.\n\nArticle 58. The King of Aragon is also Count of Barcelona and King of Valencia. He owes separate oaths to each realm and must observe the particular laws of each.\n\nArticle 59. A law enacted by the Cortes of Aragon has no force in Catalonia unless the Corts of Catalonia separately approves it, and likewise for Valencia and any other realm.\n\nArticle 60. The King may not transfer revenues from one realm to another without the consent of the realm from which the revenues come.\n\nArticle 61. Offices in each realm shall be held by natives of that realm. A Castilian may not hold office in Aragon, nor an Aragonese in Catalonia, save by special dispensation of the appropriate Cortes.\n\nTitle II: Of Union Under One Crown\n\nArticle 62. Though the realms are separate in law, they are united in the person of the King, and shall render mutual aid in time of war and necessity.\n\nArticle 63. The King may summon a General Cortes of all realms for matters touching the common defense, but each realm's representatives retain their separate voting and their separate fueros.\n\nBOOK VIII: OF AMENDMENTS AND INTERPRETATION\n\nArticle 64. These fueros may be amended only by consent of the King and all four estates of the Cortes, with the Justicia certifying that the amendment violates no fundamental liberty of the realm.\n\nArticle 65. In all cases of doubt, the fueros shall be interpreted in favor of liberty and against the expansion of royal power, for the fueros were made to protect the people from tyranny, not to arm the tyrant against the people.\n\nArticle 66. These fueros bind the King and all his successors forever. No King may claim ignorance of them, for they are published and known. No King may claim exception from them, for the oath binds without reservation.\n\nQuod principi placuit, legis habet vigorem—what pleases the prince has the force of law—is the maxim of tyrants. In Aragon, the maxim is otherwise:\n\nQuod lex statuit, regi placere debet. What the law establishes, the king must accept.\n\nCLOSING\n\nDatum et actum in the City of Zaragoza, in the presence of the Cortes, in the year of Our Lord one thousand four hundred and thirty-seven, for the instruction of Don Juan, by the grace of God King of Castile and León, claimant to the Crown of Aragon.\n\nMay God preserve the fueros.\nMay God preserve the realm.\nMay God preserve the king who keeps his oath.\n\nFinis.\n\n[Certified true copy by the Office of the Justicia of Aragon]\n\n[Seal]",

      "full_text": "FUEROS DE ARAGÓN\nAdditiones Novae — New Books Added by the Cortes of Zaragoza\nNovember 1437\n\nIn Nomine Domini. Amen.\n\nThese additions to the ancient Fueros of Aragon are enacted by the consent of His Majesty Don Juan, King of Aragon, Count of Barcelona, King of Valencia, and the four estates of the realm assembled in Cortes at Zaragoza, in the year of Our Lord one thousand four hundred and thirty-seven.\n\nLet it be known that these provisions do not abridge, diminish, or alter the ancient liberties of the realm, but rather strengthen and clarify them for the benefit of all who dwell under the protection of Aragonese law.\n\nBOOK IX: OF THE CENTRAL REGISTRY OF PRIVILEGES\nDe Registro Privilegiorum\n\nPREAMBLE\n\nWhereas the privileges, liberties, fueros, and grants of the Kingdom of Aragon have accumulated over centuries in divers chests, archives, monasteries, and strongboxes throughout the realm;\n\nWhereas this dispersal has led to confusion, contradiction, litigation, and the diminishment of rights that should be protected;\n\nWhereas no king can swear to uphold that which he does not know, nor defend that which lies hidden from his sight;\n\nWhereas the noble houses of Aragon have expressed their desire for clarity, certainty, and the permanent protection of their ancient rights;\n\nTherefore, by the consent of all estates, we establish the Central Registry of Privileges, to be maintained in perpetuity for the protection of Aragonese liberties.\n\nTitle I: Establishment of the Registry\n\nArticle 1. There shall be established in the Kingdom of Aragon a Central Registry of Privileges (Registrum Centrale Privilegiorum), wherein all fueros, privileges, liberties, grants, immunities, and customary rights may be recorded and preserved.\n\nArticle 2. The Registry shall be maintained by the Office of the Justicia of Aragon, in secure archives within the city of Zaragoza, protected from fire, flood, theft, and all manner of destruction.\n\nArticle 3. The Justicia shall appoint such clerks, scribes, notaries, and archivists as are necessary to maintain the Registry, all of whom shall be natives of the realms of the Crown of Aragon and shall swear oaths of faithful service.\n\nArticle 4. The Registry shall be accessible to all who have legitimate interest in consulting it. Any freeman of Aragon may request certified copies of registered privileges upon payment of reasonable fees established by the Justicia's office.\n\nTitle II: The Effect of Registration\n\nArticle 5. A privilege once registered in the Central Registry becomes unassailable (inexpugnabile). No king, no court, no authority temporal or spiritual may challenge, abridge, diminish, or revoke a registered privilege, save only by the free consent of the holder thereof.\n\nArticle 6. Registration transforms a privilege from a claim that may be disputed into a right that cannot be disputed. The act of registration is the act of permanent confirmation.\n\nArticle 7. This protection extends to all successors of the registering party. A privilege registered by a father protects his sons, his grandsons, and all who inherit his rights in perpetuity.\n\nArticle 8. No future king of Aragon may alter, suspend, or circumvent the protections of this Title. Any decree, order, or act purporting to challenge a registered privilege is void ab initio and shall be declared so by the Justicia.\n\nTitle III: The Transition Period\n\nArticle 9. For a period of twenty-five years from the promulgation of this Book—that is, until the year of Our Lord one thousand four hundred and sixty-two—all privileges not yet registered shall retain their current validity and force.\n\nArticle 10. During the transition period, no house shall be penalized, disadvantaged, or prejudiced for declining to register its privileges, for delay in registration, or for difficulty in locating ancient documents.\n\nArticle 11. Houses are encouraged but not compelled to register during the transition period. Registration is voluntary, and the benefits of registration are offered as inducement, not the penalties of non-registration as coercion.\n\nArticle 12. After the expiration of the transition period, the following provisions shall apply:\n\n(a) Registered privileges take precedence over unregistered privileges in any dispute or conflict between them;\n\n(b) Unregistered privileges remain valid but are subject to the same uncertainties, disputes, and litigation that prevail under the current system;\n\n(c) No unregistered privilege shall be deemed void solely by reason of non-registration, but neither shall it enjoy the unassailable protection afforded to registered privileges.\n\nTitle IV: Registration of Verbal and Customary Privileges\n\nArticle 13. Many privileges in the Kingdom of Aragon exist not in written form but in custom, tradition, and the memory of generations. Such privileges are no less valid for their lack of parchment.\n\nArticle 14. A house wishing to register a verbal or customary privilege may petition the Justicia for recognition. The petition shall include:\n\n(a) A description of the privilege claimed;\n\n(b) Evidence of its exercise over time, including the testimony of witnesses, the acknowledgment of neighbors, or other proof of long usage;\n\n(c) Any documents, however informal, that reference the privilege.\n\nArticle 15. The Justicia's office shall examine such petitions and, if satisfied that the privilege has been genuinely exercised by custom, shall reduce it to writing and enter it in the Registry.\n\nArticle 16. A customary privilege once registered enjoys the same unassailable protection as a privilege derived from ancient charter. The act of registration makes real in law what was real in practice.\n\nArticle 17. The Justicia may require additional evidence, conduct inquiries, or hear testimony before approving the registration of customary privileges. This process shall be conducted fairly, without favor to great houses over lesser ones.\n\nTitle V: Later-Discovered Privileges\n\nArticle 18. It may occur that a privilege, long thought lost, is discovered after another conflicting privilege has been registered. In such cases, the following rules apply:\n\nArticle 19. A later-discovered privilege may still be registered in the Central Registry, provided it meets the requirements for registration and is not fraudulent.\n\nArticle 20. However, when a later-discovered privilege conflicts with an earlier-registered privilege, the earlier-registered privilege takes precedence. Priority of registration establishes priority of right in cases of conflict.\n\nArticle 21. This rule exists to prevent fraud and to protect those who registered in good faith. A house that discovers an ancient document purporting to grant rights already confirmed to another house cannot use that discovery to overturn settled expectations.\n\nArticle 22. In cases where the conflict is partial rather than total, the Justicia may seek to harmonize the privileges, preserving what can be preserved for both parties. Complete displacement of a registered privilege by a later discovery is not permitted.\n\nTitle VI: The Noble Oversight Committee\n\nArticle 23. To ensure the fair and impartial administration of the Registry, there shall be established a Committee of Oversight (Comitatus Custodiae), composed of three nobles of the realm.\n\nArticle 24. The members of the Committee shall be appointed by the Cortes, one from each of the noble estates: one from the ricos hombres, one from the caballeros, and one from the infanzones.\n\nArticle 25. Committee members shall serve terms of five years, rotating such that the composition changes gradually rather than all at once. No member may serve consecutive terms.\n\nArticle 26. The Committee shall have the following powers and duties:\n\n(a) To review any decision of the Justicia's office regarding the registration or rejection of privileges;\n\n(b) To hear appeals from houses dissatisfied with the handling of their registration;\n\n(c) To investigate complaints of unfair treatment, favoritism, or corruption in the Registry's administration;\n\n(d) To report annually to the Cortes on the state of the Registry.\n\nArticle 27. No privilege may be rejected for registration without the Committee's review and concurrence. The Justicia may approve registrations alone, but rejections require Committee confirmation.\n\nArticle 28. The Crown shall have no representative on the Committee. This is an Aragonese institution, maintained by Aragonese officers, overseen by Aragonese nobles, protecting Aragonese rights. Royal interference in the Committee's work is forbidden.\n\nTitle VII: The Independence of the Justicia\n\nArticle 29. The Office of the Justicia of Aragon, as guardian of the Registry and of the fueros themselves, must remain independent of royal influence.\n\nArticle 30. The King may not appoint, remove, direct, or discipline the Justicia or any officer of the Justicia's court in matters touching the Registry or the interpretation of the fueros.\n\nArticle 31. Any reforms to the Office of the Justicia—whether to strengthen its independence, expand its staff, improve its procedures, or otherwise alter its functioning—must originate from the noble estate and be approved by the Cortes. The Crown may not initiate such reforms.\n\nArticle 32. This provision exists because the King swears to uphold the fueros; he cannot also control the office that interprets and protects them. The guardian must be independent of the guarded.\n\nArticle 33. The King acknowledges that he cannot defend fueros he does not know exist. The Registry serves the Crown by making known what must be defended. But knowledge does not confer control; the King learns what he must uphold, not what he may challenge.\n\nCLOSING OF BOOK IX\n\nLet this Registry stand as a monument to Aragonese liberty. Let it protect the rights of the great and the small, the ancient houses and the new. Let it bring clarity where there was confusion, certainty where there was doubt, and peace where there was conflict.\n\nAnd let any king who violates these provisions know that he breaks not merely a law, but a sacred compact with his people—and that an oath broken by one party binds not the other.\n\nBOOK X: OF THE SACRED TITHE AND THE DEFENSE OF CHRISTENDOM\nDe Decimis Sacris et Defensione Christianitatis\n\nPREAMBLE\n\nWhereas the Holy Father Pope Innocent III granted to the kings of Spain the tercias reales—the royal third of the tithe—for the purpose of funding the sacred war against the enemies of Christ;\n\nWhereas the Reconquista in Iberia is now complete, praised be God, but the enemies of Christ press ever closer to the heart of Christendom in the East;\n\nWhereas Constantinople, the ancient seat of the Roman Empire and the guardian of Eastern Christianity, stands in mortal peril from the Ottoman Turk;\n\nWhereas the clergy of Aragon, assembled in this Cortes, have acknowledged that the defense of Christendom is as sacred a cause today as it was when the tercias were first granted;\n\nWhereas clarity is needed regarding the rights and obligations of Crown and Church in this matter;\n\nTherefore, by the consent of the ecclesiastical estate and the Crown, we establish the following provisions.\n\nTitle I: The Right to the Tercias\n\nArticle 1. The Crown of Aragon affirms its right to the tercias reales—the royal third of the tithe—as granted by apostolic authority for the defense of the faith.\n\nArticle 2. This right shall be confirmed by petition to the Holy See, requesting clarification that the original grant remains in force for the defense of Christendom against the Ottoman threat, as it was in force for the defense against the Moorish threat.\n\nArticle 3. The Archbishop of Zaragoza, speaking for the clergy of Aragon, shall co-sign this petition, affirming the Church's support for the clarification.\n\nArticle 4. Until Rome has ruled, the existing arrangements regarding the tercias shall continue without alteration. This Book establishes principles for the future, not demands for the present.\n\nTitle II: Dedication to the Crusade\n\nArticle 5. The tercias collected under the authority of this Book shall be dedicated exclusively to the defense of Christendom against its enemies. This is a sacred trust, not a general revenue.\n\nArticle 6. A separate accounting shall be maintained for all tercias revenues, distinct from the ordinary treasury of the Crown. This accounting shall be called the Arca Sacra Cruciatae—the Sacred Treasury of the Crusade.\n\nArticle 7. Expenditures from the Sacred Treasury shall be limited to:\n\n(a) The maintenance of armies and fleets engaged in the defense of Christian lands against infidel assault;\n\n(b) The fortification of cities, harbors, and strongpoints essential to that defense;\n\n(c) The support of Christian populations living under threat of conquest;\n\n(d) The ransom of Christian captives held by infidel powers;\n\n(e) Such other purposes as directly serve the defense of Christendom, as certified by the Archbishop of Zaragoza or his delegate.\n\nArticle 8. The tercias may not be used for wars between Christian princes, for the personal enrichment of the Crown, for the payment of ordinary government expenses, or for any purpose unconnected with the sacred cause for which they were granted.\n\nTitle III: Collection and Oversight\n\nArticle 9. The collection of tithes shall remain in the hands of Church officials, as is proper for sacred revenues. The Crown shall not replace ecclesiastical collectors with royal officers.\n\nArticle 10. However, the Crown may appoint auditors to work alongside Church collectors, verifying that the tercias are honestly calculated, properly separated, and faithfully remitted to the Sacred Treasury.\n\nArticle 11. These auditors shall be men of good character, preferably with ecclesiastical training or connections, who understand both the sacred nature of the tithe and the practical necessities of accurate accounting.\n\nArticle 12. The auditors shall have no authority to collect, only to observe and verify. They shall report discrepancies to both the Crown and the relevant bishop, who shall work together to resolve any irregularities.\n\nArticle 13. The Archbishop of Zaragoza, or a delegate appointed by him, shall have the right to inspect the Sacred Treasury's accounts at any time, ensuring that the revenues are spent only for their dedicated purpose.\n\nTitle IV: The Crown's Obligations\n\nArticle 14. In exchange for the Church's support regarding the tercias, the Crown acknowledges and affirms the following obligations:\n\nArticle 15. The Crown shall build and maintain churches in the lands recovered from infidel occupation in the East, providing for the spiritual needs of Christian settlers and the conversion of willing souls.\n\nArticle 16. The Crown shall build and maintain churches in the new lands discovered along the African coast and beyond, bringing the light of Christ to peoples who have never known His name.\n\nArticle 17. The Crown shall support the missionary endeavors of the religious orders, particularly those engaged in preaching to infidels and the ransoming of captives.\n\nArticle 18. The Crown shall defend the liberties of the Church in all its dominions, neither encroaching upon ecclesiastical jurisdiction nor permitting others to do so.\n\nArticle 19. These obligations are binding upon the King and all his successors. They are the price of the Church's support, and they shall be honored in perpetuity.\n\nCLOSING OF BOOK X\n\nLet the wealth of the faithful serve the defense of the faith. Let the tithe given to God return to God's purpose—the protection of His people against those who would destroy them. Let Crown and Church stand together in this sacred cause, each fulfilling its proper role, neither encroaching upon the other.\n\nAnd let any king who diverts these sacred revenues to profane purposes know that he sins not only against the law, but against God Himself—and that such sin brings consequences both temporal and eternal.\n\nBOOK XI: OF VOLUNTARY MUSTER FOR THE HOLY WAR\nDe Convocatione Voluntaria pro Bello Sacro\n\nPREAMBLE\n\nWhereas the Ottoman Turk threatens the destruction of Christian civilization in the East;\n\nWhereas the Emperor of the Romans has called upon all Christian princes for aid in the defense of Constantinople and the restoration of lands stolen by the infidel;\n\nWhereas His Majesty Don Juan, King of Aragon, holds also the title of Defensor Romaniae, charged by God and the Emperor with the coordination of the Western response to this threat;\n\nWhereas the nobility of Aragon has expressed interest in participating in this sacred enterprise, but according to their ancient liberties rather than by royal compulsion;\n\nTherefore, by the consent of all estates, we establish the following provisions for voluntary muster in the defense of Christendom.\n\nTitle I: The Principle of Voluntary Service\n\nArticle 1. No noble of Aragon shall be compelled to serve in the war against the Ottoman. The fueros protect the liberty of the nobility, and that liberty includes the freedom to choose one's wars.\n\nArticle 2. However, the Crown offers to all nobles of Aragon the opportunity to serve—and with that service, the opportunity to earn glory, titles, and estates in the lands to be recovered from infidel occupation.\n\nArticle 3. This is not a demand disguised as an offer. Nobles who decline to participate shall suffer no penalty, no disfavor, no diminishment of their rights or standing. They simply shall not share in the rewards reserved for those who risk blood and treasure in the sacred cause.\n\nArticle 4. The choice belongs to each noble house. Some will choose glory; some will choose safety. Both choices are lawful under the fueros.\n\nTitle II: The Mustering System\n\nArticle 5. For the purpose of organizing Aragonese participation in the Eastern war, mustering points shall be established within the realms of the Crown of Aragon.\n\nArticle 6. Each mustering point shall be overseen by a marshal (marescallus), who shall be a native of the realm in which the mustering point is located. Castilian marshals shall not command Aragonese musters; the fueros require that offices be held by natives of the realm.\n\nArticle 7. The marshals shall be appointed by the Crown from among nobles who have demonstrated military competence and administrative capability. The Cortes may advise on appointments, though final authority rests with the Crown.\n\nArticle 8. At each muster, the following shall be recorded:\n\n(a) The name of each noble house contributing forces;\n\n(b) The number and type of troops contributed;\n\n(c) The equipment and readiness of those troops;\n\n(d) Whether the noble claimant serves personally or sends forces under a deputy.\n\nArticle 9. These records shall be maintained with the same care as the Registry of Privileges, for they determine the claims of each house to the rewards of service.\n\nTitle III: Unified Command\n\nArticle 10. Those who present forces at muster agree to serve under unified command for the duration of the campaign. This is the price of participation.\n\nArticle 11. The purpose of unified command is not to diminish noble dignity, but to ensure victory. An army with a dozen independent captains, each pursuing his own glory, is not an army—it is a mob. The Ottoman has destroyed such forces before. He shall not be given the opportunity to do so again.\n\nArticle 12. Unified command means:\n\n(a) Obedience to the orders of designated commanders in matters of strategy and tactics;\n\n(b) Coordination with other contingents, whether Aragonese, Castilian, or from other Christian realms;\n\n(c) Discipline in camp, on march, and in battle;\n\n(d) Acceptance that individual glory is subordinate to collective victory.\n\nArticle 13. Nobles who cannot accept these conditions should not muster. There is no shame in remaining home; there is great shame in joining an army and then undermining its cohesion through disobedience or pride.\n\nTitle IV: The Constitution of Contributions and Claims\n\nArticle 14. The rewards for service shall be calculated according to the Constitutio de Contributionibus et Claimis, proclaimed at Constantinople in the year 1434 by His Majesty Don Juan and the Emperor John VIII Palaiologos.\n\nArticle 15. The key provisions of that Constitution, applicable to Aragonese participants, are as follows:\n\nArticle 16. Contribution Strength is calculated thus:\n\nContribution Strength = (Weighted Troop Value × Claim Multiplier) + Personal Service Bonus\n\nArticle 17. Troop Values:\n\n| Troop Type | Minimum Equipment | Value |\n|------------|-------------------|-------|\n| Infantry | Spear, shield, helmet, padded jack or better | ×1 |\n| Light Cavalry | Horse, lance or javelin, sword, helmet, leather or mail | ×3 |\n| Heavy Cavalry / Knight | Warhorse, lance, sword, full mail or plate, shield | ×5 |\n\nArticle 18. Naval Values:\n\n| Vessel Type | Requirements | Value |\n|-------------|--------------|-------|\n| War Galley | Fully crewed, armed marines, combat ready | 100 |\n| Transport Galley | Crew present, fewer than 20 marines | 40 |\n| Armed Merchant | Armed crew, defensible | 30 |\n| Small Coastal Vessel | Armed, seaworthy | 10 |\n\nArticle 19. Claim Multiplier:\n\n| Claim Type | Multiplier |\n|------------|------------|\n| Ancient/legitimate claim (predating 1204 or granted by legitimate Roman Emperor) | ×3 |\n| No ancient claim, or claim derived from Latin Empire (1204-1261) | ×1 |\n\nArticle 20. Personal Service Bonus:\n\n| Condition | Bonus |\n|-----------|-------|\n| Noble claimant fights personally | +20 |\n| Noble claimant does not fight personally | +0 |\n\nNote: \"Fights personally\" means present in the field for the campaign, bearing arms, subject to the same dangers as his men.\n\nTitle V: Titles and Estates\n\nArticle 21. The contribution system determines precedence in the granting of titles and estates in reconquered territories.\n\nArticle 22. Minimum thresholds for titles:\n\n| Title | Minimum Contribution Strength |\n|-------|------------------------------|\n| Minor estate / village lordship | 25 |\n| Prokathemenos (district administrator) | 50 |\n| Kephale (provincial governor) | 100 |\n| Doux (Duke / military governor) | 200 |\n| Megas Doux or equivalent | 400 |\n\nArticle 23. These thresholds are guidelines. The Emperor and the Defensor Romaniae may adjust based on strategic necessity and the availability of territories.\n\nArticle 24. Claims accumulate across multiple years of service. A house that contributes modestly but consistently may eventually outrank a house that contributed greatly once and then withdrew.\n\nArticle 25. Sacrifice is honored. A house that loses all its men in faithful service retains full credit for that year's contribution. Losses suffered in battle do not reduce recorded contribution.\n\nTitle VI: Special Provisions for Aragon\n\nArticle 26. Certain provisions are specific to Aragonese participation:\n\nArticle 27. Aragonese forces shall muster at Aragonese mustering points, under Aragonese marshals, before joining the combined host. This preserves Aragonese identity and ensures compliance with the fueros.\n\nArticle 28. Aragonese nobles with ancient claims in the East—whether from the Catalan Company's time or earlier—may present those claims to the Tribunal established under the Constitution. Claims derived from the Latin Empire of 1204 are void, but legitimate earlier claims receive the ×3 multiplier.\n\nArticle 29. The language of command for Aragonese contingents shall be Catalan or Aragonese, as appropriate. Interpreters shall be provided for coordination with contingents speaking other tongues.\n\nArticle 30. Aragonese laws regarding the treatment of prisoners, the division of plunder, and the conduct of war shall be honored within Aragonese contingents, except where they conflict with the requirements of unified command or the laws of Christendom regarding just war.\n\nCLOSING OF BOOK XI\n\nLet those who seek glory find it in the defense of Christendom. Let those who seek estates earn them with blood and courage. Let those who prefer safety remain home without shame, for not all men are called to every war.\n\nBut let no man say he was not offered the opportunity. The door stands open. The path to honor is clear. Those who walk it will be remembered; those who do not will be forgotten.\n\nDeus Vult.\n\nFINAL ATTESTATION\n\nThese three Books—the Ninth, Tenth, and Eleventh—are hereby added to the Fueros de Aragón by the consent of His Majesty Don Juan, King of Aragon, Count of Barcelona, King of Valencia, and the four estates of the realm assembled in Cortes at Zaragoza.\n\nThey shall have the same force and dignity as the ancient fueros, and shall be interpreted according to the same principles: in favor of liberty, in protection of ancient rights, and against the expansion of arbitrary power.\n\nDatum et actum in the City of Zaragoza, in the presence of the Cortes, in the year of Our Lord one thousand four hundred and thirty-seven.\n\nSealed by:\n\nHis Majesty Don Juan II\nKing of Aragon, Count of Barcelona, King of Valencia, King of Castile and León, Defensor Romaniae\n\nDon Martín Díez de Aux\nJusticia of Aragon\n\nDon Dalmau de Mur\nArchbishop of Zaragoza, speaking for the Ecclesiastical Estate\n\nDon Lope Ximénez de Urrea\nSpeaking for the Estate of Ricos Hombres\n\nDon Juan de Híjar\nSpeaking for the Estate of Caballeros\n\nDon Berenguer de Montcada\nSpeaking for the Estate of the Cities\n\nFinis\n\nMay God preserve the fueros.\nMay God preserve the realm.\nMay God preserve the king who keeps his oath.\nMay God grant victory to those who fight in His name.",

It\nreplaces the original Castilian naval development plan with a\ncomprehensive view of combined Christian naval power.\n\nPrimary Strategic Objectives\n\n1. Defense of Constantinople: Maintain sufficient naval presence to\nprevent Ottoman blockade and secure supply lines through the\nDardanelles.\n\n2. Military Projection: Capacity to deploy 25,000-35,000 soldiers\nfrom Iberia and Italy to the Eastern Mediterranean in a single campaign\nseason.\n\n3. Settler Transport: Continue annual convoys supporting\nConstantinople's population growth (target: 15,000-20,000 settlers\nannually).\n\n4. Naval Superiority: Maintain qualitative and quantitative\nadvantage over the Ottoman Imperial Fleet through 1445 and beyond.\n\nPART II: CURRENT FLEET STATUS (January 1438)\n\nA.

The chain across the\nmouth prevents enemy entry. However, basing a fleet requires more than\nanchorage: wharves, warehouses, repair facilities, crew housing, and\nsupply infrastructure.\n\nCurrent Capacity\n\nWarships supportable with existing facilities: 30-40\n\nThe Neorion shipyard (three functional slipways) can service 4-6 vessels\nat a time. Additional ships can anchor in the harbor but cannot be\nmaintained properly. Crew capacity: approximately 8,000-10,000 men\nthrough winter. Constantinople's current population (\\~85,000) can\nabsorb this garrison.\n\nApproved Expansion Program\n\nInvestment: 80,000 florins over 3-5 years\n\nTarget capacity: 80 warships with full support\n\n  ----------------------------------- ----------------- -----------------\n  Improvement                     Cost            Timeline\n                                      (florins)       \n\n  Dredge silted harbors (Neorion,     15,000            1438-1439\n  Prosphorion)                                          \n\n  Construct new wharves (20 berths)   25,000            1438-1440\n\n  Expand Neorion (2 additional        12,000            1439-1440\n  slipways)                                             \n\n  Naval warehouses (rope, canvas,     10,000            1438-1439\n  tar, timber)                                          \n\n  Crew barracks and facilities        8,000             1439-1441\n\n  Reserve fund and contingency        10,000            Ongoing\n\n  TOTAL                               80,000            1438-1443\n  ----------------------------------- ----------------- -----------------\n\nStrategic Implications\n\nWith 80-warship basing capacity at Constantinople, His Majesty can\nstation the combined fleet directly at the point of conflict. This\nnegates the Ottoman geographic advantage: our ships would be based where\nthe fighting occurs, not scattered across three seas requiring months to\nconcentrate.\n\nSupply lines remain dependent on passage through the Dardanelles. While\nthe truce holds, convoys can resupply the Constantinople base. In\nwartime, control of the Straits becomes essential.\n\nPART VII: FLEET PROJECTIONS (1438-1443)\n\nCombined Fleet Growth\n\n  ---------- ------------- ------------ ------------ ------------ -------------- -----------\n  Year   Castile   Orders   Aragon   Naples   Constple   TOTAL\n\n  1438       100           29           37           6            2              174\n\n  1439       115           33           39           10           5              202\n\n  1440       130           36           41           14           9              230\n\n  1441       142           39           43           18           13             255\n\n  1442       154           42           45           22           17             280\n\n  1443       166           45           47           26           21             305\n  ---------- ------------- ------------ ------------ ------------ -------------- -----------\n\nNote: Portuguese fleet (\\~32 vessels) not included in projections as\ngrowth depends on Prince Henry's exploration priorities.

This provides numerical superiority over the Ottoman\nfleet (\\~85 vessels) and qualitative superiority through Western carrack\ntechnology.\n\nBy 1443---two years before the Tenedos truce expires---the fleet will\ngrow to over 300 vessels with 180 warships, capable of deploying 35,000\nsoldiers to the Eastern Mediterranean in a single campaign season.\n\nThe approved Constantinople expansion (80,000 florins) will create\nbasing capacity for 80 warships, allowing concentration of forces at the\nstrategic center rather than scattered across three seas.\n\nThe fleet is built for His Majesty's purposes: the defense of\nConstantinople, the projection of Christian power, and---when the time\ncomes---the defeat of the Ottoman Empire.\n\nAPPROVED BY ROYAL AUTHORITY\n\nJuan II of Castile, León, Aragon, Sicily, Naples\n\nDefensor Romaniae\n\nToledo, January 1438",

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe Crown's economic development program, initiated in summer 1434, has\nachieved exceptional results. The comprehensive assessment roll of 80\n(Excellent) indicates that industries are performing at approximately\n130% of original projections.\n\nKey achievements include: paper mills generating 7,000 florins annually\n(projected 5,000); the Ghent textile consortium producing 5,000 florins\nannually with superior crimson dye techniques; Bilbao arms workshops\ndelivering 640 soldier's kits per year; and the wool breeding program\nshowing 15-20% finer clip quality, on pace to match English wool by\n1445.\n\nThis document consolidates all existing initiatives, documents their\ncurrent status, and outlines the new investments approved for\n1438-1440, totaling 56,400 florins in one-time expenditures and 10,800\nflorins in new annual costs.\n\nII\\. CROWN-OWNED INDUSTRIES\n\nThese industries are directly owned and operated by the Crown, with\nrevenues flowing to the royal treasury.\n\nA.

Potential specialization in\nnavigational charts and maps.\n\nB. Wool Breeding Program (Segovia/Extremadura)\n\nStatus: ON TRACK \\| Original Roll: 42 \\| Performance: Adequate,\nmeeting timeline\n\nThe Crown maintains royal breeding flocks with 16 smuggled English rams\n(6 Ryelands, 5 Cotswolds, 5 Lincolns) crossed with 640 selected Merino\newes.\n\n-   Spring 1438 Results: First crossbred clip harvested showing\n    15-20% finer fiber than baseline Merino\n\n-   Projection: On pace to match English wool quality by 1445\n\n-   Strategic Impact: Will enable domestic production of fine cloth\n    rivaling Flemish quality\n\nIII\\. CROWN-SUBSIDIZED INDUSTRIES\n\nThese industries are privately operated by foreign masters and their\nconsortiums, receiving Crown subsidies in exchange for knowledge\ntransfer and strategic production.\n\nA.

He operates openly under Crown protection. The knowledge has\ntaken root in Castile --- secrecy no longer serves strategic purpose.\n\nVenice Protocol: A diplomatic gift (500-800 florins of Castilian\ngoods) will be sent to Venice acknowledging their position but asserting\nthat Barbarigo is a free man in Castile. Royal charter declares any harm\nto him an offense against the Crown.\n\nIV\\. TRADITIONAL INDUSTRIES (ENHANCED)\n\nA. Granada Silk Industry\n\nStatus: FULLY RECOVERED \\| Pre-war capacity restored\n\n-   All silk thread now woven into cloth domestically (previously 1/3\n    sold raw to Genoese)\n\n-   50 additional silk looms operational\n\n-   Muslim craftsmen protected under amān, working productively\n\n-   Additional Revenue: +3,500 florins annually from value capture\n\nB. Córdoba Leather Industry\n\nStatus: EXPANDING \\| Investment: 3,000 florins (1434)\n\n-   Sumac plantations now maturing (3-5 year cycle completing)\n\n-   New tannery facility outside Córdoba city operational\n\n-   Guadamecí workshops established in Toledo and Seville\n\n-   Additional Revenue: +3,000 florins annually\n\nC.

Bronze supply occasionally disrupted. Two apprentices\npoached by Aragonese foundries.\n\nAdditional Investment (APPROVED): 6,000 florins one-time (master\nfounder recruitment 2,500 + domestic bronze supply 3,000 + apprentice\nretention 500). Target: 30 guns/year by late 1439.\n\nV. PROBLEM INDUSTRIES\n\nA. Málaga Ceramics --- Ibrahim al-Fakhkhar\n\nStatus: CRITICAL --- KNOWLEDGE WILL BE LOST\n\nIbrahim al-Fakhkhar (age 77) is the sole surviving master of Málaga's\ngolden lusterware technique. His son Ahmad was killed defending the\nPuerta de Granada during the conquest. His grandson Yusef fled to Fez.\n\nInterventions Attempted:\n\n1.  Personal letter from King Juan expressing grief and commissioning\n    work (Roll 11 --- suspicious distance)\n\n2.  Princess Catalina sent to Málaga to listen and ask why his art\n    matters (Roll 37 --- crack in wall)\n\nIbrahim's Message: \"Tell your king that beauty does not die with\nthe man who makes it. It dies when no one remembers why it mattered.\"\n\nCatalina's Outcome: Ibrahim permitted the visit. He showed his\nworkshop but explained nothing. When leaving, he said: \"You may come\nagain. If you wish.\"\n\nRoyal Decision: Ibrahim has made his choice. The Crown will honor\nit. Future contact will be to honor his craft and legacy, not to\nconvince. When he passes, his art passes with him. This will be mourned\nas something beautiful lost to the world.\n\nVI\\. NEW INVESTMENTS APPROVED (SUMMER 1438)\n\nThe following initiatives have been approved by His Majesty for\nimmediate implementation:\n\nA. Textile Industry Grand Expansion\n\nWith the wool breeding program showing results and the Ghent\nconsortium's exceptional performance, Castile will dramatically expand\nits textile capacity.\n\n  ------------------------------------- ---------------- ----------------\n  Component                         One-Time     Annual\n\n  Second workshop complex (Segovia)     6,000 fl         ---\n\n  Additional 100 looms                  4,500 fl         ---\n\n  Family relocation (12 families)       2,400 fl         ---\n\n  Training facility                     2,000 fl         ---\n\n  Dyeing expansion (Coppens crimson)    1,500 fl         ---\n\n  Warehouse for wool storage            1,200 fl         ---\n\n  Additional wages and retainers        ---              2,500 fl\n\n  Materials and maintenance             ---              1,500 fl\n\n  SUBTOTAL                          17,600 fl    4,000 fl\n  ------------------------------------- ---------------- ----------------\n\nStrategic Vision: By 1445, Castile will have capacity to weave all\ndomestically-produced wool into cloth.

      "full_text": "GRANADA SILVER MINING OPERATION\n\nComprehensive Administrative Charter\n\n1438 --- 1443\n\nPrepared by Diego de Daza, Chief Financial Administrator\n\nUnder the Authority of His Majesty King Juan II\n\nI. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nIn the year of Our Lord 1438, silver deposits of extraordinary richness\nwere discovered near Lanteira in the Sierra Nevada mountains of Granada.\nThe discovery, secured by Don García López de Padilla, Governor of\nGranada, represents a transformative blessing for the Crown of Castile.\n\nThe Crown has established an innovative mining system wherein the Crown\nprovides security, infrastructure, and refining facilities while\nindependent miners extract ore in exchange for thirty percent of the\nyield. This model harnesses private enterprise while ensuring Crown\ncontrol of the critical bottleneck: the refineries that transform raw\nore into precious metal.\n\nInitial operations in Q4 1438 generated 43,428 florins net revenue\nfrom a single refinery operating at capacity for approximately six\nweeks. Projections indicate annual net revenues of 250,000 to 300,000\nflorins by 1440---representing a 20-25% increase in total Crown\nrevenues.\n\nA second refinery has been authorized for construction, with completion\ntargeted for summer 1439. Additionally, a Royal Mint will be established\nin Toledo to convert the Crown's silver holdings into currency,\ncompleting the chain from ore extraction to circulating coinage.\n\nII\\. THE DISCOVERY\n\nA. Origin\n\nThe silver deposits were discovered by chance when a Moorish shepherd\nreported unusual stones to local authorities. Don García López de\nPadilla, recognizing the potential significance, immediately secured the\narea and commissioned expert assessment.\n\nGenoese mining assessors confirmed deposits of exceptional quality. The\nore body extends throughout the Lanteira district of the Sierra Nevada,\nwith veins reaching depths that suggest decades of productive\nextraction.\n\nB. Ore Quality\n\nThe Lanteira silver achieves 97% purity after refining---exceptional\nby any standard, and possibly the finest in all Christendom. Master\nRefiner Heinrich von Steinberg, with thirty-one years of experience in\nthe Freiberg mines of Saxony, declared upon examination:\n\n\"In thirty-one years, I have never seen ore like this.\"\n\nThe German ore requires three passes through the cupellation process;\nLanteira ore requires only two. The silver separates more cleanly,\nproducing metal of superior quality with reduced processing costs.\n\nIII\\. THE MINING MODEL\n\nA. The 70/30 Split\n\nThe Crown has established an innovative model that harnesses private\nenterprise while maintaining fiscal control. The principle is simple:\nore is worthless until refined. By controlling the refineries, the\nCrown controls the silver---regardless of who extracts it from the\nground.\n\nDivision of Yield:\n\n-   Crown Share: 70% of all refined silver\n\n-   Miner Share: 30% of all refined silver, paid directly upon\n    processing\n\nCrown Responsibilities:\n\n-   Security forces (1,000 men under a Crown Marshall)\n\n-   Road construction and maintenance\n\n-   Refinery construction and operation\n\n-   Administrative apparatus (registration, tribunals, inspectors)\n\n-   Equipment rental for mining groups\n\nMiner Responsibilities:\n\n-   Extraction of ore\n\n-   Transport of ore to refineries\n\n-   Tools and personal supplies (available for rental)\n\n-   Risk of finding productive veins\n\nB. Equipment Rental System\n\nRather than providing loans to starting miners---which creates complex\ndebtor relationships---the Crown provides equipment rental. Mining\ngroups may lease tools, carts, and supplies for modest weekly fees. If a\ngroup fails to find productive ore, they return the equipment and owe\nnothing. This avoids the moral complexity of debt collection while\nensuring miners have access to necessary tools.\n\nC. Miner Organization Requirements\n\nAll mining groups must comply with the following requirements:\n\n1.  Registration: Every mining group must register with Crown\n    administrators before commencing operations\n\n2.  Leadership: Each group must have a designated registered leader\n    responsible for the group's conduct\n\n3.  Profit Distribution: Equal distribution of profits among group\n    members is required; exploitation of workers is prohibited\n\n4.  Defined Claims: Mining groups operate within defined claim areas\n    assigned by Crown administrators\n\n5.  Compliance: All groups must comply with tribunal rulings and\n    Crown regulations\n\nD. Dispute Resolution\n\nA tribunal of three judges, rotating monthly, settles all disputes\nregarding claims, ore weights, payments, and conduct. The tribunal's\nauthority is absolute within its jurisdiction. Harsh penalties apply for\ntheft, violence, and fraud. During the first month of operations, the\ntribunal settled fourteen disputes; by month's end, this had dropped to\ntwo or three---demonstrating that clear, consistent enforcement\nestablishes order rapidly.\n\nIV\\. KEY PERSONNEL\n\nA. Master Refiner: Heinrich von Steinberg\n\n  ---------------------- ------------------------------------------------\n  Age                53 years\n\n  Origin             Freiberg, Saxony\n\n  Experience         31 years; former Obersteiger of Himmelfahrt\n                         mine; directed refining for Elector of Saxony\n\n  Salary             400 florins per year, plus housing\n\n  Bonus              0.5% of yield improvements attributable to his\n                         methods\n\n  Authority          Complete authority over all refining operations,\n                         answerable only to the Crown\n  ---------------------- ------------------------------------------------\n\nTeam Composition:\n\n-   12 journeymen from Saxony\n\n-   2 masters of the pattinson process (silver-lead separation producing\n    exceptional purity)\n\n-   Personal library of metallurgical texts not available outside Saxony\n\n-   Specialized tools and instruments of his own design\n\n-   Expertise in ventilation systems preventing lung-sickness\n\nB. Governor of Granada: Don García López de Padilla\n\nDon García provides overall administrative oversight of the mining\ndistrict. He discovered and secured the deposits, recruited initial\nlabor, and coordinates with von Steinberg on operational matters. His\nauthority extends to maintaining order, enforcing Crown regulations, and\nensuring smooth integration of mining activities with broader Granadan\nadministration.\n\nC. Additional Saxon Recruitment (Authorized)\n\nVon Steinberg has requested additional journeymen from Saxony---8 to 10\nmen---to staff the second refinery. Recruitment cost: approximately\n2,000 florins for travel and relocation. This request has been\napproved.\n\nV. INFRASTRUCTURE\n\nA. Security\n\n-   Force Strength: 1,000 men under a Crown Marshall\n\n-   Fortifications: Key access points secured; construction\n    completed 1438\n\n-   Purpose: Maintain order, protect ore transport, prevent\n    smuggling, enforce tribunal rulings\n\nB. Roads\n\nRoads capable of bearing heavy ore carts were completed by July\n1438---ahead of schedule. The construction employed laborers from\nGranada's population, providing honest wages and productive employment\nto men who might otherwise have turned to banditry. The road network\nconnects mining areas to the central refinery.\n\nC. Refineries\n\nFirst Refinery (Operational August 1438):\n\n-   Location selected by von Steinberg for proper drainage, water\n    access, ventilation, and defensibility\n\n-   Furnaces designed to von Steinberg's specifications\n\n-   Operating at full capacity since October 1438\n\n-   Ore carts now queue at gates---demand exceeds capacity\n\nSecond Refinery (APPROVED --- Target: Summer 1439):\n\n-   Location: Two leagues north of first refinery, site identified by\n    von Steinberg\n\n-   Construction cost: 15,000 --- 18,000 florins\n\n-   Will double processing capacity\n\n-   Additional Saxon journeymen to staff (recruitment authorized)\n\nVI\\. 1438 OPERATIONS AND RESULTS\n\nA.

The revenue from Q4 alone exceeds\nthe construction cost of the second refinery.\n\nVII\\. ROYAL MINT ESTABLISHMENT\n\nTo complete the chain from ore extraction to circulating currency, His\nMajesty has authorized the establishment of a Royal Mint in Toledo.\nThe mint will convert the Crown's silver (and future African gold) into\nstandardized coinage.\n\nA. Establishment Costs\n\n  ------------------------------------------- ---------------------------\n  Component                               Cost (Florins)\n\n  Secure facility (Toledo, near Alcázar)      8,000 --- 12,000\n\n  Dies, presses, furnaces, scales, testing    4,000 --- 6,000\n  equipment                                   \n\n  Recruitment of master minters (Germany or   3,000 --- 5,000\n  Italy)                                      \n\n  Initial security arrangements               1,500 --- 2,000\n\n  TOTAL ESTABLISHMENT                     16,500 --- 25,000\n  ------------------------------------------- ---------------------------\n\nB.

Seigniorage Revenue\n\nA well-run mint producing 200,000 florins equivalent of currency\nannually generates 4,000 to 8,000 florins in seigniorage\nprofit---the difference between face value and production cost. With the\nCrown controlling its own silver supply at 97% purity (purchased at no\nmarket cost), this margin increases considerably.\n\nNet Effect: The mint is expected to be revenue-neutral or slightly\nprofitable even before considering the strategic value of controlling\ncurrency production.\n\nD. Timeline and Initial Production\n\n-   Recruitment letters: Dispatched December 1438\n\n-   Master minter arrival: Expected Spring 1439\n\n-   Facility construction: Concurrent with recruitment\n\n-   Mint operational: Late Summer or Autumn 1439\n\n-   Initial production: Existing Castilian denominations (doblas in\n    gold, reales in silver)\n\nNote: The facility is designed for both gold and silver coinage. When\nHis Majesty determines the time is appropriate for new imperial\ndenominations, the dies can be changed within a day.\n\nVIII\\. FIVE-YEAR PROJECTIONS (1439-1443)\n\nA.

STRATEGIC SIGNIFICANCE\n\nThe Granada silver operation represents a transformation of the Crown's\nfinancial position. At projected maturity (1440 onwards), the mining\noperation alone will contribute 250,000 to 350,000 florins\nannually---an increase of 20-30% over pre-discovery Crown\nrevenues.\n\nThis revenue enables:\n\n-   Naval Expansion: Accelerated shipbuilding programs without\n    straining other revenue sources\n\n-   Military Readiness: Maintained standing forces and improved\n    equipment without additional taxation\n\n-   Constantinople Investment: Continued support for the eastern\n    settlement program\n\n-   Infrastructure Development: Roads, ports, and facilities across\n    the realm\n\n-   Industrial Investment: Continued development of textile, arms,\n    and other industries\n\n-   Currency Stability: A Crown-controlled mint producing\n    standardized coinage\n\nPerhaps most significantly, the silver provides the Crown with\nstrategic independence. Major initiatives need no longer depend on\nloans from Italian bankers, grants from the Cortes, or special levies\nthat breed resentment. The Crown can act according to its judgment,\nfunded by its own resources.\n\nApproved by Royal Authority\n\nJuan II of Castile\n\nToledo, Winter 1438\n\nPrepared by Diego de Daza\n\nChief Financial Administrator",

A great painting\neither teaches or commemorates a great occasion. A great sculpture might\ninspire the soul to Christian morals. There should always be a POINT to\nart. A beautiful painting of just a landscape could be a vision of the\nkingdom of heaven, the world as it should be, something to fight for.\n\nI will start a great art patronage program. From this day on, the Crown\nwill make the lands beautiful, so the life of everyone might be a little\nbit more uplifted, a bit more happy.\n\nThe rich and the poor, we are all equal before God. We are not equal in\nthis world, but a beautiful song lifts the spirit as much for a king as\nit does for a beggar.\"\n\n--- His Majesty King Juan II, Summer 1438\n\nI. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nHis Majesty has committed 400,000 florins over four years (100,000\nflorins annually from 1438-1442) to transform Castile from a kingdom of\nwarriors into a kingdom of beauty. Following this initial period, a\npermanent annual budget of 80,000 florins will sustain the arts in\nperpetuity.\n\nThe program encompasses seven major categories:\n\n1.  The Royal Chapel of Sound --- A church built for acoustics, open\n    to all\n\n2.  The Bridges of Saints --- Statues adorning the great crossings\n    of the realm\n\n3.  The Toledo Approaches --- Beautiful roads, shrines, and\n    monuments welcoming visitors\n\n4.  The Cathedral Works --- Granada new-built, Seville accelerated,\n    Burgos crowned\n\n5.  The Altarpiece Program --- Sacred art for churches throughout\n    the realm\n\n6.  Public Monuments --- Fountains, statues, and beauty in common\n    spaces\n\n7.  Recruitment and Training --- Foreign masters, Castilian students\n    abroad, workshops\n\nII\\.

THE CATHEDRAL WORKS\n\nPurpose: The great cathedrals declare the faith of a kingdom.\nGranada requires a cathedral worthy of the conquest. Seville's vast\nproject deserves royal support. Burgos awaits the crowning of its\nspires.\n\nA. Granada Cathedral (New Construction)\n\nThe converted mosque serves its purpose, but Granada deserves a\npurpose-built cathedral---a monument to the completion of the\nReconquista.

THE ALTARPIECE PROGRAM\n\nPurpose: Sacred art in every church---the Bible of the poor. Those\nwho cannot read may learn the stories of Christ and the saints through\nimages. A shepherd in Extremadura and a fisherman in Galicia should both\nsee beauty when they pray.\n\nA. Program Structure\n\nAltarpieces will be commissioned in three tiers based on church size and\nprominence:\n\n-   Grand Altarpieces (cathedrals, major churches): 800-1,500\n    florins each.

The figures reflect\nconditions as of Summer 1438, accounting for the effects of the Black\nDeath's lingering impact, the Reconquista's completion, and ongoing\nsettlement programs.\n\nPopulation recovery from the great mortality of 1348-1350 continues\nthroughout Christendom. The Iberian peninsula lost an estimated sixty\npercent of its inhabitants during that calamity, and recovery has been\ngradual. Your Majesty's economic development programs and the\nsettlement of Constantinople have accelerated growth in key regions.\n\nPart I: The Iberian Peninsula\n\nCrown of Castile\n\nThe Crown of Castile remains the most populous realm in Iberia,\nencompassing Old Castile, New Castile, León, Galicia, Asturias,\nExtremadura, Andalusia, and the newly conquered Emirate of Granada.\n\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Region                      Population   Notes\n  ------------------------------- ---------------- -----------------------\n  Old Castile (Burgos, Segovia,   650,000          Core heartland, stable\n  Ávila, Valladolid)                               growth\n\n  New Castile (Toledo, Madrid,    480,000          Economic development\n  Cuenca)                                          zone\n\n  León and Zamora                 320,000          Traditional settlement\n\n  Galicia                         380,000          Maritime population\n\n  Asturias and Cantabria          120,000          Mountain communities\n\n  Extremadura                     180,000          Frontier zone, Military\n                                                   Orders\n\n  Andalusia (Seville, Córdoba,    520,000          Fertile lands, trade\n  Jaén)                                            centers\n\n  Murcia                          90,000           Border region\n\n  Basque Provinces (Vizcaya,      140,000          Iron industry,\n  Guipúzcoa)                                       seafaring\n\n  Granada (formerly Nasrid        185,000          Muslim majority; silver\n  Emirate)                                         discovery\n\n  CASTILE TOTAL               3,065,000    \n  ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGranada Note: The conquest of 1433 disrupted population patterns\nsignificantly.

The following\nprojections assume continued peace and current development policies.\n\n  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Territory         1438     1439     1440     1442     1443\n  --------------------- ------------ ------------ ------------ ------------ ------------\n  Crown of Castile      3,065K       3,096K       3,127K       3,190K       3,222K\n\n  --- Granada alone     185K         192K         200K         215K         225K\n\n  Crown of Aragon       715K         719K         723K         730K         734K\n\n  Portugal              810K         818K         826K         843K         851K\n\n  Navarre               95K          95.5K        96K          97K          97.5K\n\n  Naples                1,100K       1,106K       1,111K       1,122K       1,128K\n\n  Sicily                450K         452K         454K         459K         461K\n\n  Constantinople        85K          95K          105K         125K         135K\n\n  Byzantine Other       85K          86K          87K          89K          90K\n\n  TOTAL             6,490K   6,568K   6,629K   6,755K   6,719K\n  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nKey Growth Factors:\n\nGranada: The silver discovery at Lanteira is attracting miners and\ntheir families. Continued Christian settlement from northern Castile.\nGrowth rate approximately 3-4% annually---the highest in Iberia.\n\nConstantinople: Active settlement program continues drawing Iberian\nand Italian families. Military Orders expanding presence. Growth rate\napproximately 10-12% annually through migration---extraordinary but\ndependent on continued Ottoman truce.\n\nPortugal: Atlantic exploration providing outlet for population\npressure. Growth steady at approximately 1% annually.\n\nRisk Factors: Plague recurrence remains the greatest threat---any\noutbreak could reverse years of growth. The Ottoman truce expires in\n1445; warfare would devastate Constantinople's recovery. Aragonese\ninvolvement in Italian conflicts could affect Naples and Sicily\npopulations through military losses and economic disruption.\n\nConclusion\n\nBy 1443, should current trends continue, the population of territories\nunder Your Majesty's direct rule, alliance, or protection may approach\n6.7 to 6.8 million souls. Castile alone should exceed 3.2 million.\nConstantinople, if the settlement program maintains its momentum, could\nreach 130,000-140,000---approaching a third of its ancient glory.\n\nThe completion of the Reconquista in 1433 was not merely a military\ntriumph but a demographic foundation. The fertile lands of Granada, now\naugmented by silver wealth, will draw settlers for generations. The\nApokatastasis represents a similar foundation for the East---the\nbeginning of a new Latin-Greek civilization in the heart of the ancient\nRoman world.\n\nPrepared by the Office of Royal Administration under the direction of\nDon Diego de Daza.\n\nSubmitted to His Majesty Juan II, King of Castile and León, Defensor\nRomaniae, in the Year of Our Lord 1438.",

PURPOSE AND SCOPE\n\nThis document establishes the operational framework for the Second\nImperial Muster, to be conducted across all territories under the Crown\nduring Summer 1438. The muster serves three purposes:\n\n1.  To test and refine the voluntary muster system established in 1437\n\n2.  To train officers and men in coordinated movement and field\n    operations\n\n3.  To build unity across territories through shared experience and\n    celebration\n\nThe First Muster (1437) produced an extraordinary response of 12,437\nmen across all territories. This second muster will test whether these\nforces can execute coordinated operations under unified command.\n\nII\\. COMMAND STRUCTURE\n\nCentral Administration\n\n-   Don Álvaro de Luna --- Head of Imperial Administration\n\n-   Diego de Daza --- Chief Administrator, reporting standards and\n    logistics\n\n-   Sir Thomas Beaumont --- War Academy coordination, officer\n    deployment\n\nRoyal Participation\n\nHis Majesty King Juan II will personally command the Toledo muster,\nmarching with the troops to Arévalo and commanding the cavalry during\nfield exercises. Prince Fernando, Prince of Asturias (age 4) and\nPrincess Catalina (age 6) will accompany the King, demonstrating the\nTrastámara commitment to shared service.\n\nAcademy Officers\n\nAll graduates of the Royal Military Academy (43 officers) plus current\nsenior cadets (22) will be deployed across the fifteen exercises. Each\nendpoint will receive 3-4 academy-trained personnel serving as either\ncommanders or observers. Officers will submit written assessments of\neach exercise within fourteen days of completion.\n\nIII\\. OPERATIONAL CONCEPT\n\nPhase One: Assembly\n\nMen assemble at designated mustering points. Officers conduct roll call\nand organize units into march formations. Destination is revealed only\nafter assembly is complete---testing officers' ability to lead under\nuncertainty.\n\nPhase Two: March\n\nEach muster conducts a 3-5 day march to its assigned destination. Routes\nare chosen to present varied terrain challenges: river crossings,\nmountain passes, forced marches, and night movements as appropriate.\nLocal commanders bear full responsibility for march discipline, supply,\nand timing.\n\nPhase Three: Combination\n\nWhere possible, two musters converge at a single destination. Men from\ndifferent regions meet, learn to form combined units, and recognize\nthemselves as part of a unified imperial force rather than separate\nregional levies.\n\nPhase Four: Field Exercises\n\nUpon arrival at the destination, forces assemble immediately into battle\nformations. Standardized drills are conducted:\n\n1.  Infantry Defensive Formation --- Units form defensive square or\n    line on command\n\n2.  Ranged Volley --- Crossbow and archer formations advance and\n    loose at marked targets\n\n3.  Cavalry Maneuver --- Mounted units execute flanking movement on\n    signal\n\n4.  Artillery Demonstration --- Where available, field cannon fired\n    2-3 times (supervised by academy officers)\n\nPhase Five: Celebration\n\nFollowing successful completion of exercises, the Crown provides a feast\nfor all participants. Food and drink are purchased locally at fair\nprices, stimulating the regional economy. The muster concludes with men\ndeparting in good spirits, having accomplished something meaningful\ntogether.\n\nIV\\.

ADMINISTRATIVE STANDARDS\n\nOfficial Language\n\nLatin shall serve as the administrative language for all\ninter-territorial communications. All reports, orders, and official\ncorrespondence between territories and the central administration in\nToledo shall be composed in Latin. Local administration may continue in\nvernacular languages as appropriate.\n\nOfficer Rotation\n\nCrown marshalls and tax assessors shall be rotated between territories\nevery three to five years, where language competency permits. This\nrotation prevents the development of local loyalties that might conflict\nwith imperial interests and ensures administrators maintain perspective\non the whole rather than their assigned region alone.\n\nReporting Standards\n\nAll territorial administrators shall submit reports in standardized\nformat, enabling comparison across the empire:\n\n1.  Quarterly Reports: Revenues, expenses, notable events\n\n2.  Annual Reviews: Comprehensive territorial assessment\n\n3.  Muster Reports: Within 14 days of exercise completion\n\nGiven at Toledo, in the Month of January, Anno Domini 1438\n\nJUAN II\n\nRex Castellae et Legionis, Aragonum, Neapolis et Siciliae\n\nDefensor Romaniae",

Gold Trade Results\n\nDespite infrastructure limitations, gold trade has achieved viability.\nThe Treaty of Timbuktu secured preferential treatment from Mansa Mahmud\nII, and Ambassador Musa Keita facilitated productive relationships with\nMalian merchants.\n\nAnnual Gold Receipts\n\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Year          Gold (lbs)    Value           Voyages\n                                      (florins)       \n  ----------------- ----------------- ----------------- -----------------\n  1440              350               5,600             3\n\n  1441              550               8,800             4\n\n  1442              750               12,000            5\n\n  1443              900               14,400            6\n\n  1444              1,000             16,000            7\n\n  TOTAL         3,550         56,800        25\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNote: Initial expedition (1437-1439) returned 600 lbs gold separately.\nFive-year program total including initial haul: approximately 4,150\nlbs.\n\nTrade Goods Exchanged\n\nExports to Mali:\n\n-   Salt (primary): \\~500,000-600,000 lbs shipped annually by 1444\n\n-   Chain mail armor (gifts to Mansa): 50 sets over 5 years\n\n-   Toledo steel weapons (gifts): 200 swords, 100 spear-points\n\n-   Horses (gifts and trade): 35 horses delivered (high mortality en\n    route)\n\nImports from Mali:\n\n-   Gold bullion (primary): 1,000 lbs annually by 1444\n\n-   Ivory: \\~2,000 lbs annually\n\n-   Malagueta pepper: \\~500 lbs annually\n\n-   Manuscripts and scholarly works (gifts from Mansa)\n\nIV\\.

Strategic Assessment\n\nThe African Trade Enterprise has achieved its primary objective:\nestablishing a viable alternative route for African gold that bypasses\nthe Maghrebi-controlled trans-Saharan caravans. While infrastructure\nlimitations constrain current volumes, the venture demonstrates clear\npotential for expansion.\n\nStrengths:\n\n-   Treaty of Timbuktu provides exceptional diplomatic foundation\n\n-   Salt production capacity far exceeds current trade route capacity\n\n-   Malian merchants actively prefer Castilian salt over desert caravans\n\n-   Direct Crown control eliminates intermediary margins\n\nWeaknesses:\n\n-   Insufficient caravels limit voyage frequency\n\n-   Disease continues to claim garrison troops\n\n-   Only one intermediate outpost operational\n\n-   Dependence on Portuguese pilots and expertise\n\nRecommendations:\n\n-   Commission 3-4 additional caravels (est. cost: 14,000 florins)\n\n-   Establish second intermediate outpost with better site selection\n\n-   Implement seasonal garrison rotation to reduce disease losses\n\n-   Train Castilian pilots to reduce Portuguese dependence\n\n-   Consider horse breeding program in Canaries to reduce transport\n    mortality\n\nPrepared and submitted this day,\n\nDon Álvaro de Luna\n\nConstable of Castile\n\nToledo, Spring 1444",

      "full_text": "PLAN FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF\n\nMADRID\n\nIMPERIAL CAPITAL OF THE CROWNS\n\nA Ten-Year Program of Construction\n\nCommissioned by His Most Christian Majesty\n\nJUAN II\n\nKing of Castile, León, Aragon, Naples, and Sicily\n\nDefensor Romaniae\n\nAnno Domini MCDXXXIX\n\nPrepared by the Royal Architects:\n\nMaestro Lorenzo de Palencia --- Master of Castilian Construction\n\nMaestro Giorgio di Montepulciano --- Master of Italian Design\n\nMaestro Willem van der Berg --- Master of Practical Engineering\n\nPART I: THE VISION\n\nPurpose and Intent\n\nHis Majesty King Juan II, having united under his sovereign authority\nthe Crowns of Castile, León, Aragon, Naples, and Sicily, and bearing the\nsacred title of Defensor Romaniae as protector of Constantinople and the\nChristian East, requires a capital befitting the dignity and scope of\nthis unprecedented realm.\n\nThe ancient city of Toledo, though venerable in history and hallowed by\ntradition, is constrained by its terrain and cannot accommodate the\nadministrative, ceremonial, and symbolic requirements of an empire\nspanning from the Atlantic to the Mediterranean. Therefore, His Majesty\nhas determined to construct a new capital at Madrid, transforming a\nmodest town into the seat of Christian imperium.\n\nThe Iota Concept\n\nThe city shall embody the symbol of His Majesty's reign: the Greek\nletter Iota (Ι), first letter of Ioannes, the royal name rendered in the\ntongue of the Eastern Empire. As the Chi-Rho proclaimed Constantine's\ndevotion to Christ, so shall the Iota proclaim the unity of the\nChristian realms under Juan's protection.\n\nThe city plan follows the form of the Iota: a great central avenue\nrunning north to south---the vertical stroke---intersected by three\ngreat plazas representing the horizontal bars of the letter. The city\nrises from north to south, so that all who enter ascend toward the\nthrone, the cathedral, and the great Iota Monument that crowns the\nwhole.\n\nUrban Design Principles\n\nThe city shall be built according to the principles of the città\nideale---the ideal city---as conceived by the masters of Florence and\nRome. Streets shall radiate with purpose. Buildings shall stand in\nproportion to one another. Light and air shall flow freely. The chaos of\nmedieval growth shall give way to rational order.\n\nYet this order serves humanity, not mere geometry. Public fountains\nshall ensure no citizen walks more than five minutes for clean water.\nSewers beneath the streets shall carry waste away. Paved roads shall\nbanish mud and disease. Heated buildings shall make winter bearable.\nMadrid shall be not merely beautiful, but livable---a gift to its people\nas much as a monument to its king.\n\nPART II: THE BUILDINGS\n\n1. The Palace of Light (Palacio de la Luz)\n\nTotal Cost: 180,000 florins --- Construction: Years 1-6\n\nThe royal palace shall be built in the new Italian style, emphasizing\nlight, air, and harmony rather than defensive fortification. The age of\nMoorish raids has passed; the palace need not be a fortress. Instead, it\nshall awe visitors with beauty and proclaim the confidence of a secure\nand prosperous realm.\n\nPrincipal Chambers:\n\n• The Throne Room: A great hall of one hundred feet in length, with\ncoffered ceiling rising thirty feet. Windows on three sides flood the\nspace with light. The throne stands on a raised dais at the southern\nend, so that all who approach walk toward the light.\n\n• The Council of Realms Chamber: Adjacent to the throne room, connected\nby a grand archway. A round chamber with domed ceiling, embodying the\nprinciple of equality among the five realms. Five great windows face the\ncardinal directions and the heavens, representing Castile, Aragon,\nNaples, Sicily, and Constantinople united under God.\n\n• Administrative Wings: East and west wings extending from the main\nstructure, housing the Royal Treasury offices, Crown Marshalls'\nchambers, tax assessors, the Royal Secretariat, diplomatic meeting\nrooms, and archives. Capacity for fifty officials working simultaneously\nin each wing.\n\n• Royal Apartments: A private wing at the rear, overlooking gardens\ndescending toward the Manzanares. Connected to the seat of power by a\nsingle corridor, allowing His Majesty to move from private father to\npublic king in thirty paces.\n\n2. The Cortes Building (Casa de las Cortes)\n\nTotal Cost: 85,000 florins --- Construction: Years 2-5\n\nA single great building organized so each estate maintains dignity and\nprivacy, arranged around a central courtyard.\n\nThe Three Wings:\n\n• The Clerical Wing: Seating for sixty members---bishops, abbots, and\ncathedral chapters. An attached chapel for prayer before sessions.\n\n• The Noble Wing: Seating for one hundred members---the great houses and\nlesser nobility. Decorated with the arms of every lineage represented.\n\n• The Commons Wing: Seating for ninety members---representatives of the\ncities. Simpler decoration, but no less dignified in proportion and\nlight.\n\n• The Great Hall: A semicircular chamber where all three estates gather\nfor opening ceremonies, royal addresses, and final votes. Rising tiers\nfocus on a central podium. Acoustics designed so a speaker can be heard\nin every seat without shouting. Total capacity: 250 members plus\nobservers in gallery.\n\n3. The Royal Chapel (Capilla Real)\n\nTotal Cost: 45,000 florins --- Construction: Years 1-3\n\nA jewel box for prayer---small but perfect. Seating for one hundred: the\nroyal family, household, and honored guests. Every surface shall sing\nwith meaning.\n\nWalls of white marble inlaid with gold. A great altarpiece depicting the\nReconquista and the defense of Constantinople. Windows of colored glass\ntelling the story of salvation. A choir loft for the singers recruited\nthrough the Great Patronage Program. This chapel shall be complete\nwithin three years, providing a place of worship long before the great\ncathedral rises.\n\n4. The Cathedral of Madrid\n\nTotal Cost: 400,000 florins over 25-30 years (100,000 in first decade)\n\nThe great work of generations. A cathedral to rival Burgos, Toledo, and\nSeville---perhaps to surpass them all.\n\nSpecifications:\n\n• Length: 400 feet from western doors to eastern apse\n\n• Width: 150 feet across the transepts\n\n• Height: Central tower rising 300 feet, visible from twenty miles\n\n• Capacity: 5,000 worshippers\n\nConstruction shall proceed in stages: foundations and lower walls in the\nfirst decade; nave and aisles in the second; transepts and choir in the\nthird; towers and ornamentation thereafter. From the first year, a\nconsecrated space shall exist for worship. The people of Madrid shall\nsee their cathedral rising around them, stone by stone, year by year---a\nliving testament to faith.\n\n5. The Iota Monument (La Torre del Iota)\n\nTotal Cost: 120,000 florins --- Construction: Years 2-9\n\nThe heart of everything. The symbol made stone. Rising at the highest\npoint of the city, visible from every quarter and from miles beyond.\n\nThe Pedestal Base:\n\n• A massive square structure, 100 feet on each side, 60 feet tall\n\n• Built of white limestone reinforced with iron\n\n• Four grand staircases, one on each face\n\n• Interior chambers for guards, storage, and maintenance\n\n• Summit platform with views across the entire city\n\nThe Iota Tower:\n\n• Rising from the pedestal center, an additional 140 feet (200 feet\ntotal from street)\n\n• Rectangular cross-section: 30 feet by 15 feet---unmistakably the\nvertical stroke\n\n• Three observation galleries at the horizontal bars of the Iota:\n\n--- Lowest gallery (80 feet): Views of the city\n\n--- Middle gallery (130 feet): Views of the countryside\n\n--- Highest gallery (180 feet): Views to the Guadarrama and Toledo\n\n• Internal spiral staircase of 400 steps\n\n• Great golden cross surmounting the pinnacle: Faith above empire, God\nabove king\n\n6. The Citadel and Barracks\n\nTotal Cost: 90,000 florins --- Construction: Years 1-5\n\nA fortress within the city, south of the cathedral on a slight rise.\nStar-shaped walls in the modern style, angled to deflect cannon fire.\nThe city itself remains open, but the citadel provides refuge should\nMadrid ever face threat.\n\nFacilities:\n\n• Barracks for 2,000 soldiers\n\n• Armories and stables\n\n• Independent water supply from deep wells\n\n• Stores sufficient for six months' siege\n\n• Royal Treasury Vaults beneath the citadel, carved into bedrock:\nmultiple chambers with iron doors, each requiring separate keys held by\ndifferent officials\n\n7. Infrastructure\n\nTotal Cost: 180,000 florins --- Construction: Years 1-10\n\nThe invisible work that makes a city function---more important than any\nmonument.\n\nWater System:\n\n• Aqueduct from the Guadarrama foothills, fifteen miles distant\n\n• Twelve public fountains along the Via Iota and major plazas\n\n• No citizen shall walk more than five minutes for clean water\n\nSanitation:\n\n• Underground sewers carrying waste to the Manzanares downstream\n\n• All major buildings connected from initial construction\n\nStreets:\n\n• Via Iota: Sixty feet wide, paved in stone, lined with trees\n\n• Major streets paved in stone; secondary streets in compacted gravel\n\n• Oil lamps at major intersections, maintained by city watch\n\nHeating:\n\n• Hypocaust system for all major buildings\n\n• Warm floors throughout winter in palace, Cortes, and public buildings\n\n8. The Royal Residence (Casa del Rey)\n\nTotal Cost: 50,000 florins --- Construction: Years 3-6\n\nA private home within the palace grounds but separate from the Palace of\nLight. Connected by covered walkway, yet maintaining its own gardens,\nentrance, and peace. A place for family, for children, for the private\nlife of the sovereign.\n\nPrivate apartments for the King and Queen. Nurseries and schoolrooms for\nthe royal children. Gardens with fruit trees, fountains, and space for\nplay. A private chapel for family devotions. Quarters for personal\nservants and the shadow guard.\n\n9. The Hall of the Faithful\n\nTotal Cost: 20,000 florins --- Construction: Years 4-6\n\nA chapel connected to the citadel, dedicated to those who sacrificed for\nothers---the shield against the dark, the sword protecting the innocent.\nThe names of those who died defending Constantinople inscribed upon its\nwalls. Soldiers and knights shall pass through this hall on their way to\nduty, reminded daily of what they serve and why sacrifice has meaning.\n\n10. The Royal Baths (Baños Reales)\n\nTotal Cost: 30,000 florins --- Construction: Years 5-8\n\nPublic baths in the Roman style, heated year-round by the hypocaust\nsystem. One facility for men, one for women, one for the royal\nhousehold. The Moors understood the value of public bathing; this wisdom\nshall not be abandoned simply because it came from infidels.\nCleanliness, health, and a gift to the common people.\n\n11. The Commercial Exchange (Lonja)\n\nTotal Cost: 30,000 florins --- Construction: Years 6-9\n\nA grand building in the lower plaza where merchants and bankers conduct\nbusiness under one roof. The crown builds it; merchants pay fees to use\nit. Space reserved nearby for banking houses---the Medici, the Genoese,\nthe Venetians, the Fuggers---who will establish branches in the imperial\ncapital. The Lonja shall become self-sustaining within a few years of\ncompletion.\n\n12. Treasury Vaults\n\nTotal Cost: 15,000 florins --- Construction: Years 2-4\n\nBeneath the citadel, vaults carved deep into bedrock to house His\nMajesty's treasury---currently exceeding 1,200,000 florins and growing\nannually. Multiple chambers with iron doors. Each door requiring\nseparate keys held by different officials. Walls of stone so thick no\ntool could breach them in less than a week. Designed against fire,\nflood, and treachery.\n\nPART III: BUDGET AND TIMELINE\n\nProject Summary\n\n  -------------------------------------- --------------- -----------------\n  PROJECT

Sustainability\n\nThe Granada silver mines alone produce 250,000 florins annually. The\nentire Madrid project, spread over ten years, consumes on average\n134,500 florins per year---approximately half of this single revenue\nstream. Combined revenues from all realms exceed 500,000 florins\nannually.\n\nTherefore, even during peak construction years, the Royal Treasury will\ncontinue to grow. By the time Madrid is complete in 1449, the treasury\nwill be larger than it is today, not smaller. This project is not merely\naffordable---it is sustainable without strain upon the realm's finances\nor its people.\n\nPART IV: ADMINISTRATION\n\nProject Governance\n\nThe construction of Madrid shall be overseen by a Royal Construction\nCouncil comprising:\n\n• Maestro Lorenzo de Palencia --- Chief Architect, responsible for\noverall construction\n\n• Maestro Giorgio di Montepulciano --- Design Architect, responsible for\naesthetic vision\n\n• Maestro Willem van der Berg --- Chief Engineer, responsible for\ninfrastructure\n\n• A representative of the Royal Treasury, responsible for disbursements\n\n• A representative of the Crown Marshall, responsible for security\n\nThis council shall meet monthly to review progress, resolve disputes,\nand adjust plans as necessary. Quarterly reports shall be submitted to\nHis Majesty.\n\nLabor and Materials\n\nConstruction will require:\n\n• 2,000-3,000 laborers at peak activity (Years 3-5)\n\n• Master craftsmen recruited from across Castile, Aragon, Italy, and\nFlanders\n\n• Stone quarried from the Guadarrama mountains\n\n• Timber from the forests of Old Castile\n\n• Iron from the Basque country\n\n• Glass from Venetian workshops\n\n• Marble imported from Italy for the finest works\n\nLabor camps shall be established near the construction site, with\nprovisions for housing, feeding, and caring for workers. Fair wages\nshall be paid promptly. The construction of Madrid shall demonstrate\nChristian justice as well as Christian ambition.\n\nFuture Growth\n\nThis plan establishes the bones of Madrid---the principal buildings, the\ninfrastructure, the monuments. But a city is more than its great works.\nSpace has been reserved for:\n\n• Noble townhouses along streets near the palace\n\n• Merchant residences and guild halls in the commercial district\n\n• Common housing in surrounding quarters\n\n• Banking houses near the Lonja\n\n• Churches and convents as the population requires\n\n• Schools, hospitals, and charitable institutions\n\nPrivate construction shall follow crown-established standards: maximum\nheights, minimum street widths, required connection to sewers, approved\nmaterials. Madrid shall grow according to plan, not accident. Within\ntwenty years, a city of 50,000. Within fifty years, perhaps 100,000. The\ninfrastructure we build now shall support generations of growth.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThis plan represents the labor of three architects and the vision of a\nking. It proposes to build, within ten years, a capital worthy of an\nempire---a city that proclaims the unity of five crowns, the triumph of\nChristian faith, and the dawn of a new age.\n\nThe cost is great but sustainable. The labor is immense but achievable.\nThe vision is bold but grounded in the practical realities of stone,\nwater, and human effort.\n\nWhen complete, Madrid will stand as testament to what can be\naccomplished when resources, will, and faith align. The Iota will rise\nabove the plains of Castile, visible for miles, declaring to all who see\nit: here is the heart of Christian empire. Here is the seat of Juan,\nDefensor Romaniae. Here is the capital of the crowns.\n\n--- FINIS ---\n\nSubmitted for Royal Approval:\n\n+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+\n| \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\     | \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\     |\n| _\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ | _\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ |\n|                                   |                                   |\n| Maestro Lorenzo de Palencia       | Maestro Giorgio di Montepulciano  |\n+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+\n| \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\     | \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\     |\n| _\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ | _\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ |\n|                                   |                                   |\n| Maestro Willem van der Berg       | Diego de Daza, Royal Treasury     |\n+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+\n\nAPPROVED BY ROYAL SEAL\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nJUAN II\n\nKing of Castile, León, Aragon, Naples, and Sicily\n\nDefensor Romaniae",

      "full_text": "[CONVENTIO BANCARIA]\n\nAgreement Between the Crown and the House of Medici\n\nFlorence, the Twenty-Eighth Day of July, in the Year of Our Lord 1439\n\n[BE IT KNOWN TO ALL] that this agreement is made between\nHis Most Catholic Majesty Juan II, by the Grace of God King of\nCastile, León, Granada, Aragon, Naples, and Sicily, Defensor Romaniae,\nhereinafter referred to as \"the Crown\", and Cosimo di Giovanni\nde' Medici, principal of the Banco dei Medici of Florence,\nhereinafter referred to as \"the Bank\".\n\nWHEREAS the Crown and the Bank, recognizing the mutual benefit of\ncooperation between sovereign authority and financial enterprise, and\nacknowledging that each institution serves purposes distinct yet\ncomplementary, do hereby establish the following terms of association:\n\n[ARTICLE I: THE GUARANTEED DEPOSIT]\n\nThe Crown shall maintain with the Bank a deposit of three hundred\nthousand florins (300,000 fl.), to be held as guaranteed working\ncapital for a period of no less than ten years from the date of this\nagreement.\n\nThis deposit may be liquidated at a maximum rate of thirty thousand\nflorins (30,000 fl.) per annum. The Crown agrees not to demand\nwithdrawal exceeding this amount in any calendar year, thereby providing\nthe Bank with stable capital for its lending operations.\n\nIn consideration of this guaranteed capital, the Bank shall pay to the\nCrown interest at the rate of four percent (4%) per annum, amounting\nto twelve thousand florins (12,000 fl.) annually, payable in quarterly\ninstallments to the Crown's designated treasury.\n\n[ARTICLE II: ADDITIONAL DEPOSITS AND WITHDRAWALS]\n\nAny funds held by the Bank on behalf of the Crown in excess of the\nguaranteed deposit of three hundred thousand florins shall be\ntransferred to the Crown's central treasury in Toledo or Madrid on a\nquarterly basis, unless otherwise directed by the Crown's\ntreasurer.\n\nFor withdrawals exceeding fifty thousand florins (50,000 fl.) in any\nsingle transaction, the Crown shall provide the Bank with notice of\nthirty (30) days to allow for proper management of liquidity.\n\n[ARTICLE III: TRANSACTION FEES]\n\nFor all transfers and transactions conducted within the Crown's\nterritories---including but not limited to Castile, Granada, Aragon,\nNaples, and Sicily---the Bank shall charge a cambium of two percent\n(2%).\n\nFor transfers to territories outside the Crown's direct\nsovereignty---including France, England, the German states, and the\nItalian republics---the Bank shall charge three percent (3%),\nreflecting the additional complexity and risk of such operations.\n\nFor transactions involving Constantinople, the rate of three percent\n(3%) shall apply until such time as the Bank establishes a permanent\nbranch there. After three years of stable operations, this rate shall be\nsubject to renegotiation.\n\n[ARTICLE IV: THE IOTA CURRENCY]\n\nThe Crown has minted a new coin, designated the Iota (Ι), weighted\nprecisely to the Florentine florin standard and interchangeable\ntherewith in all commercial transactions.\n\nWhen disbursing funds to subjects of the Crown within the Crown's\nterritories---including but not limited to soldiers, suppliers, and\ncreditors---the Bank shall pay in Iota coin where practical and\navailable. This requirement applies solely to payments to the Crown's\nown subjects and does not extend to the Bank's other clients or\noperations.\n\nIn consideration of this obligation, the Crown hereby guarantees by\nroyal charter that the Iota shall maintain its present weight and purity\nfor the duration of this agreement. The Crown shall not debase,\ndiminish, or alter the standard of the Iota without providing the Bank\none year's notice and renegotiating terms as necessary.\n\n[ARTICLE V: BANKING PRESENCE]\n\nThe Bank currently maintains branches in Naples and Barcelona,\nwith correspondent arrangements in Valencia. For as long as the Bank\nprovides transaction services within the Crown's territories under the\nterms described herein, the Crown shall maintain the guaranteed deposit\nas specified in Article I.\n\nThe Bank agrees to consider in good faith the establishment of a branch\nin Constantinople, recognizing the strategic importance of the\nCrown's eastern possessions and the commercial opportunities therein.\n\n[ARTICLE VI: FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS]\n\nThe Crown has expressed intention to develop systems integrating harbour\ntransactions with banking services, whereby merchants may conduct trade\nand remit duties through letters of credit rather than physical\ntransport of coin. The Bank expresses interest in participating in such\nsystems should they be enacted with the support of the relevant trading\nguilds.\n\nSuch future arrangements shall be the subject of separate negotiation\nand agreement, and nothing in this document commits either party to\nspecific terms not yet determined.\n\n[ARTICLE VII: INDEPENDENCE AND NEUTRALITY]\n\nBoth parties acknowledge that the Bank serves clients throughout\nChristendom and that its reputation for independence and neutrality is\nessential to its function. Nothing in this agreement shall be construed\nto make the Bank an instrument of the Crown's policy or to compromise\nthe Bank's ability to serve other clients.\n\nLikewise, the Crown retains full sovereignty over its financial affairs\nand may establish additional banking relationships or its own financial\ninstitutions as it sees fit, without prejudice to the terms herein\nagreed.\n\n[IN WITNESS WHEREOF], the parties have set their hands\nand seals on the date first written above.\n\n+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+\n| \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\   | \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\   |\n| _\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ | _\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ |\n|                                   |                                   |\n| JUAN II                       | COSIMO DE' MEDICI            |\n|                                   |                                   |\n| King of Castile, León, Granada,   | Principal of the Banco dei Medici |\n|                                   |                                   |\n| Aragon, Naples, and Sicily        | of Florence                       |\n|                                   |                                   |\n| Defensor Romaniae               |                                   |\n+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+\n\n[WITNESSES:]\n\nSer Giovanni di Niccolò Benci, Notary of Florence\n\nDon Álvaro de Luna, Constable of Castile\n\nIlarione de' Bardi, Manager of the Medici Bank of Rome\n\n\\~ Executed in duplicate, one copy to be held by each party \\~",

      "full_text": "ORDINATIO MARESCALLORUM CORONAE\n\nOrdinance of the Crown Marshalls\n\nProclaimed at Toledo, Anno Domini 1439\n\nPREAMBLE\n\nJUAN, by the Grace of God, King of Castile and León, of Aragon, of\nNaples and Sicily, Defender of Romania, to all lords temporal and\nspiritual, to all officers of the Crown, and to all faithful subjects of\nOur realms, greeting and grace.\n\nWHEREAS the collection of lawful revenues is essential to the defence of\nChristendom, the administration of justice, and the welfare of Our\npeoples; and WHEREAS certain difficulties have arisen in the execution\nof this sacred duty; We do hereby ordain and establish the following\nprocedures for the governance of Our Crown Marshalls and the protection\nof Our tax assessors.\n\nPART I: THE THREE-STRIKE PROCEDURE\n\nArticle 1: Definition of a Strike\n\nA strike shall be recorded against any lord, vassal, or landholder when\nany of the following occurs:\n\n> (a) Failure to provide requested documentation within a reasonable\n> timeframe as determined by the assessor;\n>\n> (b) Deliberate obstruction, delay, or deception in the assessment\n> process;\n>\n> (c) Refusal to permit access to accounts, properties, or records\n> required for assessment;\n>\n> (d) Any threat, intimidation, or hostile act directed at a Crown\n> assessor or marshall, whether explicit or implicit;\n>\n> (e) Non-payment of assessed obligations without valid dispute or\n> arrangement.\n\nArticle 2: Recording and Accumulation\n\nAll strikes shall be recorded in the central registry maintained by the\nRoyal Treasury at Toledo. Strikes accumulate against each household\nregardless of which specific assessor or marshall filed the report.\nRecords shall be maintained in perpetuity and may be cited in any future\nproceedings.\n\nArticle 3: Consequence of Three Strikes\n\nUpon the recording of a third strike against any lord, the Crown\nMarshall delivering the third demand shall simultaneously issue a Royal\nSummons requiring the lord to present himself before the Crown at Toledo\nwithin a timeframe determined by the marshall based upon the lord's\ncircumstances, distance from the capital, and any legitimate impediments\nto travel.\n\nPART II: THE ROYAL SUMMONS\n\nArticle 4: Nature of the Summons\n\nThe Royal Summons is not a punishment but an opportunity. The summoned\nlord shall appear before the King or his designated representative to\nexplain the circumstances of his non-compliance, present any evidence in\nhis defence, and negotiate a resolution to outstanding obligations.\n\nArticle 5: Timeframe and Escort\n\nThe Crown Marshall shall set a reasonable timeframe for appearance,\ntaking into account distance, weather, health, and other legitimate\nfactors. The marshall may, at his discretion, offer to accompany the\nlord to Toledo as a royal escort. This offer is both a courtesy and a\nmeans of ensuring compliance.\n\nArticle 6: Valid Excuses for Non-Appearance\n\nOnly an Act of God may excuse failure to appear within the appointed\ntimeframe. This includes severe illness certified by a physician,\nnatural disasters preventing travel, or other circumstances clearly\nbeyond human control. Mere inconvenience, pressing business, or personal\npreference shall not constitute valid excuse.\n\nArticle 7: Failure to Appear\n\nShould any lord fail to appear before the Crown within the appointed\ntimeframe without valid excuse, notification shall be sent\nimmediately to the King himself. Such failure shall be considered\nan act of rebellion against the Crown. The King reserves the right to\ndispatch military force to compel obedience and, if necessary, to strip\ntitles and privileges from the rebellious lord as an example to others.\n\nPART III: PROTECTION OF ASSESSORS\n\nArticle 8: The Tiered Escort System\n\nCrown assessors shall be provided with armed escort according to the\nfollowing tiers:\n\n  ---------------------- ------------------------ ------------------------\n  Assessment Type    Guards Required      Examples\n\n  Routine                None required            City merchants,\n                                                  cooperative minor\n                                                  landholders\n\n  Noble Estate (First    Two guards               Initial assessments at\n  Visit)                                          any noble estate\n\n  Difficult or Disputed  Four guards              Known troublesome lords,\n                                                  second/third visits\n                                                  after disputes, previous\n                                                  threats\n  ---------------------- ------------------------ ------------------------\n\nThe assessor shall have discretion to request escort based upon his\nknowledge of circumstances, and may request additional guards if\nconditions warrant.\n\nArticle 9: Purpose of Guards\n\nThe guards serve three purposes: first, to protect the physical safety\nof the assessor; second, to serve as witnesses to any threats,\nobstruction, or misconduct; third, to demonstrate that the Crown watches\nover its servants and takes their welfare seriously. The presence of\nroyal guards transforms any threat from a private matter into an offence\nagainst the Crown itself.\n\nArticle 10: Threats as Strikes\n\nAny threat or act of intimidation against an assessor, whether explicit\nor implicit, shall be recorded as a strike under Article 1(d) of this\nOrdinance. The marshall shall review the assessor's account, interview\nthe guards who were present, and determine whether the conduct warrants\nrecording. Implicit threats---such as displays of armed force,\nreferences to danger, or confinement of assessors---shall be treated\nwith the same gravity as explicit verbal threats.\n\nPART IV: EXPANSION OF CROWN SOLDIERS\n\nArticle 11: Authorized Strength\n\nThe Crown Soldiers shall be expanded from their present strength of one\nhundred fifty men to a total strength of two hundred men. This\nexpansion shall be accomplished through immediate recruitment of fifty\nadditional soldiers of proven character and martial skill.\n\nArticle 12: Garrison Rotation\n\nTo maintain morale and readiness, the duty of escorting assessors shall\nbe rotated among all four garrisons---Toledo, Segovia, Burgos, and\nValladolid. Each garrison shall take escort duty for a period of two\nmonths before returning to regular garrison duties while another\ngarrison assumes the responsibility. This rotation ensures that all\nsoldiers experience varied service and that no garrison grows stale from\nunchanging routine.\n\nArticle 13: Garrison Assignments\n\n  ----------------------- --------------- --------------------------------\n  Garrison            Strength    Primary Duties\n\n  Toledo (Alcázar)        50 men          Royal family, treasury,\n                                          archives, Cortes security\n\n  Segovia (Alcázar)       45 men          Secondary treasury, royal mint,\n                                          state prisoners\n\n  Burgos                  45 men          Northern gateway, royal\n                                          apartments, regional presence\n\n  Valladolid              40 men          Royal chancery archives, land\n                                          records\n\n  Reserve/Transit         20 men          Leave, recovery, escort\n                                          rotation, special duties\n  ----------------------- --------------- --------------------------------\n\nPART V: ITINERANT MARSHALLS\n\nArticle 14: Establishment\n\nThere shall be appointed three Itinerant Marshalls (Marescalli\nItinerantes), knights of exceptional virtue, wisdom, and judgment, who\nshall travel freely throughout the realms seeking out injustice,\ninvestigating complaints, and representing royal authority in places\nwhere regular marshalls cannot easily reach.\n\nArticle 15: Authority and Duties\n\nThe Itinerant Marshalls shall possess the same authority as regular\nCrown Marshalls, with the additional power to initiate investigations on\ntheir own initiative when they encounter evidence of wrongdoing. They\nshall not be assigned to fixed districts but shall move as duty\nrequires---one in the north, one in the south, one moving between the\neastern territories as circumstances demand.\n\nArticle 16: Qualifications\n\nCandidates for Itinerant Marshall must possess: knightly rank and proven\nmartial virtue; wisdom and sound judgment demonstrated through years of\nservice; the ability to work alone, far from support, for extended\nperiods; literacy in Latin and at least one vernacular tongue; and\nunimpeachable loyalty to the Crown and the Faith. The Military Orders of\nCalatrava, Santiago, and Alcántara, as well as the Dominican Order,\nshall be consulted for suitable candidates.\n\nArticle 17: Reporting\n\nThe Itinerant Marshalls shall report directly to the Crown. When they\nencounter matters requiring urgent attention, they shall send word\nimmediately to Toledo.

The campaign will join Polish and Hungarian\nallies in a coordinated offensive against the Ottoman Empire, with the\nstrategic objective of breaking Ottoman power in the Balkans and\nsecuring the approaches to Constantinople.\n\nThe plan introduces revolutionary tactical doctrine combining three\ninnovations that together invert every traditional Ottoman battlefield\nadvantage:\n\n1. Aggressive Artillery Deployment: Rapid positioning of superior\nCastilian guns to deny Ottomans time to construct fieldworks, forcing\nthem to attack prepared Christian positions rather than defending their\nown.\n\n2. War Wagon Fortress (Wagenburg): Hussite-style reinforced wagons\nforming a mobile defensive core that breaks cavalry charges and provides\nshelter for infantry and artillery crews.\n\n3. Pike Infantry Formations: Swiss-style disciplined pike blocks\nthat can hold against Janissary pressure while cavalry waits for the\ndecisive moment.\n\nPART II: EQUIPMENT PROGRAM\n\nA. Milanese Arms Procurement\n\nA Crown agent shall be dispatched to Milan this winter with authority to\ncontract for quality infantry equipment. The order emphasizes uniformity\nand craftsmanship over maximum quantity. All armor shall bear the Iota\nsymbol (Ι), marking it as Crown property.\n\n  ----------------------------------------- -----------------------------\n  Item                                  Cost (Florins)\n\n  7,000 infantry kits (brigandine, sallet,  98,000\n  sword, spear, dagger)                     \n\n  Shipping (Genoa to Cartagena/Seville)     10,000\n\n  Agent expenses, inspection, contingencies 7,000\n\n  SUBTOTAL: MILANESE ORDER                  115,000\n  ----------------------------------------- -----------------------------\n\nB. Domestic Production (Bilbao)\n\nMaster Heinrich Steinmann's consortium will produce approximately 800\nkits by autumn 1440, added to 1,700 currently in royal stores. Total\ndomestic contribution: 2,500 kits. Existing subsidy of 3,500 florins\nannually continues; no additional cost.\n\nC. Self-Equipped Men (Hombres de Armas Propias)\n\nMen who arrive at muster with their own acceptable equipment shall\nreceive an honor bonus and the title Hombre de Armas Propias (Man of\nHis Own Arms). This title shall be recorded in muster rolls and\nannounced publicly at the Toledo assembly.\n\n  ----------------------------------------- -----------------------------\n  Category                              Bonus (Florins)\n\n  Infantry with acceptable personal         5\n  equipment                                 \n\n  Cavalry with acceptable personal          10\n  equipment                                 \n  ----------------------------------------- -----------------------------\n\nEstimated 7,500 self-equipped men receiving bonuses: 45,000 florins\n\nD. Equipment Repair Stations\n\nMen whose personal equipment fails inspection but is repairable shall\nhave opportunity to improve their gear at Crown-funded repair stations.\nSmiths from Bilbao's trained apprentices shall staff these stations with\nportable forges and replacement parts.\n\n  ----------------------------------------- -----------------------------\n  Location                              Cost (Florins)\n\n  Toledo (main muster point)                3,000\n\n  Regional stations (Burgos, Seville,       2,000\n  Córdoba)                                  \n\n  SUBTOTAL: REPAIR PROGRAM                  5,000\n  ----------------------------------------- -----------------------------\n\nE. Equipment Possession Rules\n\nAll equipment issued from Crown stores bearing the Iota mark remains\nCrown property on permanent loan. Upon death, discharge, or desertion,\nequipment returns to royal armories. Sale of Iota-marked equipment\nconstitutes theft of Crown property.\n\nSelf-equipped men retain ownership of their personal arms. The honor\nbonus compensates their investment without creating resentment toward\nthose receiving Crown equipment.\n\nPART III: WAR WAGON PROGRAM\n\nA. Castilian Training Wagons\n\nFifty reinforced war wagons shall be constructed in Castile during\nwinter 1439-40 for training purposes during the 1440 muster.

Artillery positions at corners and along the perimeter.\nPike infantry deploys behind or beside the wagenburg, ready to advance\nor hold.\n\nFlanks: Field crossbowmen and rodeleros protect the pike formations'\nflanks. Light cavalry screens against Ottoman probing attacks.\n\nReserve: Heavy cavalry held behind the wagenburg, waiting for the\ndecisive moment when Ottoman forces are disordered by artillery and pike\nresistance.\n\nPART V: TRAINING PROGRAM (1440 MUSTER)\n\nA. Regional Muster Points\n\nEach regional muster point shall have war wagons and trained officers\npresent. Men shall begin familiarization with wagenburg formations\nimmediately upon arrival.\n\nB. Infantry Training Requirements\n\nPike Drill: Formation fighting with eighteen-foot pikes. Standing\nshoulder to shoulder. Lowering pikes in unison. Responding to horn and\ndrum signals. Trusting neighboring men to hold.\n\nWagenburg Training: Entering and exiting wagons. Reloading behind\nwagon boards. Defending gaps between linked wagons. Chain and hook\nhandling for linking and unlinking.\n\nCombined Arms: Artillery crews and infantry practicing together.\nDeployment timing. Communication between gun positions and infantry\nformations.\n\nC. Artillery Training\n\nCannon crews shall practice rapid deployment throughout 1440. Exercises\nshall test how quickly guns can be positioned and begin firing at marked\ntargets. Combined deployments with infantry shall establish coordination\ndoctrine.\n\nD. Cavalry Discipline (CRITICAL)\n\nOttoman tactics rely on feigned retreat to draw Christian cavalry away\nfrom infantry support. Castilian jinetes must be trained to resist this\ninstinct.\n\nSignal Drills: Horns, flags, and drums shall control cavalry\nmovement. No pursuit without explicit signal. Return signals shall be\npracticed until instinctive.\n\nTrap Exercises: Mock engagements where \"retreating\" forces are\nactually traps. Men who pursue without orders shall face harsh\nconsequences in training---flogging if necessary---rather than death in\nbattle.\n\nDiscipline Principle: Better to flog a dozen jinetes in training\nthan lose a thousand because they could not resist chasing a feigned\nretreat.\n\nE. March to Toledo\n\nAfter regional training, the entire army shall march to Toledo for final\nassembly. There, His Majesty shall review all forces, select the best\ntroops for the expedition, and conduct final combined exercises.\nEquipment inspection and upgrades shall be completed before selection.\n\nPART VI: ARTILLERY PRE-DEPLOYMENT\n\nAll artillery pieces intended for the Eastern campaign shall be shipped\nto Constantinople in autumn 1440. This ensures that when the main army\nsails in spring 1441, every ship carries fighting men rather than heavy\nguns.\n\nHeavy Bombards: 40--50 guns shipped autumn 1440\n\nField Pieces: 15--20 guns shipped autumn 1440\n\nPowder and Shot: Sufficient supplies for extended campaign, stored\nat Constantinople\n\nPART VII: COMPLETE FINANCIAL SUMMARY\n\n  --------------------------------------------- -------------------------\n  Program                                   Cost (Florins)\n\n  EQUIPMENT PROGRAM                         \n\n  Milanese Order (7,000 kits + shipping +       115,000\n  expenses)                                     \n\n  Self-Equipment Bonuses (\\~7,500 men)          45,000\n\n  Repair Stations (Toledo + regional)           5,000\n\n  Equipment Subtotal                            165,000\n\n  WAR WAGON PROGRAM                         \n\n  Castilian Training Wagons (50 wagons)         2,000\n\n  Eastern Theater Wagons (400 wagons,           20,000\n  estimated)                                    \n\n  Wagon Subtotal                                22,000\n\n  TRAINING AND PREPARATION                  \n\n  Hunyadi Officer Training Mission              2,000\n\n  Pike Procurement (thousands of 18-foot ash    4,000\n  shafts)                                       \n\n  1440 Muster Exercises (estimated, per 1438    45,000\n  model)                                        \n\n  Training Subtotal                             51,000\n\n  TOTAL PROGRAM COST                        238,000\n  --------------------------------------------- -------------------------\n\nTreasury Impact\n\nCurrent Treasury (November 1439): 1,350,738 florins\n\nProgram Cost: 238,000 florins\n\nPercentage of Treasury: 17.6%\n\nAssessment: Sustainable.

It combines proven innovations---Hussite wagon\ntactics, Swiss pike discipline, and Castilian artillery\nsuperiority---into a doctrine designed specifically to defeat Ottoman\nbattlefield advantages. The cost is substantial but sustainable. The\ntraining is demanding but achievable. The objective is nothing less than\nbreaking Ottoman power in the Balkans and securing Christendom's eastern\nfrontier.\n\nBy the grace of God and the discipline of Christian arms, we shall\nprevail.\n\nPrepared by:\n\nDiego de Daza, Chief Administrator\n\nSir Thomas Beaumont, Commander, Royal Military Academy\n\nCaptain Fernán de Vargas, Tactical Advisor\n\nApproved by:\n\nJuan II, King of Castile, León, Aragon, Naples, and Sicily, Defensor\nRomaniae",
