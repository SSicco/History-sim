Byzantine servants bowed as he passed, their faces carefully blank. He had almost reached his chambers when he noticed the first sign. A knot of men in the courtyard below—visible through a window overlooking the interior gardens. Dark robes. The Patriarch's household, by their dress. They moved with purpose toward the private wing of the palace, led by a younger priest who walked quickly, a sealed letter clutched in his hand. The Patriarch had left the first council in anger. Now his messengers were returning to the palace."

Catalina played with a wooden horse that some Byzantine servant had found for her, making it gallop across the table while her nursemaid tried to interest her in food. Before Juan could answer, a commotion in the corridor outside. Raised voices—Greek, too fast for Juan to follow, but the tone was unmistakable. Argument. Then silence, and the sound of boots moving away quickly. A servant entered moments later with wine. His hands trembled slightly as he poured."

Constantinople spread below him—dark shapes of domes and towers, scattered lights, the distant gleam of the Golden Horn under a half-moon. Movement caught his eye. A procession of torches moving through the streets below the palace walls. Twelve, perhaps fifteen men on horseback, riding toward the Blachernae gate. The lead rider carried a banner Juan could not make out in the darkness, but the size of the escort spoke of wealth. Of importance. The hoofbeats faded. Somewhere in the palace, a door slammed."

Through the gap, he could see two Byzantine servants speaking with one of his own men—a Castilian sergeant who had been posted as guard. The sergeant's face was troubled."

The messenger who brought it was not the same young functionary who had attended them before. This one was older, his face carved from stone, his bow precisely correct and entirely without warmth. Outside the council chamber, two men stood waiting. Juan recognized neither, but their dress marked them as nobility. They studied him as he approached, murmured something to each other in Greek, and did not bow. The doors opened."

And at the far end of the table, relaxed, well-dressed, watching with the faint smile of a man who has won a hand at cards— Loukas Notaras. The Megas Doux inclined his head slightly."

Central in the planning has been that we are not making demands, but we rather are presenting a choice. A choice that will allow the empire to drive the muslims from the lands and unite with our christian brothers of the latin tradition. Like I told you yesterday, the religeous aspects will remain as they are. There are latin and orthodox traditions and they will exist in peace beside one another. Like brothers and sisters living in peace together. A great way to improve the population, trade and alliances of the city will be to let latins own and live in the city itself. This will boost the revenue and trade, but also will increase the population greatly. The city needs this economic impulse. Taxes will be extracted by crown appointed servants and will flow directy to the treasury. We re-institute the ancient noble obligation that all nobles must fight under the crown when called. Since not only the city of Constantinople can win this war, we need the aid of christian kingdoms as well. I will secure the kingdoms of Naples, Aragon and Castille under my rule. The best way to make this alliance iron-clad is to declare empire and include Constantinople in this as well. Emperor John is considering if this is in his best interest and in the interest of his family and his legacy. But it is a powerful weapon should we choose to include it. We present this plan to the Byzantine people and if they choose to accept it, they also accept my command. A choice. My offer of refuge in my kingdom stands, as do my gifts. Should the Byzantine people choose not to have me lead the defence, then I will simply sail away and will keep you in my prayers. So, that is what was discussed yesterday."

Your emperor has asked me for help in these times and I foresee three futures for the city. The first choice is to relocate the city. I offer refuge for those willing to come and will fully respect both your culture and religion. The city will fall to the turks, but at least you are safe in a place where you can keep your religion alive. The second choice is to let me lead the fight against the Ottomans. I will bring the sword of christianity down on the turks and will drive them from the continent. I can only do this if you as well commit to this fight. If we fight then we fight with everything we have and with everyone. I will implement the ancient noble obligations again and we turn our full attention to not only survive but to restore the city to it's glory. Latins will be allowed to own property, giving the city some much needed work and population. We need to grow is we need to win. I will bring thousands of christian soldiers to this fight. If we win, latin christians and orthodox christians will live side by side as brothers under the rule of an orthodox king. I fully realize that I ask you to place your trust in me and that latin kings have betrayed you before. Therefore, I ask you not to choose today, but to rather think about it and make the choice later, after a few years when you have had time to think about it. The third choice is what happens when the city rejects the other choices. I will have repaired your walls and I will leave back to Iberia. I will not help those who do not want help. The past few days, I have spent speaking with those who will make this choice. And it only seemed proper to inform the citizens as well. And to enjoy this old location again. It is overdue some good use. We will have some races later. But first, let's discuss what the city should do."
