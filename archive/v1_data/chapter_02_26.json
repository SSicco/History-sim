Some eighty of Notaras's guards marched out at midmorning, disarmed and heading to their former master's estate. Most of the palace servants remain, nervous and uncertain, watching to see which way the wind truly blows."

Yesterday we were preparing for the inevitable day when Ottomans would break through our walls and finally take from us whatever is left of our empire. Yesterday, we feared each other. We were afraid to lose what little we had left. Today, we turn the page. Today, we decide that we shall be afraid no more! That from this day forward we shall not go quietly into the night! We shall not vanish without a fight. Today is a new dawn for the empire. No longer will we lose ground to the muslims, but we start taking it back. Long has the Byzantine empire been asking the west for aid. And for a long time, we have been wondering what that aid would even look like. Now we know. The only way forward is when Greeks and Latins work together, when we no longer fear each other and hide behind walls. We are christians and it's time we remembered that. And you have, when you named me defensor. Defensor...a name chosen carefully. I am not here to dominate, or to conquer. No. I am here to reclaim, to protect. Why do we fight? Not because of greed, no. We fight to free our brothers and sisters from the yoke of the true opressors, the sultan and his janissaries. How many times do mothers have to clutch their sons to their chests, in fear of the dreaded blood tax? How much longer do we have to face our own kin in battle who have been stripped of their identity, their culture and their faith? How cruel can one be to twist young boys so? No! I will not stand for it. We will not stand for it. I will always place myself between any mother and this evil and say 'Not today!' For I am not just a general, a soldier, a father. I am Defensor Romaniae and I will protect and defend. Today under this sun begins the Reclaiming, the Apokatastasis. Everyone fights. And if we all put our strength into it, then we will reclaim that what was lost. We will mend that was broken. We will make the lord smile as he looks down upon us and he will se his name honoured and his praises sung. An empire worth fighting for and a future worth dying for. To Victory!"

Smiths know metal but not how to use it against a man trying to kill them. But they have fire. That counts for something. Fire can be shaped, if the shapers know their work. For trainers, Defensor, we have several options. First: my own Tagmata officers. Professional soldiers, Byzantine-born, Greek-speaking. They know how to train men for wall defense—that is what they do. But they are few, and they are needed for palace security. I can spare perhaps five men for training duty without compromising our position. Second: the wall garrison veterans. Kantakouzenos has men who have stood on those walls for twenty years. They know siege defense better than anyone alive. Some are too old for front-line duty but would make excellent drill instructors. The Strategos could identify a dozen such men, perhaps more. Third: the noble household guards. The committed houses—Philanthropenos, Doukas, Tornikes—they have men who know how to fight. Not all are needed for their lords' immediate service. A rotation could be arranged—each house contributing one or two experienced soldiers to the training cadre. Fourth: your Castilians. They know infantry tactics—real tactics, tested against the Moors. Your tercios broke Granada. If you could spare officers to teach formation fighting, close-quarters combat, the discipline that holds a line when men are dying around you... My recommendation is a combination. Byzantine officers for basic drill, wall defense, and discipline—they speak the language, they understand the men, they can earn trust quickly. Castilian officers for combat tactics—formation fighting, coordinated maneuvers, the things that turn a militia into an army that can take the field, not just hold walls. There is one other matter, Defensor. The Taktikon specifies forty days of basic training. These men have trades, families, obligations. Forty consecutive days away from their work means forty days without income. Some will struggle to feed their families during training. The military treasury can provide basic rations during training—the Taktikon allows for this. But if we want these men to train well, without distraction, without worry about hungry children at home... we may need to provide more. A small stipend, perhaps. Enough to replace lost wages. It is an investment, Defensor. Two hundred men now could become two thousand if word spreads that the themata treats its soldiers fairly. Or it could collapse if these first volunteers return to their quarters complaining of empty bellies and broken promises."

Common laborers: Three hyperpyra per day, forty days—that is one hundred twenty hyperpyra. Skilled craftsmen: Five hyperpyra per day, forty days—that is two hundred hyperpyra.

Thirty thousand hyperpyra. Or approximately two thousand to twenty-five hundred florins.

The proposal divides the council—the Emperor sees potential in Juan's unique position, while Kantakouzenos warns of the extreme risk of placing their defender in Ottoman hands."
