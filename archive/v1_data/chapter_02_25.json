Servants have arranged benches in a rough semicircle around a table spread with maps—Nikephoros's maps, the ones showing every lost city and title from Thessalonica to Nicaea. They came. Not all of them, but enough. Philanthropenos stands near the door, greeting arrivals with the quiet authority of a man who has gambled everything on this meeting. His grandsons flank him. Kantakouzenos arrived early and claimed a seat near the window, watching the courtyard below—watching, no doubt, for any sign of Notaras's men. The families filter in over the next hour. The Asanes send their patriarch, a white-bearded man who walks with a cane and studies the maps with hungry eyes—his family's name is written beside Mesembria. The Raoul contingent arrives in force: three brothers, all soldiers, all wearing swords despite the supposed peace of a council. One of the Melissenos cousins sits across from them, and neither party acknowledges the other. The Laskaris representative is young—a grandson of a grandson, his claim to Nicaea so distant that most have forgotten it exists. But he came. The Bryennios family sends a single man who sits in the back, arms crossed, face unreadable. And then there are others: minor houses, cadet branches, men whose grandfathers held kephalates that no longer exist. They crowd the benches, lean against walls, peer over shoulders at the catalogue of everything their families lost. Notaras has not come. Neither has the Emperor. Neither has the Patriarch. But their absence speaks."

          "text": "A fair question and I am glad you ask. Most of it is codified in the documents that support the decree of the choice, but I will happily restate my strategy. First, we must secure the city of Constantinople. This is our base of operation, our axis and anchor. We allow latins to own property in the city and we establish the mercantile courts to let trade give the economic and population boom the city needs. The city has been reducing in number every year. We must turn this around. We start building up our strength, we repair the walls, place cannons and eliminate the threat of immediate attack by the Ottomans. Then we can start planning our offence. I command a lot of forces and will gradually deploy them in this area. This will require the construction of transport fleets but with the fleets of Castille, Aragon and Naples combined in alliance, we can do this. I will come through Hungary in the beginning, weakening the Ottomans and retaking their lands is in their best interest. I have a military academy that studies Ottoman tactics and my officers will deploy these tactics and lessons in battle against them. I command personally the military orders numbering 5000 men and Castille fields 45.000 men in the field. History teaches us that with proper motivation, a crusade can field many times that number. My family controls many crowns of lands that were once part of a great empire and I will forge an alliance against the Ottomans that includes these kingdoms. We are restoring Roman glory so let the kingdoms from Naples to Iberia join in the fight as well. But I must also be honest. I cannot lay out an exact battle of campaign plan yet for re-conquest. Too much is yet unknown for we must first build up our own strength, make the city ready to receive and house an army that can face the Ottomans in the field. But I do know that the kingdoms that I command right now. The crowns of Leon and Castille. Combined with the crowns I am heir to - the crowns of Aragon and Naples. I directly command crowns to challenge the Ottomans. Add to that Constantinople that is not reducing in population and trade, but is becoming strong again. Combine that with a strong naval alliance with either Venice or Genoa. Add to that the knowledge that crusades can field armies in support. Add to that an alliance with Hungary and Poland who are waiting for years for a chance to take the fight to the Ottomans. Add the holy orders the church command and can commit to this fight. While none of this is set in stone yet, it is an array of forces so formidable we need not to have all to have such an advantage against the Ottomans that victory does not seem far-fetched to me."

It always does. The Latins promise great crusades. They march east with banners flying. And then they die in Ottoman mud while Constantinople burns. You want honesty, Defensor? I will give you honesty. My grandfather fought at the walls in 1204. Not against Turks. Against Latins. Against crusaders who came to help us. They burned the greatest library in Christendom. They melted down a thousand years of bronze and gold. They raped nuns in the Hagia Sophia and put a whore on the Patriarch's throne."

The shaded pavilion near the imperial box is comfortable, as promised. Cushions, a small table with wine and water, gauze curtains that filter the sun while allowing a clear view of the track.

She settles against his chest, one small hand gripping the fabric of his doublet, her dark eyes wide. Below, the stands fill. The Asanes patriarch is helped to his seat in the secondary imperial box, his grandsons flanking him. The Bryennioi arrive in force—the uncle himself, the observer who is now a judge, cousins and retainers. They are seen. They mean to be seen. Philanthropenos sits with Kantakouzenos, two soldiers watching the crowd with professional eyes. The committed houses display their colors openly. The uncommitted sit further back, watching, calculating. The Emperor's seat of honor remains empty. But a court official—a minor functionary in imperial livery—sits two rows behind it. Observing. Reporting. The Italians cluster in their own section: Venetians on one side, Genoese on the other, a careful gap between them. But they are here. Together. In a Greek arena. And everywhere, the common people of Constantinople. Thousands of them. More than came to the first races. Word has spread."

Venetians against Genoese. We keep the course wide. For safety. Third heat: mixed. One Greek team, one Italian, one Castilian. This is... new. There was much discussion about whether it was appropriate. I decided it was appropriate. Between the heats: mounted demonstrations. Your Castilian knights will show horsemanship—the exercises they practice for war. Riding at rings, sword work from horseback, formation drills. The Greeks are curious about Western cavalry tactics. Let them see. After the races: a melee. Blunted weapons, no killing, first man unhorsed or disarmed loses. Greeks, Italians, Castilians, all mixed together. Eight men. The winner receives a purse of fifty florins and a silver cup. There was a request—from some of the younger Greek nobles—for a joust. Proper tilting, with lances. I told them this is not a Greek tradition, but they insisted they wished to try. If you permit, we could add it at the end. Informal. A demonstration, not a competition."

Each represents a district of Constantinople—not the old Blues and Greens of the faction riots, but neighborhoods: Blachernae, Phanar, Kontoskalion, and the harbor district near the Golden Gate. The horses are not the magnificent beasts of the old chronicles; they are sturdy, practical animals, the best the diminished city can muster. But their riders sit straight, and the ribbons on their harnesses catch the morning light. Theodoros raises a white cloth. The crowd falls quiet. The cloth drops. The horses surge forward, hooves thundering on the ancient track. The crowd rises to its feet. Lucia leans forward. Catalina shrieks with delight at the noise and motion, clapping her small hands. The Blachernae rider takes an early lead—a young man on a chestnut mare, riding low and fast. The Phanar team presses close behind. Kontoskalion and Golden Gate fall back, fighting for third. Then, on the second turn, the Blachernae mare stumbles. A gasp ripples through the crowd. The rider nearly falls, catches himself, loses three lengths. The Phanar horse surges past, then Kontoskalion. The young man from Blachernae is suddenly last, his mare limping slightly, the race seemingly lost. But he does not stop. He speaks to the horse—those nearby swear they can see his lips moving—and something changes. The mare steadies. Her stride evens. And slowly, impossibly, she begins to gain ground. The crowd notices. Murmurs become shouts. By the third turn, Blachernae has passed Golden Gate. By the fourth, Kontoskalion. The Phanar rider glances back, sees death coming, and whips his horse frantically. It is not enough. The chestnut mare crosses the finish line half a length ahead, her rider's face streaked with dust and tears. He slides from her back and embraces her neck, and the horse—as if she knows what she has done—stands perfectly still. The Hippodrome erupts. Not faction against faction. Not district against district. Simply thousands of people who have just witnessed something they will tell their grandchildren about: the day the lame horse won. The Asanes patriarch is on his feet, pounding his cane against the stone. The Bryennioi are applauding. Somewhere in the common stands, a chant begins—the rider's name, repeated over and over: 'Stavros! Stavros! Stavros!'"

I will send word to the church wardens to expect us in the afternoon, after the midday offices have concluded. A private visit. You, your wife, your daughter. Myself and a few attendants. We will enter through the imperial door, as is my right. You will see the church as few Latins have seen it since... Since before.
