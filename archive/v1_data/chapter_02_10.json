Toledo's summer heat had softened into evening warmth, the thick stone walls of the Alcázar finally releasing the day's accumulated weight. Servants moved quietly through corridors, lighting candles and opening casements to admit what breeze might stir from the river below. The walk to the royal chambers took only moments—the route memorized from years of habit—yet felt unfamiliar after so many months abroad. Different tapestries hung in the corridor. A bust he didn't recognize. Some functionary had been making improvements in his absence."

The Queen expected him. The chamber was lit by candles clustered on the window ledge, their flames dancing in the faint breeze. Isabel sat at her dressing table, Doña Beatriz having just finished braiding her hair for the night. The Portuguese lady-in-waiting looked up as Juan entered, curtsied smoothly, and withdrew without a word—closing the door softly behind her."

Her lips are slightly parted, and in the candlelight Juan can see the tiny rise and fall of her chest beneath the light blanket. Seventeen months old. Walking now. Speaking a few words. Pa.

His daughter is on the floor near the foot of the bed, engaged in serious negotiations with a wooden horse that has seen better days. She holds it by one leg and appears to be explaining something to it with great conviction in a language composed entirely of sounds that are not quite words. She looks up when the door opens. Her face transforms—eyes widening, mouth opening into a perfect circle of surprise and delight. She drops the horse immediately and begins the laborious process of getting to her feet, arms windmilling for balance."

The men there do not know me. They must see Your Majesty's authority, not merely hear my claim to it. Second: communication. Messages from Constantinople to Castile will travel slowly—weeks at best, months if weather or war disrupts the routes. I propose establishing a relay through Venice or Genoa. Merchants travel those routes regularly. A letter entrusted to the right trading house can move faster than any courier we send alone. With Your Majesty's permission, I will arrange this and send word of which merchant houses to trust with return correspondence. Third: diplomatic authority. When I stand before the Greek Emperor, what may I promise on Your Majesty's behalf? I understand the sixty thousand florins and the three hundred knights are committed. But if Emperor John asks for more—more men, more gold, a formal alliance—what am I permitted to say? I do not wish to overpromise and shame Castile. Nor do I wish to seem cold and lose Greek confidence. Clear boundaries will help me navigate whatever I find there. Answer these three questions, and I will have everything I need.

In Granada, we fought with our backs to Castile. Supply lines measured in days. Reinforcement always possible. In Morocco... In Morocco, we fight with our backs to the sea.

He administers the city, handles the population, maintains order. And we... We establish outposts nearby. Fortified positions. Not to rule, but to protect. To ensure that when the Sultan of Fez or some tribal confederation comes to punish this vassal for his submission to a Christian king, he finds Castilian steel between him and his target. It is clever. I will grant that. It addresses the core problem—administration and supply. A Muslim vassal rules Muslims. He knows the language, the customs, the politics.

They preserve and transmit what is already known. They do not—discover. They do not ask 'why does gunpowder burn' and then seek the answer through experiment. This would be something new.

Rome has not always welcomed those who look beyond accepted doctrine. Galileo's predecessors have faced... difficulties. I do not say this to dissuade Your Majesty. I say it so we may prepare for the obstacles. If we are to build a place of Christian discovery, we must do so carefully. Frame it correctly.

Catalina follows it with the intense, wobbling determination that characterizes all her pursuits, arms outstretched as if she might catch it through sheer desire."
