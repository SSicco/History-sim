And if we adapt and train enough, and when enough sweat and blood has been spilled we may yet be deserving of victory. Victory seems so long away. We stand in the ruins of the hippodrome. A location that was once great. We are in a city that has been hollowed out, a city that was once the jewel of the world. We do not shy away from what is in front of us for it is the plain truth for it does not help us. Instead, we are here to show the Byzantines and the world that the light has not gone out in the east. That christians remember their brotherhood, even after being apart for centuries.

Help to fight a fight you cannot win on your own. If the answer is that this is indeed the case, then I will take charge of the defence. That means no more hiding behind privilege and ancient agreement. Agreements that will be lost anyway when the city falls to the sultan. Whatever is left of the Byzantine empire will become part of the alliance between Aragon, Naples, Castille and Portugal. Only then will we be able to turn the tide. We in Iberia know what it is like to fight a reconquista and can teach you how to do the same. But if we are to bleed for someone else, we will only do so on our terms. So it means giving up pride and authority to let me lead the defence. I know that this is a difficult choice, but I want you to understand that this is not a demand at all. I offer you whatever I can give without asking for anything else in return. And consider the situation from our perspective and hopefully you and the others can see that I am sincere in what I offer.

I shall provide shelter and refuge for the Byzantines in my kingdom. There you can live in peace and preserve your religion and culture. But it means leaving Constantinople. If you do not want that, I leave my gifts behind and sail away so the empire can sail its own course and maybe be absorbed by the Muslims. Tonight we are planning for the third option. An option that asks tremendous sacrifice both in blood and in pride. It is an option, mind you. Not a demand, rather a choice the Byzantine people should make. A choice with alternatives, for a choice without an alternative is no choice at all. I say this because I know that what I am about to plan for, may sound outlandish, maybe even insulting to the proud and prestigious people of the empire. I remind you again that we are planning for a choice, that this is not a demand. That I require authority not for personal gain or glory, but to unite everyone under one banner, one purpose. There simply is no time, space or room anymore for the old ways. We adapt or we die among ancient tradition. Now, firstly, Religion. Whatever will be discussed, the matter of the Filioque will not be. Now is not the time of religious reform or mending of the schism. That may come later if it will come at all. But I require nothing from the church except for the support both in holy service as in monetary terms as we all will have to pay. Secondly. I am in command. Me and only me. I will lead not just the defense of Constantinople, I will also have to lead the crowns of Naples, Aragon, Castile and Portugal in this fight and negotiate alliances with other christian kingdoms such as Hungary, Poland and the holy Roman empire. I have led a reconquista before and will do so again. Part of the choice is if the Byzantine people trust me with the leadership. Remember, I am not demanding, it is a choice. Thirdly, I will require you to fight like devils. No more hiding behind walls, titles or privilege. Christianity fights for your empire, and you will fight the hardest of all. I will militarize the nobility and arm every citizen. Trade, the church and science will be geared towards warfare. Everyone fights. Tonight we will draft proposals that detail in more specific terms what I have just laid out. So we can present this choice to the empire. After it has been presented, I will wait and will let you make a choice awaiting whatever you decide. You have been summoned to help me and the emperor in doing just this.

They held vast lands, vast wealth. They became powers unto themselves—until kings and popes destroyed them for that very reason. You propose to create such orders for the Orthodox church. In months, not centuries. Without papal authority to bind them. Without lands to sustain them. And you expect the monasteries—who have guarded their independence for a thousand years—to simply... transform themselves into soldiers? I do not say it is impossible. I say I do not understand how you imagine it would work. The monks of Mount Athos would sooner burn their monasteries than take up swords. The Patriarch would excommunicate any priest who blessed such an order without his sanction. You speak of everyone fighting. But the Church fights with prayer, with teaching, with the preservation of sacred truth. If you wish to change that—if you wish Orthodox monks to become Latin-style warrior orders—you must explain how. And you must explain who would lead them, fund them, command them."

          "text": "Gennadios, yes yes, very good. But again, do not twist my words. I said TAKE INSPIRATION from the Latin church. Not copy it. You are here exactly because we need to figure out what this would look like in the Orthodox tradition. Otherwise I could ask any of my Catholic priests instead. Tonight we will ask ourselves: 'If the Orthodox church would turn every effort into winning this war, what would that look like?' Can you help us answer that question Gennadios? And regarding the soldiers we do not have: Yes, I cannot snap my fingers and summon the Polish king into this room. We do not know what moves them. We hope to invite them into an alliance and attack the Ottomans together. That is why the structure we set up is so important. If I meet with them, I have the authority to bind the entire alliance. And that there is a structure that fighting the Ottomans actually is rewarded. The structure would be something like this: The kingdoms of Naples, Aragon, Castile and perhaps Portugal enter into a strong alliance of crowns. My family sits on these thrones so I hold much direct control over them already. Any lands taken from the Ottomans will be distributed using the crusade system. The reconquista, a concept familiar to the Iberians. The Poles and the Hungarians already border the Ottomans. I think it will not take much to convince them to attack with us. But only if we are serious about attacking them and the Ottomans are seriously occupied. That is why the structure is so important. If we attack them from all sides, Hungary and Poland gain lands and they press forward and what was once Greek lands will be reconquered. We may yet lose. We may yet be defeated. But if we have a good plan and the Byzantines choose to fight, I think we should."

They could tithe for war. They have done so before, in centuries past, when emperors demanded it. The Patriarch would resist, but if the people believed the cause was holy... The monks will not become knights. That is not our tradition. But they could support knights. Pray for them. Bless them. Tend their wounded. Copy their letters. Preserve their names for history. The monasteries were fortresses once, in darker times. Some still have walls. They could shelter refugees, store supplies, serve as waypoints. And there is this: we have priests who fight. Not officially. Not with the Patriarch's blessing. But village priests who took up swords against raiders. Monks who died on the walls in sieges past. The tradition exists, even if we do not speak of it. If you want the Orthodox church to fight—truly fight—you do not create military orders. You create a holy cause. A crusade in all but name. You have the Emperor proclaim that the defense of Constantinople is sacred duty. You have priests preach it from every pulpit. You have monks process through the streets with icons and relics, blessing the soldiers, cursing the enemy. The Patriarch would hate it. But if the people believed... the Patriarch would have to follow or be swept aside."

If Hungary strikes while we hold the straits, if Poland threatens their northern vassals... But timing is everything. If we attack before the others are ready, we die alone. If they attack before we are ready, they die alone. How do you coordinate armies separated by a thousand miles? How do you ensure the Hungarians do not make peace the moment they have taken what they want? I have seen alliances. They promise much. They deliver little. Each king thinks first of his own lands, his own glory. What makes this different? What binds them?"

If the Ottomans are challenged near Constantinople, soon, the kings of Poland and Hungary will see that the lands bordering them will be easy prey. It requires us to take up the sword first and they will not move until they have seen us match the Turks in the field and will. But once we have, they will not be able to defend their northern border. Greed is a powerful ally. But we will have to stand on our own first, I have no doubt about it. That is why our plan is so important. We build up our strength, and sooner or later, others will descend on them as well."

If we truly threatened them, there would be enough for everyone. Hungary wants Serbia back. Poland eyes the Black Sea coast. Venice wants its trading posts secure. Genoa... Genoa wants whatever Venice does not have. You say we must prove ourselves first. Match them in the field. With what we have now—your thousand, my few thousand, the walls—we cannot meet them in open battle. We would be slaughtered. But. If we hold. If we bleed them at the walls. If we make the price too high... Murad is not a fool. He will not spend fifty thousand men to take a city he could starve into submission. If we show him that Constantinople will cost more than it is worth—that is how we buy time. Time for your alliances to form. Time for greed to do its work."

I begin to see the shape of it. First—a proclamation. The Emperor declares the defense of Constantinople sacred duty. Not union with Rome. Not submission. Simply: this is holy work. Second—the monasteries tithe. Not their lands. Not their independence. But gold. Grain. Medicine. Whatever they can spare. Those who refuse... We shame them. Publicly. Let the people see who hoards while soldiers die. Third—processions. Icons. Relics carried through the streets. The Virgin of Blachernae—she has saved this city before. The people must believe this fight is blessed. I cannot promise the Patriarch's support. But I can promise this: if the people believe, the Patriarch will follow. He is old. He fears being left behind more than he fears the Latins."

Juan's strategy of leveraging greed to bind allies is acknowledged as realistic. The session concludes with plans to continue developing the framework with nobles, guilds, and commoners."
