What we lack is material. The treasury cannot afford to purchase ore at Venetian prices, and what little we had has gone to church bells and desperate repairs. Cannons change sieges. The Turks know this—they have been experimenting, building larger and larger bombards. If we had our own, mounted on the walls, we could break their siege engines before they reach us.

They will convince themselves that the threat is not imminent, that something will change, that God will provide a miracle that does not require them to swallow their pride. The decree will be signed, if it is signed at all, when Turkish campfires are visible from the walls. When the first stones strike the gates. When it is almost too late. That is why your system of swift response matters so much. We will not have months of warning. We will have weeks. Days, perhaps. But you have given me something I have not had in years.

I have served him for eleven years. He is not a bad man. Not a weak man, not truly. But he has been Emperor of a dying Empire his entire reign. Every year, less territory. Every year, fewer soldiers. Every year, more humiliations. It has... curdled something in him. Made him suspicious of strength, because strength reminds him of his own weakness. My counsel? Yes, approach him. But not alone. Not publicly. And not asking permission—offering consultation. 'Your Imperial Majesty, I intend to send bronze ore to aid in the city's defense.

The Ottomans rule from Adrianople now. They call it Edirne. The Black Sea coast. Mesembria. Anchialos. Sozopolis. These fell in my grandfather's time, but the titles remain—empty honors held by families who remember when they meant something. And beyond—though this was longer ago—Anatolia. Nicaea, where the Creed was written. Nicomedia. Prusa—which the Turks call Bursa and have made their holy city. Philadelphia held out until 1390, the last Christian city in Asia Minor.

Distribute Thessalonica, Thrace, Macedonia, the Black Sea coast. Give us back what was taken. Some families will claim ancestral rights. Others will compete for what has no clear heir.

Third: Doux of the Fleet — The Megas Doux. This one still exists in theory—Loukas Notaras holds it. Though what fleet he commands is a question worth asking. A dozen galleys, perhaps. Once it meant hundreds of ships. Fourth: Doux of Mesembria — The Black Sea coast. Lost in 1396. Key to the grain trade from Crimea.

Subordinate titles within the Duchy: Kephale of Thessalonica — Civil governor of the city itself. Responsible for markets, walls, and urban administration. Strategos of the Macedonian Theme — Field commander of the provincial army. Subordinate to the Doux but commanding troops in the field. Prokathemenos of the Harbor — Master of the port. Controlled customs, anchorage fees, naval supplies. Archon of the Lower City — Administrator of the commercial districts and foreign quarters. Kephale of Berroia — Governor of the inland city, second largest in Macedonia. Key position on the western road. Kephale of Edessa — Ancient city north of Thessalonica. Controlled mountain passes toward Serbia. Kephale of Rentina — Fortress town guarding the eastern approaches. Prokathemenos of the Axios Valley — Administrator of the rich agricultural lands along the river. Archon of Kalamaria — Lord of the coastal district east of the city. Kephale of Hierissos — Guardian of the approaches to Mount Athos. Prostates of Mount Athos — Imperial representative to the Holy Mountain. A position of spiritual prestige rather than military power, but significant nonetheless. Noble estates of note: The Metochion of the Philanthropenos — Our family held lands near Berroia for two centuries. The Palaiologos estates along the Axios. The Kantakouzenos properties near Rentina. The Tarchaniotes holdings in Kalamaria. Adrianople and Thrace: Doux of Adrianople — Military governor of Thrace. Commands the heartland between Constantinople and the Danube. Lost 1369. The Kantakouzenos family claims this title in exile. Subordinate titles within the Duchy: Kephale of Adrianople — Civil governor of the city. Now the Ottoman capital; they call it Edirne. Strategos of the Thracian Theme — Field commander. Once one of the most important military posts in the Empire. Kephale of Didymoteichon — Governor of the fortress city on the Maritsa River. Lost 1361. Once an imperial residence. Kephale of Tzurulum — Modern Çorlu. Controls the road from Constantinople to Adrianople. Kephale of Arcadiopolis — Lost 1365. Strategic junction town. Kephale of Bizye — Northern Thracian fortress. Lost 1373. Prokathemenos of the Ergene Valley — Rich agricultural lands, now Turkish. Archon of Mesene — Coastal district along the Marmara shore. Kephale of Selymbria — This one we still hold, barely. Twenty miles from Constantinople. Often raided. Kephale of Herakleia — On the Marmara coast. Technically ours; practically contested. Kephale of Raidestos — Lost 1354. Important port on the Marmara. Noble estates of note: The Palaiologos ancestral lands near Didymoteichon."

If we simply invite 'the nobles of Constantinople,' half will refuse out of fear of Notaras, and the other half will come only to spy and report back to him. We must be strategic. First—the claimants. Those families who hold documents to lost titles. The Kantakouzenoi for Adrianople. The Asanes for Mesembria. The Raoul and Melissenos for the Serres region. The Laskaris for whatever Anatolian dreams they still cherish. These families have reason to come. Second—the military families who committed today. Third—the waverers. The Bryennios, who sent their scholar but held back from commitment. Fourth—and this is delicate—we must decide what to do about houses aligned with Notaras."

You act as Defensor, but the decree naming you Defensor has not been signed. My counsel: hold the meeting, but frame it carefully. This is not a distribution of titles—it is a consultation. You make no final grants tonight. You listen, you record, you promise nothing beyond 'your claim is noted and will be honored if we succeed.' Except, of course, for those of us who have already committed. Our grants are... more concrete."
