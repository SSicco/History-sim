And this time, one will be elected by a Council that claims supreme authority, the other will be the sitting pontiff who claims councils cannot depose him. Christendom will split. Every kingdom, every diocese, every monastery will have to choose: Basel's pope or Rome's pope. Another schism, Your Majesty. Perhaps worse than the last."

And what do you propose for the decrees the Council has already passed?"

The reason we are in this mess is because people conflate right procedure to enact reform. The church desperately needs reform.

I have 800 crusaders here in Basel and most of them in Rome at the moment. They have been released from their crusader's vow and cannot command them into another crusade or war immediately, but I can ask them if they want to join me into a new war against the Ottomans. In Castile, I command about 5,000 soldiers from three orders who can set sail immediately should this be required. I have entered into an alliance with Aragon who will soon secure Naples. This gives me naval bases and a large fleet. I must confer with them but I have every expectation they will commit. I have founded an academy of Christian military commanders to come up with new tactics to fight the Ottomans. They have already educated officers and can provide doctrine for the army facing the Ottomans in the field. I myself will lead from the front like I did in Granada. I will not ask a man to do something I am not willing to do myself. I have faith that I can rally more kingdoms to come to your aid, especially when there is hope for victory. Hungary and Poland seemed eager to help. A brother in need...you do not ask what he offers you in return when he is about to drown. You just help. I have but one request. My wife is with child and I have made a promise to be by her side during childbirth. A promise I cannot break. You speak plainly, so I will do so as well.

He might withdraw, regroup, wait for better opportunity. But if you mean 'can the Byzantine Empire return to its former strength'—no. That empire is gone.

But a permanent military order? Knights who hold lands in Constantinople, who answer to their Order's Master rather than the Emperor, who maintain Latin rites in an Orthodox city? This is... complicated. We remember the Latin Empire. When the Fourth Crusade conquered us, they established a Latin Patriarch. Latin knights held Greek lands.

Can Castile commit to such a war? Can any Western power? You speak of tens of thousands of troops, years of campaigning, fortunes spent. Emperor Sigismund tried and failed.

It buys us time for you, for the Byzantine Empire, to make a choice. A choice about their future. The first choice is keep doing what we are doing right now. I support you and we delay the inevitable. We fight and die honourably in the defence of Christendom in the east. There is honour and simplicity in this, but the Empire would simply end. If we want to prevent this, far far more is needed. The second choice is migration. I offer every citizen of the empire refuge in my lands. An enormous operation, but together we can build and expand existing cities where your culture can bloom and blossom. not an empire of your own but living as respected brothers in my kingdom where we can honour God side by side. The third choice is the most ambitious and the most uncertain. We fight. We fight and we drive them from the continent completely. I am prepared to, but this will be extremely difficult. And if the empire does indeed wish this, it will be extremely dependant on Castilian aid and military security. It will require extraordinary effort on my part and on that of my kingdom. If we should decide to fight beyond the aid already given, I am only willing to give it if there is an actual chance of victory. I will regard this ask and cry for help for what it is: 'Help us please, for we cannot save ourselves.' I would have to think about what this would even look like, but I would require complete control and authority over the entire campaign. And the Byzantines themselves would be prepared as well to fight for their very survival as well. I hope you can see that from my perspective, these are the only best choices before us. And please understand that I do not want to extract things from you when your backs are against the wall. This is what I propose we do: I will instruct an expedition to be formed of 1000 of my best and most zealous order members. They will be led by officers trained in my academy, instructed how to counter Ottoman tactics. They carry 60.000 florins with Castilian experts and workers to help wall construction and repair. My officials will oversee that the funds are allocated to actual repairs. I can write this order tonight. Assembling this force will take some time, but I can set it in motion. Then, I will sail and visit your city myself to meet with your emperor himself and discuss the options before us. I hope you have had time to think and to make an informed choice. I can discuss what structure we would use should we go to war and other details about our cooperation when I meet with the emperor himself. There are many questions, i know. Will the help and cooperation reduce our independance? What about our culture? These matters will be discussed later when there is time and you have had time to think what you want. Only with the emperor can I definitively settle these matters. My aid gives us this time. What do you think?"

Four months of deputation meetings, procedural arguments, jurisdictional disputes. To address the general congregation, you must first petition the papal legate—yes, Cardinal Cesarini. But he cannot simply grant permission. The four deputations must agree. Each deputation must vote internally. The French will ask why a king with papal backing should address their Council. The radicals will suspect you've come to undermine their authority. And the Hussites, Your Majesty? You wish to speak with men who have fought off five papal crusades? You have just completed a crusade with papal blessing. You carry relics given by a Pope. Why should they trust you? What assurance do they have that you won't denounce them as heretics the moment you leave their presence? I do not say these meetings are impossible. But 'a few days'?

Three days of prayer, reflection, examination of conscience. Not as obligation to be endured while planning diplomacy, but as genuine spiritual foundation. Every morning at the cathedral. Every evening in reflection. You came here speaking of dark nights and lost paths. Find them first. Everything else flows from that. Second, you must understand that you are not the actor here. Your delegation—myself, Bishop Alfonso de Cartagena, the others—we have been here eight months. We have built relationships. We understand the currents. We know who trusts whom, who fears what. If diplomacy is to be conducted, let us conduct it in your name. You are the King of Castile. Kings do not petition for meetings. Kings do not chase down delegations. Your representatives do this. Third, listen before speaking. Attend the general congregation as observer. Sit quietly. Watch the deputations debate. See how the French argue, how the Germans respond, how the Italians maneuver. Learn the rhythm of this place before you try to change its tune. A week of observation would teach you more than a hundred meetings. Fourth—and hear me well—abandon this notion of personal declarations. If you have commitments to announce, let your delegation present them formally through proper Council channels. 'King Juan II of Castile has committed one thousand knights to Constantinople's defense.' Let them say it. In proper session. Through proper procedure. This honors the Council's authority while still making your position known. Finally, regarding Cesarini and the other leaders—if meetings are to happen, let them come to you. You are a king who has completed the Reconquista. You do not need to seek audiences. When word spreads of what you told the Byzantines today—and it will spread—others will seek you out.

No cushion. The discomfort feels right somehow. What if I am wrong? The question he brought to Basel, the weight on his soul. But he has been asking it about the wrong things. He thought he was asking: What if my reforms are wrong? What if my plans fail? No. The deeper question: What if my certainty that I must act is itself the wrong?

Juan's hands clasp tighter on the prayer rail. He has completed the Reconquista. He has returned relics to Rome. He has committed a thousand knights to Constantinople.

Because he sees the problem clearly and cannot accept that he might not be the solution. Because letting go feels like failure, like abandoning his duty, like cowardice. But what if letting go is the hardest courage of all? The candle flickers. Saint Barbara gazes down with painted serenity. She who was martyred by her own father rather than renounce her faith. She did not try to fix the world. She simply held to what was true and let God handle the rest. Make your own saddles well first. Everything else comes from that. Juan prays. Not the formal prayers of a king, not the grand petitions of a crusader. Simple, anguished words offered into the darkness of a side chapel."

He eats slowly, tasting little, his mind still in that small chapel. When Fray Hernando enters, the friar's sharp eyes immediately take in Juan's demeanor. Something has changed since this afternoon. The eager energy, the impatience to act—they are muted. In their place sits something quieter. Perhaps genuine reflection. Perhaps exhaustion. Perhaps both. Hernando settles into a chair across from Juan, his Franciscan robes rustling. He does not speak immediately, waiting instead to let the King set the tone. His weathered face shows caution, but also something like hope—the hope of a confessor who has prayed for his charge's soul and wonders if those prayers might be answered. The candles flicker between them. Outside, Basel settles into evening quiet."

This has led me to the arrogance to reform your church. I pray my intentions are pure, for I care greatly for your church, but I see now that it is not up to me to change this. I am your servant o Lord, and it is time for me to again understand this. I will serve you, not as a general or king, but as your humble, sinful servant. \"What if I am wrong?\", was the question you placed on me. And fortunately you place wise men on my path who have made me see that it is wrong for me to try and change the church. Even if all what I believe is right and all my reforms would help, then I would still be wrong to suggest it. I have been looking at the problem all wrong. I have been asking myself what is wrong with my actions while I should have been asking if it is right for me to act in the first place. And I now see the grace in letting that go. Even if it pains me greatly, this is merely the pain and hardship that comes with walking on the right path. And even in all of my sins father, I ask for you to be with me. And to help me. Grant your faithful servant Fray Hernando the patience to continue to help me. I do not deserve your mercy or your attention and I feel...small when I ask such things from you. Unworthy, yes.

You said you respected my counsel. You said you would not force the matter. You said you would complete your confession work. And then, within moments—moments, Your Majesty—you were arguing for why your plans should proceed. You showed me the papal decree. You explained why you must reform the Church. You had the language of humility, but the actions of a man who had already decided. Now you come to me with a confession of arrogance, of letting go, of understanding that it is not your place to change the Church. You speak of being God's humble servant. And I want to believe you, Your Majesty. I have prayed for this moment. I have begged God to open your eyes to the spiritual dangers I see. But I must ask: what has changed? This afternoon you were determined. Now you are contrite. This morning you agreed with my counsel, then immediately argued against it. How do I know this is not the same pattern? How do I know that tomorrow morning, when some messenger arrives or some opportunity presents itself, you will not again find reasons why your vision must proceed? You speak of letting go, of accepting that the Church may tear itself apart. These are profound realizations. But Your Majesty, I have been your confessor long enough to know that profound realizations in the evening can become forgotten wisdom by morning. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak. Tell me plainly, Your Majesty. What happened this afternoon that brought you to this place? Not the words you think I want to hear. Not the theological language of humility. Tell me the truth of it. What did you see or hear or feel that changed you? And more importantly—how will you remain changed when the morning comes and the world presses its demands upon you again? I will help you, Your Majesty. I swore before God to guide your soul. But I cannot offer absolution for words alone. Show me the substance behind them."

Sometimes I have insights, or you could call them revelations, and they show me something and they push me in the right direction. But the flesh is weak and this is not something that can ever be definitevely won, but is more like a constant struggle. At least it seems like that to me. And before I answer your question about what happened, let me stress that the very foundation for our every talk and confession is that I am honest with you. I do not guard my words or feelings. I find great comfort in this and I hope you share this as well. Even if it exposes my sins. This midday, I walked around the city by myself and struck up a conversation with an old saddle maker. He commented on how the council had spent months discussing with nothing to show for it while he had made more than forty saddles. I commented that I would like very much to \"fix their saddle as well\", and we continued this comparison. He made the distinction that he would never walk into a noble man's home and comment that his saddle is wrong and that he must fix it. A comment that struck home very clearly. It is not my task to change the church, and even if I did have exactlly the right reform, no one would listen or even accept it. I must let go. And my own drive for pushing for this reform I recognized for the precieved divine guidance and over confidence you have warned me about. I still do not know exactly what to do and I fully realize that wanting to change the world is potentially very dangerous."

I appreciate your honesty, Your Majesty. And I note that you do not claim grand revelation or divine vision. You speak of a conversation with a craftsman, a simple analogy that struck home. This... this sounds true to me. More true than theological language would. You say this is a constant struggle. Yes. This is wisdom. You say insights do not guard you forever. Also wisdom. You admit you do not know what to do next. More wisdom still. All of this is good, Your Majesty. All of this suggests genuine reflection occurred today. But I must speak plainly. You have had insights before. After the Infantes' rebellion, you spoke of humility. After Father Tomás refused you absolution, you wrestled with your soul. Each time, genuine struggle. Each time, real growth. And each time... Each time, Your Majesty, the world presented new opportunities, and the old patterns returned. Not because you are evil or insincere. But because, as you say, the flesh is weak. So here is what I propose. Not absolution tonight. Not yet. Tomorrow you will complete your second day of reflection. And I will give you a task—not to contemplate grand theological questions, but something simple. Concrete. Tomorrow, you will attend the Council session as observer only. You will sit in the back, as you did today. You will watch. You will listen. And when your mind begins to say 'I could fix this' or 'If only they would hear my proposal'—and it will say these things, Your Majesty—you will note it. You will write it down. Every time. Every impulse to act, to speak, to fix. You will bring me this list tomorrow evening. This is how we test whether the insight of the afternoon can survive the morning. Not by your words tonight, but by your actions tomorrow. Can you watch the Church struggle and not intervene? Can you let go in practice, not merely in principle?

I have spent these eight months here certain—certain—that the Council represents Christ's will, that Rome's claims are prideful usurpation of Christ's authority given to all the faithful, not one man. And yet. You kneel here and confess that every time you hear of reform, you presume to know better. You say this as sin. And I think... do I not do the same? When I hear the papal loyalists speak, do I not immediately presume they are wrong, that I see clearly what they do not? But here is where I struggle with your prayer, my Spanish friend. You ask 'what can I do?' and answer yourself that only God can move hearts. You speak of placing faith in trust and guarding against presumption. All of this is... humble. True. But sometimes, is action not required? When the Church bleeds from corruption—when bishops hold ten benefices while their flocks starve, when simony rules in Rome, when the faithful cry out for reform—is it enough to guard against presumption? Or does God require us to act, even imperfectly, even presumptuously? I do not know you, Spanish lord. But I see you struggle honestly with these questions. So I ask you: if you see evil and have power to fight it, is it not also sin to do nothing? To hide behind humility while corruption flourishes?"

Bishop Alfonso de Cartagena speaks well in the congregations. Your countrymen have proposed reforms—pluralism, simony, clerical concubinage. Good reforms. Sound reforms. Three of their proposals have been incorporated into Council decrees. But here is the thing, my Spanish friend. Your delegation proposes reforms, and this is good. But they dance around the central question. They seek middle ground where no middle ground exists. You say we should focus on what unites us—fighting corruption. Yes, agreed. But how do we fight it? This is where we divide. If the Pope can veto any reform the Council passes, what good are our decrees? If Eugenius can dissolve this Council tomorrow—as he tried to do!—then our work means nothing. The Castilians say 'let both authorities claim credit for reform.' Clever. Diplomatic. But it avoids the question: when Pope and Council disagree, who decides? If we pass decree against simony and Pope says no, what then? We go home with our principles intact and Rome continues as before? You ask what a noble can do. I say: a noble with influence can speak the truth. Can say clearly: the Council of the faithful, guided by Holy Spirit, must have authority to reform the Church—even over papal objection. This is not presumption. This is Scripture. Where two or three gather in Christ's name, He is there. Not the Pope alone. We, the gathered faithful. Your delegation seeks compromise.

You say you would compromise with papal overreach to prevent greater evil. That you would rather have imperfect church than one fighting itself to death. Eight months I have been here. Eight months arguing, debating, fighting for what I believe is right. And every day I grow more certain that I am right—that the Council must have supremacy, that Rome's corruption must be broken, that we must act decisively or the Church dies. But you ask... what if my certainty is itself the problem? What if in fighting for the Church's soul, we destroy its body? I do not agree with you, Spanish lord. I cannot. To compromise with what I see as tyranny feels like... like betraying everything I have fought for. Like telling God that His truth is not worth the struggle. And yet. You say we are supposed to be on opposite sides, but here we kneel together. You say you would be in communion with me under the same roof. And I think... is this not what we claim to want? Unity in Christ? But how do we have unity when we disagree on fundamental questions of authority? I do not know, my friend. I came here this morning certain. You have made me... less certain. I do not know if this is gift or curse. You invite me to pray with you. To finish together as brothers in Christ despite our differences. This is... this is beautiful thing you offer. And part of me wants to accept—to kneel here and simply be two men before God, not conciliarist and papalist, not French and Spanish. But I fear, my Spanish friend. I fear that if I pray with you in spirit of compromise and letting go, I betray everything I have fought for. I fear that your words, however sincere, are the voice of... what is the word... of accommodation with evil. That I will wake tomorrow softer, less willing to fight, and the corruption will continue because men like me chose peace over truth. And yet I also fear that my certainty is the presumption you prayed about. That I have become so convinced of my rightness that I cannot see my own sin. What do we do with such fears? How do we know which voice is God's and which is our own pride?"

I agree like almost everyone that reform is needed and great to hear that we have made progress. But the larger matter seems to be who is in charge. I understand the idea of a large congregation deciding things on behalf of the church. But I have also seen the benefits of one figurehead, the pope, moving christendom and the entire church in one direction. Can both exist? I mean - I gesture to the council - they take years to come to any decision. Not perfect either one should think."

You say we take years to decide anything. Yes. True. Frustrating, maddening even. But do you know what the Pope decided in one day? To dissolve this Council entirely. One man, one decision—'these gathered bishops trouble me, so they are dismissed.' Is this the efficiency you admire? Pope Eugenius tried to end us with a stroke of his pen. Only because Emperor Sigismund threatened to withdraw support did he relent. One man nearly destroyed the only hope for reform because it inconvenienced him. This is your figurehead moving Christendom in one direction. You speak of benefits of papal leadership. I speak of decades of simony, of benefices sold to highest bidder, of bishops who have never seen their flocks, of corruption so deep it rots the Church from within. The Pope has had centuries to reform these evils. What has he done? Nothing. Because reform threatens his power. But when the Council—the gathered faithful guided by Holy Spirit—passes decrees against pluralism, against simony, against concubinage, suddenly reform is possible. Why? Because we answer to Christ and Scripture, not to Roman politics. You ask if both can exist. I ask you: when father and children disagree on what is right, who decides? If father says 'we will steal from neighbors' and children say 'this is sin'—do we compromise? Do we steal only a little? No. The father who leads into sin must be corrected by the faithful who know better. This is not about power, my Spanish friend. This is about truth. The Pope is not infallible. He is man, capable of sin, capable of error. The gathered Council, praying and discerning together, is more likely to find God's will than one man surrounded by corrupt advisors in Rome. But I understand your concern. We are slow. We fight amongst ourselves. Perhaps this is our weakness. Perhaps God tests us to see if we can govern ourselves better than one tyrant governs us. I do not know if we will pass this test. You Castilians sit in the middle, proposing compromises. I do not hate you for it. But I believe you are wrong.

You think of the saddler Heinrich, content in his craft, letting customers come to him. You think of Bishop Jean, fighting the enemy instead of the problem. You think of Fray Hernando's constant vigilance against your presumption. All true. All wise. And yet. You are not a monk. You are a king. The men kneeling around you in this cathedral—some of them have spent years examining their souls, parsing the difference between divine calling and human pride, between service and self-aggrandizement. They have that luxury. They can afford to wait, to contemplate, to let God's will reveal itself in the fullness of time. But you have a kingdom. You have a pregnant wife waiting in Toledo. You have Byzantine emperors whose city falls closer to Ottoman conquest each day. You have one thousand knights and sixty thousand florins committed to Constantinople's defense. You have a papal decree and a meeting with Cardinal Cesarini in mere hours."

He also made decisions that changed the course of history. He did not spend His ministry in constant self-examination, frozen by fear that every action might be presumption. You stare up at the crucifix. Is there not a sin in under-using the gifts God gave you? In so fearing pride that you become useless? Granada fell because you led armies with conviction, not because you hesitated. The crusade succeeded because you made decisions, not because you endlessly second-guessed them."

You noticed your own language drifting toward placing yourself at the center, and you brought it to me for examination. This is spiritual maturity. So let us examine it together. You say you are happy and relieved that 'we can save the Church.' Already better language than 'I will reform the Church.' But then you say 'Cesarini has put me at the fulcrum.' What does that reveal? I think it reveals something true and something dangerous living together. The true part: You do have a significant role to play. Papal decree, moral authority from Granada, fresh perspective, willingness to bridge factions—these are real. Cesarini clearly sees value in your involvement. That is not pride, that is reality. The dangerous part: Your natural drift is toward seeing yourself as the key piece. The fulcrum—the point on which everything else turns. Not 'one person among many working together,' but 'the person around whom the solution revolves.' You caught yourself before saying it fully, which is good. But the fact that you drifted there... Your Majesty, I think you carry a burden many men in power carry: the belief that if you are not central, nothing will get done. That if you do not make things happen, they will not happen.

What actually happened was Cardinal Cesarini and I discussed an approach together, and I am one part of it. But yes, the way I spoke just now—\"I have made a plan\"—that does reveal pride. Help me understand why I defaulted to that language.' Second way—defending: 'I know it sounds presumptuous, but actually I am in a unique position with papal decree and crusader authority, and convincing the Pope is logical given my circumstances, and most clergy don't practice confession as much as I do, and I am ready to stand before God's judgment, so really my presumption is justified by my special situation.'

The electoral reform decree took six months from proposal to passage. Six months for a document about how to choose bishops. What would you have us accomplish while you are gone? I will not promise what this Council cannot deliver."

Appealing to man's better nature is always good, but I have learned that real power often speaks much more strongly than just words. When I spoke with the pope he understood that reform was needed, but he did not want to bow down to the power of the council. He is more concerned about his position than he is with reforming the church. I have found a way for him to support the reform without losing authority over the council. I have with me a copy of the reforms passed by the council the pope can pass the exact same decree on his own initiative. He is not acknowledging the authority of the council, but the decree on reforms has been passed anyway. I would also like to make clear that the church will have to find a way stay united. And that there are limits to the pope's military might and support. I lend my sword to christendom but I refure to fight for more wealth for bishops. I actually think that recognizing haec sancta would to wonders to unite the church, even though that might not be realistic right now. There should be a pope, but the church is simply too large now to be ruled by any single person. It would be a strong signal if you support this position as well. If both you, who are emperor of all lands north of rome and I who through my alliance control the lands to the south, speak with one voice in these matters, we might achieve what we individually might not. I was hoping that if we can adopt a position together, we might put more pressure on the church to be united. Since we want the same outcome. Push through reforms using this system. Declare a crusade against the Ottomans. When the church is reformed in this way, much support for the hussites hopefully falls away as well. If there are still nobles who have used the rebellion for their own personal gain, we can demand their lands back, hopefully without conflict. That is what I hope for."

Here is Castile. Here is the Empire. Between us—France, Burgundy, the Italian states. We share no border. Our armies cannot support each other directly. If Eugenius refuses our reforms, I cannot march on Rome, and neither can you. So what can we do together? First: diplomatic coordination. We speak with one voice. Letters delivered simultaneously. Ambassadors instructed to reinforce each other's positions. If the Pope hears the same message from Vienna and Toledo on the same day, he knows this isn't one king's hobby—it's a coalition. Second: economic pressure. The Church depends on revenue from our lands. If we instruct our clergy to delay annate payments pending reform... that's leverage. Not refusal—delay. 'We support the Holy Father, but our bishops require clarity on the new assessment procedures before they can calculate what they owe.' Bureaucratic obstruction in service of reform. Third: the implicit threat. We don't need to say it directly, but Eugenius knows: if Pope and Council split into open schism, secular rulers choose which pope to recognize. If we signal that our support for him depends on reform, he understands the alternative. We don't threaten—we simply remind him that unity requires compromise from everyone. Fourth: Basel itself. Your delegation remains there. I'll return there within weeks. If we coordinate with the German moderates, Cardinal Cesarini, whatever reasonable Italians remain—we build a reform faction that neither French radicals nor papal hardliners can ignore. Weight of numbers. Should we include language about commitment? Yes—but carefully. Something like: 'We pledge to coordinate our efforts in support of these reforms, to encourage their adoption by all Christian princes, and to work toward Church unity through genuine reform rather than factional victory.' What we don't say publicly is the harder question. Are we willing to recognize a Council-elected pope if Eugenius refuses reform entirely and Basel deposes him? Are we willing to withhold recognition from Eugenius if he tries to dissolve Basel again? Those are the real teeth, Juan. The ultimate leverage. I'm not asking you to answer tonight—but you should think about where your limits are. How far are you willing to go if the Pope chooses confrontation over compromise?"

Properly directed, they could become the finest heavy infantry in Christendom. Men who genuinely believe they fight for God do not break when lesser men would flee. The Academy's tactics—disciplined formations, coordinated maneuver, integration with artillery—these require soldiers who obey without question. Calatrava's monastic discipline already instills this. They are accustomed to rules, to hierarchy, to sublimating individual will to collective purpose. I would suggest: make Calatrava the model for your professional core. Send their officers to the Academy first. Let Sir Thomas Beaumont work with their existing discipline rather than against it.

The Orders of the Reconquista repopulated the lands they conquered. They granted fueros—charters—to villages, attracted settlers, built churches and mills and markets. Santiago did this better than anyone. They know how to turn conquered territory into productive Christian land.

The men there do not know me. They must see Your Majesty's authority, not merely hear my claim to it. Second: communication. Messages from Constantinople to Castile will travel slowly—weeks at best, months if weather or war disrupts the routes. I propose establishing a relay through Venice or Genoa. Merchants travel those routes regularly. A letter entrusted to the right trading house can move faster than any courier we send alone. With Your Majesty's permission, I will arrange this and send word of which merchant houses to trust with return correspondence. Third: diplomatic authority. When I stand before the Greek Emperor, what may I promise on Your Majesty's behalf? I understand the sixty thousand florins and the three hundred knights are committed. But if Emperor John asks for more—more men, more gold, a formal alliance—what am I permitted to say? I do not wish to overpromise and shame Castile. Nor do I wish to seem cold and lose Greek confidence. Clear boundaries will help me navigate whatever I find there. Answer these three questions, and I will have everything I need.

In Granada, we fought with our backs to Castile. Supply lines measured in days. Reinforcement always possible. In Morocco... In Morocco, we fight with our backs to the sea.

He administers the city, handles the population, maintains order. And we... We establish outposts nearby. Fortified positions. Not to rule, but to protect. To ensure that when the Sultan of Fez or some tribal confederation comes to punish this vassal for his submission to a Christian king, he finds Castilian steel between him and his target. It is clever. I will grant that. It addresses the core problem—administration and supply. A Muslim vassal rules Muslims. He knows the language, the customs, the politics.

That would be foolish—we would inherit empty fields, silent workshops, dead markets. Instead, we establish authority. Christian lords, Christian law, Christian churches. But the Muslim population remains, at first. They work. They pay taxes. They see that Christian rule is not the catastrophe their imams promised. Then, gradually, we settle Christians among them. Farmers from Castile and León, seeking land. Merchants looking for opportunity. Priests building parishes. Over years—sometimes decades—the balance shifts.

Sometimes God takes those we love, and there is no why that makes sense to mortal minds. Sometimes the answer to 'why' is simply that we live in a fallen world where mothers die in childbirth and fathers bury sons and all our prayers cannot stop it. You did not kill Isabel. Your sins—whatever they are—did not kill Isabel. Childbirth killed Isabel. The same thing that kills thousands of women every year, queen and peasant alike. You could have been the holiest man in Christendom and she might still have bled to death in that bed. So no, Juan. I do not think the Lord would have spared her if you had done more. I think the Lord, in His infinite wisdom that we cannot comprehend, decided it was her time. And I hate Him for it right now. I hate Him and I love Him and I do not understand Him at all. Do not do what I did. Do not spend years searching for a sin that explains this. You will find sins—we all have them—but none of them killed your wife. None of them. She loved you. She died loving you. That is not nothing. That is not punishment. That is grace, even in the midst of tragedy."

It cuts both ways. Aragón remains your closest ally. King Alfonso has no daughters, but there are Aragonese noble houses with eligible women. France and England are entangled in their endless war. A French match would anger England; an English match would anger France. Neither is advisable unless you wish to enter that conflict. The Italian states offer possibilities—Naples, Milan, the Papacy's orbit of noble families. The Empire—Sigismund has no legitimate children, but there are Habsburg and Wittelsbach connections. Practical factors: You need more children. Fernando is healthy, but one son is not security. You need a wife who can bear children—young, healthy, from fertile stock. You need a wife who can manage the court. Isabel grew into this role beautifully, but she started uncertain. A woman with natural authority would ease the transition. You need a wife who will not destabilize existing alliances or create new enemies."

Father: A younger brother of Niccolò III d'Este, who died of fever when Lucia was approximately six years old. His name has faded from prominence—he held no significant titles or lands of his own, being a younger son, and died before he could distinguish himself. Mother: A noblewoman of a minor Italian house (likely from the Romagna or Emilia region), who died shortly after her husband, leaving the young Lucia an orphan. Upbringing: Raised at the Este court in Ferrara as a ward of her uncle Niccolò III. She grew up alongside his legitimate and illegitimate children, receiving the same education and refinements. The Marquess, despite his many flaws, has always acknowledged his duty to family. Lucia was never neglected—she was given tutors, fine clothing, and a place at court befitting her blood.

I know it may be a bit uncommon, but I know that I would like to hear from you if our roles were reversed. My name is Juan of Castille, father of Catalina and Fernando. I have been told that you are astute and informed, so I assume you know of my exploits. But all I really ever set out to do was to do good, be just and fight for what is right. Uncompromisingly so. Fighting for the kingdom of heaven, as I would say poetically, but dont tell my confessor this. People get all sorts of upset when I say I catch a glimpse of heaven when I see someone perform a good deed. I have instructed my delegation to seek your hand in marriage. Not only do I hope your family will agree, I hope that you yourself will agree with this union as well. You will be my queen, a demanding role. But I hope that you with your sharp mind and witty tongue will find this role easy. I have attached a portrait of myself with this letter. It is as real as any artist can paint it, I promise. I am otherwise in good health and without injury. Should the marriage go ahead, I will make every accomodation for you and your ladies in waiting to feel welcome in a kingdom so foreign to your own. I invite you to take your Italian culture and spirit with you so it may enrich my palace and the heart of my court. I look forward to meeting you in person, so I can also introduce you to Catalina. A princess needs a mother and I so very hope that you two will get along. She is the most wonderful, curious and brave girl I know. But so would any father say about his daughter I guess.

He commanded a company at Málaga—acquitted himself well. He could lead a hundred lances and not disgrace himself. The stocky one beside him—Rodrigo Manrique. Slower to learn, but steady. He does not panic. In a siege, holding a wall, you want men like him. I could give you eight, perhaps ten, who are ready for real command. Another fifteen who could serve as junior officers under experienced captains. But Your Majesty... Constantinople is not a training ground. If you send boys to learn war against the Ottomans, many of them will learn only how to die."

What they lack is knowledge of Ottoman warfare specifically. Their experience is against the Moors, who fight differently. First: I could assign my best cadets as observers, not commanders. Attach them to the Order captains, let them watch, learn, record. They study Ottoman tactics firsthand and bring that knowledge back to the academy. We build a library of experience for future campaigns. Second: Before the expedition departs, I could conduct intensive instruction for the Order officers themselves—a week, perhaps two, on what we know of Ottoman methods. The feigned retreats. The horse archery. The janissary formations. János Hunyadi's letters have been... invaluable. The man knows his enemy. I have been translating his observations into training exercises. Third: When the expedition returns—God willing, when, not if—we debrief every officer extensively. What worked. What failed. What surprised them. That knowledge becomes the foundation for training the next generation. The academy should not try to lead this expedition, Your Majesty. The Order masters would rightly resent boys commanding veterans. But we can learn from it. We can prepare those who go. And we can ensure that the blood spent in Constantinople purchases wisdom for Castile. There is one more thing. If Your Majesty permits."

Experienced soldiers return from campaign, and their knowledge... scatters. They go back to their estates, their garrisons, their families. What they learned dies with them, or survives only in tavern stories. The Ottomans do not make this mistake. Their janissaries train together, fight together, teach together. Knowledge passes from veteran to recruit in an unbroken chain. It is one of the reasons they are so formidable. When your seven hundred return from Constantinople, I would ask Your Majesty's permission to keep some of them. Not permanently—perhaps six months, a year. The best of them, the ones who learned the most. Let them teach at the academy. Let them drill the cadets in what they saw, what they faced, what they survived. Knights do not like to teach. They think it beneath them. But if it came as a royal command—a mark of honor, to be selected as an instructor at the King's own academy... Pride can be redirected, if you know how to push it. In five years, Your Majesty, I could give you officers who have never seen an Ottoman but know how to fight them. In ten years, I could give you an army that does not need to learn on the battlefield—because the lessons have already been paid for in other men's blood."

As they work, you explain the situation to Lucia, who listens from the bed, wrapped in silks, her sharp mind absorbing every detail. The Church is fractured. Pope Eugenius IV sits in Rome, but his authority is contested by the Council of Basel, which claims that a general council of the Church holds authority superior to any pope. The conciliarists at Basel push for reforms—limits on papal power, restrictions on benefices, an end to certain abuses—while Eugenius resists what he sees as an assault on the very foundations of papal supremacy. Castile has walked a careful line. Fray Hernando led your delegation at Basel with skill, positioning Castile as a moderate voice—supportive of genuine reform, but not hostile to papal authority. The situation with Constantinople complicates everything. The Byzantine Emperor desperately needs Western aid against the Ottomans, but he also needs Church unity—specifically, reunion between the Eastern and Western churches."

In the past six months, we have confirmed reports of fourteen merchant vessels attacked or seized in waters between Málaga and Almería. Another eight along the approaches to the Strait itself. The corsairs operate primarily from Tétouan, Tangier, and most aggressively from Salé—the same city that rejected Commander Martín's delegation. Salé is effectively a corsair republic; the Marinid Sultan has no control there whatsoever. Direct losses to Castilian merchants: approximately twelve thousand florins in cargo and vessels over the past year. But the greater damage is indirect. Merchants now demand higher fees for the risk, or refuse certain routes entirely. Venetian and Genoese traders are beginning to favor other ports—Valencia, Barcelona—where the crown of Aragon provides better escort. This costs us perhaps another twenty to thirty thousand florins annually in trade that simply goes elsewhere. The crown fleet is growing, but it is designed for military transport and major naval engagements—not the constant patrol work required to suppress piracy. For that, we would need lighter, faster vessels stationed permanently at the coastal ports. Galleys or caravels that can chase corsairs into shallow waters where our larger ships cannot follow. This is where the question of ports becomes relevant, Your Majesty. If the Orders held coastal fortifications with associated harbors—even small ones—they could maintain patrol vessels as part of their garrison duties. It would give them naval experience gradually, in defensive operations, before any thought of offensive campaigns against Morocco."

Fernando slept in a cradle nearby, wrapped in white linen, his tiny chest rising and falling with the steady rhythm of infant dreams. Doña Beatriz sat a respectful distance away, close enough to assist with the children if needed, far enough to allow privacy. Doña Leonor de Almeida had taken the other position, her eyes bright with curiosity about the woman who would become her new queen. The table was set for two, as planned. The wines stood ready—the Ribera del Duero already breathing, the white from Rueda chilled in a basin of cold water, the Málaga and the monastery vintage waiting in reserve.

I was often a captive in my own palace. One day I decided that it must end. And I realized that I had to do something extraordinary and unexpected for me to take control of my kingdom. To truly be king. So I went on a pilgrimage. Insane, since the realm was on the verge of rebellion. If I left but for a short while, the sharks would close in. But I had to try, so I gambled it all. I guess that is where the rumours started about me talking with God and all other nonsense. I indicated that I would leave on pilgrimage and would let the divine spirit guide me on my journey. I knew from the start that I had to go to Rome and ask for crusade. Only that would give me the authority to unite the realm not only under my rule, but it would also unite the kingdom against our common enemy. I had to rely on my divine guidance quite often for I went back to my palace to retrieve my father's sword, right at the moment when a rebellious plot was revealed. Maybe the divine inspired me to have someone signal to me when the rebels entered the meeting room or maybe the divine inspired me to actually want them to reveal themselves the moment they thought me gone. Or maybe both. Anyway, the result was that the rebels died an unfortunate death and my realm is now secure. And everyone thinks I am still the mad king who leaves to go on a pilgrimage while his nobles plot his downfall. But there is another side as well. I really do take my faith very seriously and I want to make sure I never become an arrogant, heartless king I see some others become. I do ride out at the head of my knights in my white armour, knowing full well that I am a major target for every enemy lance and archer. I have learned to not be afraid and I gladly lay my life in God's hands. Now dont confuse this bravery with recklessness. I try not to be. But I know that if I can approach a fort alone and negotiate a surrender, purely by my own presence, I know I will save my men and that it's a risk worth taking. More wine?"

And you ride at the head of your knights not because you seek martyrdom, but because you have calculated that your presence saves more lives than your caution would. In Ferrara, my uncle is considered a master of such games. He has survived assassination attempts, rival claimants, and the endless scheming of Milan and Venice by letting everyone underestimate him. He plays the simple soldier, the bluff condottiero, while his mind works three moves ahead. I recognize the pattern. I am... familiar with the difference between what a ruler shows and what a ruler is. But there is something I do not yet understand. You speak of faith genuinely. You speak of not wishing to become heartless. You established a charity of twenty-five thousand florins in your dead wife's name—not from the treasury, but from your personal fortune. You carried your daughter through a feast, introducing her to every noble house like she was a treasure rather than a political asset. The mask I understand. The calculation I understand.

Her eyes glistened in the candlelight. Not tears—not quite—but something had shifted behind them.

I am trying to help reform the church, did you know? There is only so much I can do and a few weeks at Basel almost drove me insane, but we try. Isabel...she was always very pious. In a very committed way. She was very young when we married, maybe some more years would have granted her more wisdom. But she had a faith so pure and convincing, we shared this vision yes. But it mostly involved the joy of our family. Becoming a father has been the most pure vision of God's kingdom I ever saw. I see it still when I look at Catalina and how she is curious and discovers the world. The painting I had made of our wedding was meant to convey exactly that. The attainment of the kingdom of heaven through her."

Tolerance of mistresses. A shared table and separate beds. No one told me to expect a man who speaks of his dead wife with such tenderness. Who sees the kingdom of heaven in his daughter's curiosity. I am not Isabel, Your Majesty. I am not young, not pure, not... uncomplicated in my faith. I have read things my confessor would burn me for. I have asked questions that made my tutors stammer. I have a tongue that has gotten me into trouble more times than I can count. My uncle once said I would either marry a king or be locked in a convent, because no ordinary man would tolerate me. I came here to see if your eyes matched your letter. They do. More than I expected. But I need to know something else. Something the letter did not address. If I marry you—if I become Queen of Castile, stepmother to your children, partner in this vision you speak of—what place will I hold? Will I be a companion in this work you describe? Will I have a voice, a role, a purpose beyond bearing heirs? Or will I be kept safe and comfortable while you ride off to Constantinople and Granada and wherever else God's kingdom calls you, waiting at home like a portrait on a wall?"

How the city that had preserved Roman civilization while the West fell into darkness now paid tribute to the Ottoman Sultan like a vassal, bleeding three hundred thousand silver coins each year simply to survive. He told her of Sotomayor's three hundred knights, already arrived, already working to shore up defenses. Of the remaining seven hundred he planned to bring in spring. Of the sixty thousand florins already sent for wall repairs—and how even that enormous sum was insufficient. He told her of the Emperor's request: not just soldiers, not just gold, but Juan himself. A personal visit. A statement to the world that Christendom had not abandoned the Queen of Cities. He told her of his promise to Pope Eugenius—made at Rome, sealed at the Council of Basel—that Castile would stand for the defense of the Faith. That the Reconquista's completion was not an ending but a beginning. And he told her the darker truth beneath it all: that Constantinople would likely fall regardless.

My strength is my honesty and the fact that I can unite men through a common vision, purpose that is greater than just Juan. Imagine the court encounter we just had but now without us being christian. We could never have been able to unite as much. Christianity grants purpose, good deeds, family values, it grants us so much. Too much to even to start to number. I place my faith in that and you can place your faith in me.

If I approach him because someone else told me to, I would not be seeking out confession because I wanted to but to please others. What you talk about has been discussed with Hernando many times. And let me be as clear as possible. I could be sitting comfortably in Toledo right now. Ignore the plight of the Greeks. Let nobles shower me with gifts and flattery. Let Alvaro and other advisors run the kingdom. Try and make the best choices for the kingdom, sure. Be a just and rightful king, easy when you never leave the capital. Maybe once make a large donation to a crusade or found a church and feel like you contribute. That is how most men live their lives. I push myself to do the maximum possible to make the world better. I call it the kingdom of heaven, but it really means a better world. Thinking about this, makes me happy. Knowing that I am working on making the world better. Theologically, I would say that I am divinely inspired and Hernando agrees that this is the case. But that does not mean that I will not go thirsty in the desert. I will just like anyone. So you could say that God sets me to task, but he does not chop the wood for me. That I have to do myself. God does not protect me in battle. Me being careful and a good armour does. Speak to anyone who was with me in the battles. I do participate in charges and lead from the front, but I am never reckless. I accept danger, sure, but never without reason. I could die in battle, you could die in childbirth. The things we can not change are in God's hands. I will surround you with the best care when delivering and will love and support you as best I can. But the rest is in the hands of God. And then I say: place your trust in him. We cannot worry about the things we cannot control. When I next seek out confession, I will discuss with Hernando if presumption is being kept at bay. And I value your council love. I really do. I do not always act the way you would want me to, but I do always want to hear from you."

You now control Santiago, Calatrava, and Alcántara by papal decree. The masters answer to Castile's crown. These orders have commanderies in Aragon. They hold lands, collect revenues, wield influence. When Aragonese clergy look at what happened in Castile, they wonder: are we next? Will Your Majesty seek similar authority over institutions that have traditionally answered to... other powers? Second: appointments. The bishops of Castile are, increasingly, men who align with royal interests. This is natural—kings prefer cooperative clergy. But Aragon has its own traditions. The Cathedral Chapter of Barcelona has elected its own bishops for centuries. If 'unity' means Castilian influence over Aragonese appointments—if Toledo begins to speak for Barcelona—there will be resistance. Quiet resistance, perhaps. But real. Third: Basel. Your Majesty supported Pope Eugenius against the Council. This was wise—Eugenius prevailed, and you have his gratitude. But some Aragonese clergy supported the Council's reforms. They believed—still believe—that the Church needs change, that papal authority has grown too absolute, that councils should check papal power. These men are not heretics. They are not your enemies. But they wonder if Your Majesty's closeness to Eugenius means they will be... remembered. Punished. Passed over for preferment because they chose the wrong side in a dispute that is supposedly resolved."

The Infantes Juan and Enrique are dead. Their legitimate male issue—Carlos of Viana—is also dead. This leaves... King Ferdinand of Aragón, Alfonso's father, had one other son who survived infancy. That son married into the House of Trastámara. His daughter María is our regent. His son... His son is Your Majesty. By strict succession law, should Alfonso die without heir, the Crown of Aragón would pass to the descendants of Ferdinand's second son—that is, to Juan II of Castile. Your Majesty is, in fact, Alfonso's heir presumptive. The regency council is aware of this. The factions are aware of this. When Your Majesty speaks of 'bringing kingdoms together,' every man in Barcelona hears it through this lens. I would suggest that further discussions regarding succession—or visions of unity—include Her Majesty the Regent and the full council. These are not matters for private conversations with faction leaders and bishops. Is there anything else Your Majesty requires for the midday reception with the Consell de Cent?"

Fourth, that Our officials shall adopt a practice of informing the merchants of Portugal and Aragón of significant changes to customs rates and trading regulations, so that honest traders may make informed decisions. Fifth, that We encourage the city of Barcelona, should it choose to host a gathering of traders from the Christian kingdoms of Iberia, and We shall encourage Castilian merchants to attend such a meeting in good faith, sending proper delegation to work toward the common flourishing of trade.

My grandfather heard Pedro of Castile speak of knowing Aragón. It did not end well for anyone. You ask what everyone fears. I will tell you what I fear. I fear that my sons will die in Italy for a crown Alfonso will never wear. I fear that Aragonese gold will continue flowing south while our mountain villages empty. I fear that when Alfonso finally falls from a Neapolitan wall or catches Roman fever, the man who inherits will see Aragón as a treasury to be raided for Castilian ambitions. Your Majesty has sent forty thousand florins to support Alfonso's Italian campaign. Catalan ships carry Castilian gold to fund a war that has already cost me a nephew and three cousins' sons. So when Your Majesty speaks of wanting to know Aragón—I must ask: do you wish to know us as partners? Or as the next source of men and money for the next war?"

He has Provence to manage, a claim to Naples he cannot enforce alone, and less stomach for endless war than Louis had. Would he accept a white peace? No. But he might accept a partition. Alfonso keeps Calabria and Sicily. René takes Naples itself. Both claim the title, neither fights for it. It is ugly. It satisfies no one fully. But it stops the bleeding. Your Majesty has influence with Alfonso now. Castilian gold speaks loudly. If you counseled partition rather than total victory... But that is not what Your Majesty has done.

And so does his body—the particular way it settles, the restriction of breath, the way the world narrows to what can be seen through the visor. He leaves the visor up. These men need to see his face. The white banner of the crusade snaps in the February wind—the same banner that flew over Alhama, that was carried through the breach at Alcalá la Real, that Giovanni Rossi prayed beneath every night of the campaign. Brother Guillem's hands once steadied it. Marco Tornesi fought beneath its shadow. Those men are in Constantinople now. Or dead on the road there. Juan does not yet know which."

The church is divided and the eternal city, the last light of Christendom is about to be snuffed out. We have just won a great victory against the Moors and have done things no-one had deemed possible. We ended the reconquista. It was hard in the beginning. We have suffered setbacks and even defeats here and there. The muslims are hard fighters and they made us bleed made us suffer. Cut our supply lines. Left us hungry and miserable while we were sieging mighty walls. Right now, we are tired, sick. Maybe even hungry. Such is the fate of knights and soldiers. But have we not been here before? Have we not overcome hunger and pain? Yes! we have. We know what to do as well. We lack supplies, so we aquire more. We are sick, so we tend to our brothers until we are better. And when we are ready to move out, when we are ready to go on this incredible journey, only then we will leave. When I met the Greek delegation in Basel, they had given up all hope. No-one was going to help them. No-one had the courage, the will, the determination. No-one but the sons of Castille! We go where no-one else dared journey. We face what no-one else dared face. We fight for what everyone else seems to have forgotten. We know that when we raise our swords in the name of Christ, we serve a higher purpose."

Your Majesty has sent forty thousand florins to support Alfonso's Italian campaign. Catalan ships carry Castilian gold to fund a war that has already cost me a nephew and three cousins' sons. So when Your Majesty speaks of wanting to know Aragón—I must ask: do you wish to know us as partners? Or as the next source of men and money for the next war?"

He has Provence to manage, a claim to Naples he cannot enforce alone, and less stomach for endless war than Louis had. Would he accept a white peace? No. But he might accept a partition. Alfonso keeps Calabria and Sicily. René takes Naples itself. Both claim the title, neither fights for it. It is ugly. It satisfies no one fully. But it stops the bleeding. Your Majesty has influence with Alfonso now. Castilian gold speaks loudly. If you counseled partition rather than total victory... But that is not what Your Majesty has done.

We have suffered setbacks and even defeats here and there. The muslims are hard fighters and they made us bleed made us suffer. Cut our supply lines. Left us hungry and miserable while we were sieging mighty walls. Right now, we are tired, sick. Maybe even hungry. Such is the fate of knights and soldiers. But have we not been here before? Have we not overcome hunger and pain? Yes! we have. We know what to do as well. We lack supplies, so we aquire more. We are sick, so we tend to our brothers until we are better. And when we are ready to move out, when we are ready to go on this incredible journey, only then we will leave. When I met the Greek delegation in Basel, they had given up all hope. No-one was going to help them. No-one had the courage, the will, the determination. No-one but the sons of Castille! We go where no-one else dared journey. We face what no-one else dared face. We fight for what everyone else seems to have forgotten. We know that when we raise our swords in the name of Christ, we serve a higher purpose.

The annates decree alone reduces papal revenue by seventy-five percent. The pluralism decree strips Rome of the power to grant dispensations. These are not small concessions, Your Majesty. You are asking Eugenius to sign away powers his predecessors accumulated over centuries, and to do so in coordination with a council that has declared itself his superior."

Only the constitutional question—whether councils rule popes. And the constitutional question, by itself, is not enough to sustain Basel indefinitely. Men came to Basel for reform, for Bohemia, for crusade. If those are achieved, attendance will decline. The French faction cannot maintain a council alone.

The sin is negligence, not murder. You did not send those men into the sea. You did not summon the Mistral. You failed to prepare as well as you might have—and seventy-five men paid for that failure with their lives. This is a heavy burden. It should be heavy. A king who feels nothing when his men die is no king worth following. But there is a difference between carrying the weight of responsibility and drowning in guilt that serves no one. You say you think about them. That you will never totally forget them. Good. Remember their faces when you next command a fleet. Remember them when you are tempted to skip a drill because the men are tired or the weather is fair. Let their deaths teach you. But do not let their deaths consume you. That is not penance. That is pride wearing the mask of humility—the belief that you should have been able to control the wind and the waves. Is there more you wish to confess?

The room is small, sparse, monastic. A desk, two chairs, a crucifix on the wall. A window looks out onto a modest courtyard where herbs grow in orderly rows. Brother Tomás de Torquemada rises as you enter. He is younger than you expected—perhaps thirty-five, no more than forty. Tall, gaunt, with the hollow cheeks of a man who fasts often and seriously. His Dominican habit is immaculate but worn, the white wool greyed from many washings. His eyes are the most striking feature: dark, intense, burning with something that might be faith or might be fever. He bows—correctly, but without flourish."

What manner of king visits Basel and Rome in the same year, as if he were trying to hold the Church together with his own two hands? I have questions, Your Majesty. Many questions. About Granada.

I have a strong personal belief that the church is of enormous benefit, not just to my kingdom but to any kingdom. Farmers being called to mass by church bells all across the lands fills my heart with joy. To know God is being praised, confessions are being taken. To know we all lift one another up to live fulfilling lives in service. It is all I want, what I am fighting for and strikes me in my very core.

And the remainder—the discretionary funds, the benefice revenues, the annates—divided. Half to the Camera for these limited purposes. Half to the College of Cardinals as a body. Let them determine among themselves how to distribute their portion. This is... elegant. The cardinals who have built fortunes on Camera arrangements cannot openly oppose reform without revealing themselves as corrupt. But neither can they quietly sabotage it, because now their income depends on collective decision. Every cardinal becomes a watchdog over every other cardinal's share. Holy Father, the man who designed this understands politics. Which is precisely why I must ask questions that may seem impertinent. Your Majesty comes to Rome with six hundred knights.

From bishops who spoke eloquently of poverty while their servants wore silk. I do not say this to accuse. I say it because I have learned that words cost nothing. Even sincere words. Especially sincere words. You ask about the Camera's inner workings. I know them. Perhaps better than any man alive who is not directly employed there. Cardinal Albergati sent me on missions throughout Christendom. I saw how Rome's demands fell upon parishes in France, in Germany, in England. I saw priests who could not read Latin collecting fees they did not understand to send to an institution they had never seen. I have dreamed of this conversation, Your Majesty. Of a Pope who would finally act. Of reform that was more than words. Which is why I must be certain this is not a trap. Not a trap set by you—but a trap set by circumstance. By enthusiasm that outruns wisdom. If I put ink to paper tonight—if I help draft this decree—I become a target. Every cardinal who loses income will know my hand was in it. Cardinal Albergati, my patron, will be asked why his secretary helped destroy arrangements that have stood for generations. I have no family to protect me, no wealth to flee to, no lands to retire upon. I have only my position, and my position exists at the sufferance of men who will hate what we do here. So I ask again, differently: Not what does Castile gain. What happens to me when the cardinals learn what I have done? What protection exists for a scholar with ink-stained fingers when powerful men decide he knows too much?"

The Sacred Council, moved by the same Spirit that guides the Apostolic See, has wisely addressed the disorders of pluralism, concubinage, and excessive taxation that have long troubled the Body of Christ. These reforms, which we have received and promulgated by our own apostolic authority, demonstrate that Council and Pope, when animated by shared devotion to Christ's Church, labor toward the same holy ends.\n\nIn this same spirit of renewal, we have undertaken reform of the Apostolic Camera, that the administration of the Church's temporal affairs might better serve her spiritual mission. We have appointed our beloved son Tommaso Parentucelli as Extraordinary Commissioner, with authority to examine all arrangements, audit all accounts, and restructure all procedures according to principles of transparency, accountability, and honest stewardship. The enclosed decree sets forth these reforms in detail.\n\nWe invite the fathers assembled at Basel to receive this decree in the spirit in which it is offered—not as assertion of authority over Council, nor as submission of papal household to conciliar jurisdiction, but as evidence that Rome and Basel labor toward the same sacred purpose. As we have added our apostolic voice to the Council's reforms, so we invite the Council to add its voice to ours, that all Christendom might see the Church united in renewal.\n\nTo this end, we propose to send Our Venerable Brother Jean, Cardinal Priest of San Sisto, to Basel as our messenger and voice. Cardinal Rochetaillée has witnessed the events in Rome and can bear testimony to what he has seen. We commend him to you as one who has journeyed from opposition to cooperation, and whose counsel may assist in discerning how Council and Apostolic See might best coordinate their efforts.\n\nWe beseech the fathers at Basel to receive our messenger with charity, to consider our proposals with wisdom, and to join with us in prayer for the unity and renewal of Christ's Church.\n\nGiven at Rome, at Saint Peter's, on the [date] day of March, in the year of Our Lord 1434, in the fourth year of our pontificate."

The cardinals have endorsed it and while the council of basel has it's own process, I suspect that they will also sign the camera reform decree. Of the two families, you are the one who has chosen to cooperate. Embrace this reform or not, I do not care. But I will take issue with anyone who opposes it. I have already declared my allegiance to the pope and the reform and I will consider any hostile action against the pope as an act war and will react accordingly. You know what power and influence I command. And I always keep my word. You have a choice. You can let the church reform itself. Or you can join with those who want to violently oppose it. Those who choose violence, I will react in kind. I would rather count you among the allies of the pope, but the choice is yours. The plan is that Basel will sign into law the camera reform decree. Tommaso will seek out the rot in the church and grant amnesty to those who deserve it. Provided no-one decides to attack Rome, the reform will be enacted with or without blood. I prefer without."

Some of them would be right. The Patriarch would denounce it from every pulpit. He would say I am selling the empire to Catholic wolves.

If we are to build this plan together—if we are to present it to my nobles, my clergy, my people—then I must understand what shape it takes. What does Castile gain? What do you gain?

So no bowing down to the pope in Rome, you keep your religion such as it is. If ever the two churches want to come together, then it should be done out of genuine want, not out of desperation. Now, so far both the current situation and my offer of refuge in Castille. My question to Byzantine people is. Is there a problem? Do you require aid? Help to fight a fight you cannot win on your own. If the answer is that this is indeed the case, then I will take charge of the defence. That means no more hiding behind privilege and ancient agreement. Agreements that will be lost anyway when the city falls to the sultan. Whatever is left of the Byzantine empire will become part of the alliance between Aragon, Naples, Castille and Portugal. Only then will we be able to turn the tide. We in Iberia know what it is like to fight a reconquista and can teach you how to do the same. But if we are to bleed for someone else, we will only do so on our terms. So it means giving up pride and authority to let me lead the defence. I know that this is a difficult choice, but I want you to understand that this is not a demand at all. I offer you whatever I can give without asking for anything else in return. And consider the situation from our perspective and hopefully you and the others can see that I am sincere in what I offer. If you choose not to fight with us, then nothing is lost, everything I have given you stays here as a gift and my promise for refuge stays."

I shall provide shelter and refuge for the Byzantines in my kingdom. There you can live in peace and preserve your religion and culture. But it means leaving Constantinople. If you do not want that, I leave my gifts behind and sail away so the empire can sail its own course and maybe be absorbed by the Muslims. Tonight we are planning for the third option. An option that asks tremendous sacrifice both in blood and in pride. It is an option, mind you. Not a demand, rather a choice the Byzantine people should make. A choice with alternatives, for a choice without an alternative is no choice at all. I say this because I know that what I am about to plan for, may sound outlandish, maybe even insulting to the proud and prestigious people of the empire. I remind you again that we are planning for a choice, that this is not a demand. That I require authority not for personal gain or glory, but to unite everyone under one banner, one purpose. There simply is no time, space or room anymore for the old ways. We adapt or we die among ancient tradition. Now, firstly, Religion. Whatever will be discussed, the matter of the Filioque will not be. Now is not the time of religious reform or mending of the schism. That may come later if it will come at all. But I require nothing from the church except for the support both in holy service as in monetary terms as we all will have to pay. Secondly. I am in command. Me and only me. I will lead not just the defense of Constantinople, I will also have to lead the crowns of Naples, Aragon, Castile and Portugal in this fight and negotiate alliances with other christian kingdoms such as Hungary, Poland and the holy Roman empire. I have led a reconquista before and will do so again. Part of the choice is if the Byzantine people trust me with the leadership. Remember, I am not demanding, it is a choice. Thirdly, I will require you to fight like devils. No more hiding behind walls, titles or privilege. Christianity fights for your empire, and you will fight the hardest of all. I will militarize the nobility and arm every citizen. Trade, the church and science will be geared towards warfare. Everyone fights. Tonight we will draft proposals that detail in more specific terms what I have just laid out. So we can present this choice to the empire. After it has been presented, I will wait and will let you make a choice awaiting whatever you decide. You have been summoned to help me and the emperor in doing just this.

In months, not centuries. Without papal authority to bind them. Without lands to sustain them. And you expect the monasteries—who have guarded their independence for a thousand years—to simply... transform themselves into soldiers? I do not say it is impossible. I say I do not understand how you imagine it would work. The monks of Mount Athos would sooner burn their monasteries than take up swords. The Patriarch would excommunicate any priest who blessed such an order without his sanction. You speak of everyone fighting. But the Church fights with prayer, with teaching, with the preservation of sacred truth. If you wish to change that—if you wish Orthodox monks to become Latin-style warrior orders—you must explain how. And you must explain who would lead them, fund them, command them."

Tonight we will ask ourselves: 'If the Orthodox church would turn every effort into winning this war, what would that look like?' Can you help us answer that question Gennadios? And regarding the soldiers we do not have: Yes, I cannot snap my fingers and summon the Polish king into this room. We do not know what moves them. We hope to invite them into an alliance and attack the Ottomans together. That is why the structure we set up is so important. If I meet with them, I have the authority to bind the entire alliance. And that there is a structure that fighting the Ottomans actually is rewarded. The structure would be something like this: The kingdoms of Naples, Aragon, Castile and perhaps Portugal enter into a strong alliance of crowns. My family sits on these thrones so I hold much direct control over them already. Any lands taken from the Ottomans will be distributed using the crusade system. The reconquista, a concept familiar to the Iberians. The Poles and the Hungarians already border the Ottomans. I think it will not take much to convince them to attack with us. But only if we are serious about attacking them and the Ottomans are seriously occupied. That is why the structure is so important. If we attack them from all sides, Hungary and Poland gain lands and they press forward and what was once Greek lands will be reconquered. We may yet lose. We may yet be defeated. But if we have a good plan and the Byzantines choose to fight, I think we should."

The monks will not become knights. That is not our tradition. But they could support knights. Pray for them. Bless them. Tend their wounded. Copy their letters. Preserve their names for history. The monasteries were fortresses once, in darker times. Some still have walls. They could shelter refugees, store supplies, serve as waypoints. And there is this: we have priests who fight. Not officially. Not with the Patriarch's blessing. But village priests who took up swords against raiders. Monks who died on the walls in sieges past. The tradition exists, even if we do not speak of it. If you want the Orthodox church to fight—truly fight—you do not create military orders. You create a holy cause. A crusade in all but name. You have the Emperor proclaim that the defense of Constantinople is sacred duty. You have priests preach it from every pulpit. You have monks process through the streets with icons and relics, blessing the soldiers, cursing the enemy. The Patriarch would hate it.

Central in the planning has been that we are not making demands, but we rather are presenting a choice. A choice that will allow the empire to drive the muslims from the lands and unite with our christian brothers of the latin tradition. Like I told you yesterday, the religeous aspects will remain as they are. There are latin and orthodox traditions and they will exist in peace beside one another. Like brothers and sisters living in peace together. A great way to improve the population, trade and alliances of the city will be to let latins own and live in the city itself. This will boost the revenue and trade, but also will increase the population greatly. The city needs this economic impulse. Taxes will be extracted by crown appointed servants and will flow directy to the treasury. We re-institute the ancient noble obligation that all nobles must fight under the crown when called. Since not only the city of Constantinople can win this war, we need the aid of christian kingdoms as well. I will secure the kingdoms of Naples, Aragon and Castille under my rule. The best way to make this alliance iron-clad is to declare empire and include Constantinople in this as well. Emperor John is considering if this is in his best interest and in the interest of his family and his legacy. But it is a powerful weapon should we choose to include it. We present this plan to the Byzantine people and if they choose to accept it, they also accept my command. A choice. My offer of refuge in my kingdom stands, as do my gifts. Should the Byzantine people choose not to have me lead the defence, then I will simply sail away and will keep you in my prayers. So, that is what was discussed yesterday."

I offer refuge for those willing to come and will fully respect both your culture and religion. The city will fall to the turks, but at least you are safe in a place where you can keep your religion alive. The second choice is to let me lead the fight against the Ottomans. I will bring the sword of christianity down on the turks and will drive them from the continent. I can only do this if you as well commit to this fight. If we fight then we fight with everything we have and with everyone. I will implement the ancient noble obligations again and we turn our full attention to not only survive but to restore the city to it's glory. Latins will be allowed to own property, giving the city some much needed work and population. We need to grow is we need to win. I will bring thousands of christian soldiers to this fight. If we win, latin christians and orthodox christians will live side by side as brothers under the rule of an orthodox king. I fully realize that I ask you to place your trust in me and that latin kings have betrayed you before. Therefore, I ask you not to choose today, but to rather think about it and make the choice later, after a few years when you have had time to think about it. The third choice is what happens when the city rejects the other choices. I will have repaired your walls and I will leave back to Iberia. I will not help those who do not want help. The past few days, I have spent speaking with those who will make this choice. And it only seemed proper to inform the citizens as well. And to enjoy this old location again. It is overdue some good use. We will have some races later. But first, let's discuss what the city should do."

The main gate stood open, Byzantine regulars in their positions. They did not move to stop Juan's column. But their eyes followed every rider. Inside the first courtyard, movement.

As soon as my help is accepted, I will activate my forces. They will sail. First, the order of the knights of Rhodes. I will instruct them to increase their number and to be ready to sail to Constantinople as soon as my commander has witnessed that the decree is signed lawfully and is in the possession of a signed copy. He will then send out messages to me and to other forces already positioned to aid. I will come at best speed depending on where I am personally. I will ready an army in Naples and Sicily with plans to reinforce the city when the moment comes. At least 10.000. And the knights of Rhodes will deliver at least 2000 as well. Maybe more.

If your army is already assembled in Sicily, waiting... you could cut that to two weeks. Ten thousand from Naples. Two thousand from Rhodes. Twenty-five thousand as your main force. That's nearly forty thousand men. More than the Turks brought against Thessalonica. Enough to not merely defend but to strike back. The question is time. From the moment the decree is signed to the moment the first knights of Rhodes arrive—one week, perhaps two. From that moment to when your main force arrives—another three weeks, maybe four.

The walls have held against worse odds, when they were properly manned. But only if we have warning. If the Turks march tomorrow, before any of this is in place...

These are good qualities in a man who must wait, and watch, and judge the moment. Bronze ore. That is... We have foundries. We have men who know the craft—the tradition has not entirely died. What we lack is material. The treasury cannot afford to purchase ore at Venetian prices, and what little we had has gone to church bells and desperate repairs. Cannons change sieges. The Turks know this—they have been experimenting, building larger and larger bombards. If we had our own, mounted on the walls, we could break their siege engines before they reach us. Kill their sappers. Shatter their formations as they advance. Give me bronze and time, and I will give you walls that bite back. Your hope is my hope. That wisdom prevails before desperation forces the issue. But I know this city. I know its Emperor, its Patriarch, its nobles. They will debate. They will delay. They will convince themselves that the threat is not imminent, that something will change, that God will provide a miracle that does not require them to swallow their pride. The decree will be signed, if it is signed at all, when Turkish campfires are visible from the walls. When the first stones strike the gates. When it is almost too late. That is why your system of swift response matters so much. We will not have months of warning. We will have weeks. Days, perhaps. But you have given me something I have not had in years. A plan that is not fantasy. Forces that are real, not promised by distant cardinals who never deliver. A timeline measured in weeks, not 'someday' or 'God willing.' I will hold these walls, King of Castile. I will train the militia, enforce the obligations, prepare for the storm. And when the Emperor and Patriarch finally find their courage—or have it forced upon them—I will make certain Sotomayor's message reaches you. Now. Tell me of these Turks you have fought.

I led my heavy cavalry as we rode them down. A crushing victory that set the tone. They would never dare face me in the field again. But the war was far from over. They resorted to attacking our supply lines and would scatter when we formed up. They made us bleed and sweat for every piece of land. My cannons were my strength. They reduced forts in weeks and we assaulted them if they did not surrender. I would always ride out in front of the fort or city myself to demand surrender.

The Patriarch and Notaras have been whispering in his ear ever since—telling him that you seek to supplant him, that your generosity is merely conquest by another name. If you approach him now, asking permission to send ore for cannons... it could go two ways. He might see it as respect. A foreign king acknowledging that the Emperor's consent matters, that Constantinople is still his city. It might begin to heal the breach. Or he might see it as mockery. The conquering Latin, flush with triumph from the Hippodrome, coming to ask permission for a gift the Emperor cannot refuse without looking foolish. Notaras would frame it that way. 'See how he humiliates you, Majesty. He asks for permission he does not need, knowing you must grant it. He makes you a puppet blessing your own subjugation.' I know this Emperor. I have served him for eleven years. He is not a bad man. Not a weak man, not truly. But he has been Emperor of a dying Empire his entire reign. Every year, less territory. Every year, fewer soldiers. Every year, more humiliations. It has... curdled something in him. Made him suspicious of strength, because strength reminds him of his own weakness. My counsel? Yes, approach him. But not alone. Not publicly. And not asking permission—offering consultation. 'Your Imperial Majesty, I intend to send bronze ore to aid in the city's defense. I wished to inform you personally, and to ask if there are other materials the foundries require.' You make the decision, but you give him the dignity of being informed first. You treat him as what he is—the sovereign—without actually needing his approval. But I am a soldier, not a courtier. There are subtleties I may be missing.

The title carried near-royal status; the last holder was Andronikos Palaiologos, the Emperor's own kinsman, who died when the city fell in 1430. Second: Doux of Adrianople — Ancient seat of Thrace. Lost in 1369. The title has been claimed by the Kantakouzenos family in exile, though it means nothing now. Whoever holds Adrianople controls the road to Constantinople. Third: Doux of the Fleet — The Megas Doux. This one still exists in theory—Loukas Notaras holds it. Though what fleet he commands is a question worth asking. A dozen galleys, perhaps. Once it meant hundreds of ships. Fourth: Doux of Mesembria — The Black Sea coast. Lost in 1396. Key to the grain trade from Crimea. The Asanes family held this title; some of their descendants still live in Constantinople. Fifth: Doux of Serres — Eastern Macedonia. Lost to the Serbs, then to the Turks after Kosovo in 1389. The Raoul family had connections there."

Thessalonica and Macedonia: Doux of Thessalonica — Supreme military governor of Macedonia and the second city. Near-royal dignity. Last holder: Andronikos Palaiologos, died 1430. Subordinate titles within the Duchy: Kephale of Thessalonica — Civil governor of the city itself. Responsible for markets, walls, and urban administration. Strategos of the Macedonian Theme — Field commander of the provincial army. Subordinate to the Doux but commanding troops in the field. Prokathemenos of the Harbor — Master of the port. Controlled customs, anchorage fees, naval supplies. Archon of the Lower City — Administrator of the commercial districts and foreign quarters. Kephale of Berroia — Governor of the inland city, second largest in Macedonia. Key position on the western road. Kephale of Edessa — Ancient city north of Thessalonica. Controlled mountain passes toward Serbia. Kephale of Rentina — Fortress town guarding the eastern approaches. Prokathemenos of the Axios Valley — Administrator of the rich agricultural lands along the river. Archon of Kalamaria — Lord of the coastal district east of the city. Kephale of Hierissos — Guardian of the approaches to Mount Athos. Prostates of Mount Athos — Imperial representative to the Holy Mountain. A position of spiritual prestige rather than military power, but significant nonetheless. Noble estates of note: The Metochion of the Philanthropenos — Our family held lands near Berroia for two centuries. The Palaiologos estates along the Axios. The Kantakouzenos properties near Rentina. The Tarchaniotes holdings in Kalamaria. Adrianople and Thrace: Doux of Adrianople — Military governor of Thrace. Commands the heartland between Constantinople and the Danube. Lost 1369. The Kantakouzenos family claims this title in exile. Subordinate titles within the Duchy: Kephale of Adrianople — Civil governor of the city. Now the Ottoman capital; they call it Edirne. Strategos of the Thracian Theme — Field commander. Once one of the most important military posts in the Empire. Kephale of Didymoteichon — Governor of the fortress city on the Maritsa River. Lost 1361. Once an imperial residence. Kephale of Tzurulum — Modern Çorlu. Controls the road from Constantinople to Adrianople. Kephale of Arcadiopolis — Lost 1365. Strategic junction town. Kephale of Bizye — Northern Thracian fortress. Lost 1373. Prokathemenos of the Ergene Valley — Rich agricultural lands, now Turkish. Archon of Mesene — Coastal district along the Marmara shore. Kephale of Selymbria — This one we still hold, barely. Twenty miles from Constantinople. Often raided. Kephale of Herakleia — On the Marmara coast. Technically ours; practically contested. Kephale of Raidestos — Lost 1354. Important port on the Marmara. Noble estates of note: The Palaiologos ancestral lands near Didymoteichon."

Kantakouzenos arrived early and claimed a seat near the window, watching the courtyard below—watching, no doubt, for any sign of Notaras's men. The families filter in over the next hour. The Asanes send their patriarch, a white-bearded man who walks with a cane and studies the maps with hungry eyes—his family's name is written beside Mesembria. The Raoul contingent arrives in force: three brothers, all soldiers, all wearing swords despite the supposed peace of a council. One of the Melissenos cousins sits across from them, and neither party acknowledges the other. The Laskaris representative is young—a grandson of a grandson, his claim to Nicaea so distant that most have forgotten it exists. But he came. The Bryennios family sends a single man who sits in the back, arms crossed, face unreadable. And then there are others: minor houses, cadet branches, men whose grandfathers held kephalates that no longer exist. They crowd the benches, lean against walls, peer over shoulders at the catalogue of everything their families lost. Notaras has not come. Neither has the Emperor. Neither has the Patriarch.

First, we must secure the city of Constantinople. This is our base of operation, our axis and anchor. We allow latins to own property in the city and we establish the mercantile courts to let trade give the economic and population boom the city needs. The city has been reducing in number every year. We must turn this around. We start building up our strength, we repair the walls, place cannons and eliminate the threat of immediate attack by the Ottomans. Then we can start planning our offence. I command a lot of forces and will gradually deploy them in this area. This will require the construction of transport fleets but with the fleets of Castille, Aragon and Naples combined in alliance, we can do this. I will come through Hungary in the beginning, weakening the Ottomans and retaking their lands is in their best interest. I have a military academy that studies Ottoman tactics and my officers will deploy these tactics and lessons in battle against them. I command personally the military orders numbering 5000 men and Castille fields 45.000 men in the field. History teaches us that with proper motivation, a crusade can field many times that number. My family controls many crowns of lands that were once part of a great empire and I will forge an alliance against the Ottomans that includes these kingdoms. We are restoring Roman glory so let the kingdoms from Naples to Iberia join in the fight as well. But I must also be honest. I cannot lay out an exact battle of campaign plan yet for re-conquest. Too much is yet unknown for we must first build up our own strength, make the city ready to receive and house an army that can face the Ottomans in the field. But I do know that the kingdoms that I command right now. The crowns of Leon and Castille. Combined with the crowns I am heir to - the crowns of Aragon and Naples. I directly command crowns to challenge the Ottomans. Add to that Constantinople that is not reducing in population and trade, but is becoming strong again. Combine that with a strong naval alliance with either Venice or Genoa. Add to that the knowledge that crusades can field armies in support. Add to that an alliance with Hungary and Poland who are waiting for years for a chance to take the fight to the Ottomans. Add the holy orders the church command and can commit to this fight. While none of this is set in stone yet, it is an array of forces so formidable we need not to have all to have such an advantage against the Ottomans that victory does not seem far-fetched to me."

I will give you honesty. My grandfather fought at the walls in 1204. Not against Turks. Against Latins. Against crusaders who came to help us. They burned the greatest library in Christendom.

Greeks race against Greeks in the first heat—we have four teams, organized by district. The old faction colors are gone, but the competition remains. The second heat: Italians. Venetians against Genoese. We keep the course wide. For safety. Third heat: mixed. One Greek team, one Italian, one Castilian. This is... new. There was much discussion about whether it was appropriate. I decided it was appropriate. Between the heats: mounted demonstrations. Your Castilian knights will show horsemanship—the exercises they practice for war. Riding at rings, sword work from horseback, formation drills. The Greeks are curious about Western cavalry tactics. Let them see. After the races: a melee. Blunted weapons, no killing, first man unhorsed or disarmed loses. Greeks, Italians, Castilians, all mixed together. Eight men. The winner receives a purse of fifty florins and a silver cup. There was a request—from some of the younger Greek nobles—for a joust. Proper tilting, with lances. I told them this is not a Greek tradition, but they insisted they wished to try. If you permit, we could add it at the end. Informal. A demonstration, not a competition."

Each represents a district of Constantinople—not the old Blues and Greens of the faction riots, but neighborhoods: Blachernae, Phanar, Kontoskalion, and the harbor district near the Golden Gate. The horses are not the magnificent beasts of the old chronicles; they are sturdy, practical animals, the best the diminished city can muster. But their riders sit straight, and the ribbons on their harnesses catch the morning light. Theodoros raises a white cloth. The crowd falls quiet. The cloth drops. The horses surge forward, hooves thundering on the ancient track. The crowd rises to its feet. Lucia leans forward. Catalina shrieks with delight at the noise and motion, clapping her small hands. The Blachernae rider takes an early lead—a young man on a chestnut mare, riding low and fast. The Phanar team presses close behind. Kontoskalion and Golden Gate fall back, fighting for third. Then, on the second turn, the Blachernae mare stumbles. A gasp ripples through the crowd. The rider nearly falls, catches himself, loses three lengths. The Phanar horse surges past, then Kontoskalion. The young man from Blachernae is suddenly last, his mare limping slightly, the race seemingly lost. But he does not stop. He speaks to the horse—those nearby swear they can see his lips moving—and something changes. The mare steadies. Her stride evens. And slowly, impossibly, she begins to gain ground. The crowd notices. Murmurs become shouts. By the third turn, Blachernae has passed Golden Gate. By the fourth, Kontoskalion. The Phanar rider glances back, sees death coming, and whips his horse frantically. It is not enough. The chestnut mare crosses the finish line half a length ahead, her rider's face streaked with dust and tears. He slides from her back and embraces her neck, and the horse—as if she knows what she has done—stands perfectly still. The Hippodrome erupts. Not faction against faction. Not district against district. Simply thousands of people who have just witnessed something they will tell their grandchildren about: the day the lame horse won. The Asanes patriarch is on his feet, pounding his cane against the stone. The Bryennioi are applauding. Somewhere in the common stands, a chant begins—the rider's name, repeated over and over: 'Stavros! Stavros! Stavros!'"

Upon a grandfather who died defending the walls of Serres. Upon three generations of military service to the city and its people. Upon the principle that some things cannot be written on parchment—that there is a law older than ink. Both claims have merit. This was not an easy decision. The tribunal rules in favor of House Raoul. The Doux of Serres, upon its liberation, shall be confirmed to House Raoul. Their claim by blood and sacrifice outweighs the claim by charter and record. The dissenting vote held that documentation must take precedence. This dissent is recorded and respected. House Melissenos is recognized for their historical connection to the Strymon Valley. The tribunal recommends that, upon liberation, they be granted the prokathemenos of the Strymon—the office their ancestors held before the fall.

A cross of light, blazing above the sun. And with it, words: En toutō níka. In Greek. 'In this sign, conquer.'

Yesterday we were preparing for the inevitable day when Ottomans would break through our walls and finally take from us whatever is left of our empire. Yesterday, we feared each other. We were afraid to lose what little we had left. Today, we turn the page. Today, we decide that we shall be afraid no more! That from this day forward we shall not go quietly into the night! We shall not vanish without a fight. Today is a new dawn for the empire. No longer will we lose ground to the muslims, but we start taking it back. Long has the Byzantine empire been asking the west for aid. And for a long time, we have been wondering what that aid would even look like. Now we know. The only way forward is when Greeks and Latins work together, when we no longer fear each other and hide behind walls. We are christians and it's time we remembered that. And you have, when you named me defensor. Defensor...a name chosen carefully. I am not here to dominate, or to conquer. No. I am here to reclaim, to protect. Why do we fight? Not because of greed, no. We fight to free our brothers and sisters from the yoke of the true opressors, the sultan and his janissaries. How many times do mothers have to clutch their sons to their chests, in fear of the dreaded blood tax? How much longer do we have to face our own kin in battle who have been stripped of their identity, their culture and their faith? How cruel can one be to twist young boys so? No! I will not stand for it. We will not stand for it. I will always place myself between any mother and this evil and say 'Not today!' For I am not just a general, a soldier, a father. I am Defensor Romaniae and I will protect and defend. Today under this sun begins the Reclaiming, the Apokatastasis. Everyone fights. And if we all put our strength into it, then we will reclaim that what was lost. We will mend that was broken. We will make the lord smile as he looks down upon us and he will se his name honoured and his praises sung. An empire worth fighting for and a future worth dying for. To Victory!"

Smiths know metal but not how to use it against a man trying to kill them. But they have fire. That counts for something. Fire can be shaped, if the shapers know their work. For trainers, Defensor, we have several options. First: my own Tagmata officers. Professional soldiers, Byzantine-born, Greek-speaking. They know how to train men for wall defense—that is what they do. But they are few, and they are needed for palace security. I can spare perhaps five men for training duty without compromising our position. Second: the wall garrison veterans. Kantakouzenos has men who have stood on those walls for twenty years. They know siege defense better than anyone alive. Some are too old for front-line duty but would make excellent drill instructors. The Strategos could identify a dozen such men, perhaps more. Third: the noble household guards. The committed houses—Philanthropenos, Doukas, Tornikes—they have men who know how to fight. Not all are needed for their lords' immediate service. A rotation could be arranged—each house contributing one or two experienced soldiers to the training cadre. Fourth: your Castilians. They know infantry tactics—real tactics, tested against the Moors. Your tercios broke Granada. If you could spare officers to teach formation fighting, close-quarters combat, the discipline that holds a line when men are dying around you... My recommendation is a combination. Byzantine officers for basic drill, wall defense, and discipline—they speak the language, they understand the men, they can earn trust quickly. Castilian officers for combat tactics—formation fighting, coordinated maneuvers, the things that turn a militia into an army that can take the field, not just hold walls. There is one other matter, Defensor. The Taktikon specifies forty days of basic training. These men have trades, families, obligations. Forty consecutive days away from their work means forty days without income. Some will struggle to feed their families during training. The military treasury can provide basic rations during training—the Taktikon allows for this. But if we want these men to train well, without distraction, without worry about hungry children at home... we may need to provide more. A small stipend, perhaps. Enough to replace lost wages. It is an investment, Defensor. Two hundred men now could become two thousand if word spreads that the themata treats its soldiers fairly. Or it could collapse if these first volunteers return to their quarters complaining of empty bellies and broken promises."

Common laborers: Three hyperpyra per day, forty days—that is one hundred twenty hyperpyra. Skilled craftsmen: Five hyperpyra per day, forty days—that is two hundred hyperpyra.

Thirty thousand hyperpyra. Or approximately two thousand to twenty-five hundred florins.

Men die on both sides in that first instant—French knights spitted on Castilian spears, infantry trampled beneath iron-shod hooves. But the line holds. The veterans of Granada do not break.

Fifteen thousand men required transport from Castile to Palermo. We chartered Aragonese and Genoese vessels—King Alfonso assisted with some ships, but the bulk of the cost fell to us. Ship hire, provisioning for the voyage, replacement of horses lost at sea... King Alfonso was indeed generous with supply once the army reached Sicily and Naples. But the initial provisioning—food, fodder, ammunition, medical supplies—was borne by the crown. An army of that size consumes enormously. The levies served without direct pay, as is their feudal obligation for campaign service. However, we compensated losses—horses, equipment, men-at-arms who fell. The battle at Aversa was decisive but not without cost. In total, Your Majesty, the Naples expedition cost the crown approximately... Forty-two thousand florins.

And the Constantinople expenditures—the sixty thousand for the walls, the two thousand for Rhodes—these were drawn from the crusade treasury, which Your Majesty transferred to the joint administration with the Emperor. That is Byzantine-Castilian money now, not crown revenue. So, to correct myself: the true one-time burden on the Castilian crown treasury for 1434 is the Naples expedition—forty-two thousand florins in transport, supply, and compensation, plus the forty thousand sent earlier for the Sforza contract. Eighty-two thousand total for Naples. Journey costs for the royal fleet—supplies, crew wages, port fees—perhaps another three to four thousand florins over the course of the year. Approximately eighty-five to eighty-six thousand florins in extraordinary expenses, Your Majesty. The crown treasury can bear this, but it is not insignificant."

Galleys—the weapon of Mediterranean war. Fast, maneuverable, independent of wind. The Ottomans use them extensively. But they cannot make the Atlantic voyage safely, they require enormous crews of rowers, and they carry little cargo. Galleasses—a compromise. Larger than galleys, they combine oars and sails. Venice uses them. They can fight and carry modest cargo. But they are expensive and complex. A fleet to do what Your Majesty describes would need all three types, I think. Carracks for transport and heavy combat. Galleys for battle and protecting the carracks in calm waters. Perhaps smaller vessels—caravels, pinnaces—for scouting and communication."
